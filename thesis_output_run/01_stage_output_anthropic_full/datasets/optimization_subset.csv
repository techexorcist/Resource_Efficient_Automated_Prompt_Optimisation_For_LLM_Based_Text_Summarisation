Not hurt by comparison with General Dyer: Army chief,"Army chief Bipin Rawat today looked unfazed by his comparison to General Dyer of the infamous Jallianwala Bagh incident. He said, ""See, I am an Army officer, just anything cannot affect me. You have to be prepared to face such.

"EC demands 74,000 jawans for J&K's Anantnag by-polls","New Delhi, Apr 27 (PTI) The Election Commission has sought an unprecedented 74,000 paramilitary personnel from the Centre for deployment during the bypoll to the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency on May 25. The EC has conveyed to the Home Ministry that 740 companies of paramilitary forces should be put at its disposal by May 12, official sources said. A company comprises around 100 paramilitary personnel. The demand seemed unprecedented as the poll body had sought 70,000 paramilitary forces for deployment in the recently concluded Assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh which has 403 Assembly constituencies and 80 Lok Sabha seats. Earlier, the EC had sought 30,000 paramilitary personnel for the bypoll to Srinagar and Anantnag Lok Sabha seats. While polling in Srinagar was held on April 9 amidst massive violence, polling for Anantnag, which was scheduled for April 12, was postponed till May 25. Official sources said that in normal circumstances around 10 companies (1,000 personnel) are deployed in a parliamentary seat during polling. The Home Ministry is likely to tell the EC that it would be difficult to arrange such a large number of security personnel in a short span of time and it may seek more time.",general,1240,52,70
"Man gets ?70,000 in place of ?3,500 from ATM in Rajasthan","The whir of the ATM machine sounded very reassuring for Jitesh Diwakar, a resident of Tonk in Rajasthan. But he was not prepared for what followed ? an avalanche of cash for Diwakar who got Rs 70,000 in place of just Rs 3,500 he had typed in.Diwakar was among several people who turned richer after a malfunctioning ATM rained cash on Tuesday evening at the Rajasthan town, about 80 km from capital Jaipur.But he was the only person who chose to inform the Bank of Baroda about the malfunctioning cash-dispensing machine ? all others before him went home with extra cash, thanking their lucky stars.?I immediately called my father who arrived with my uncle and we informed the bank manager,? Diwakar said.By the time bank officials shut down the ATM near the collector?s office, it had dispensed Rs 6.76 lakh. And 10-odd people are believed to have got excess cash when the ATM gave out 2000-rupee notes in place of 100-rupee-notes.Tonk Harishankar Meena, chief manager of the bank?s collectorate circle, said 2000-rupee notes were loaded in the slot meant for 100-rupee notes, resulting in the malfunction.Following the shock recall of high-value banknotes in November, banks have recalibrated two lakh-odd ATMs across the country to dispense the newly-designed Rs 2000 and Rs 500 notes. However, ATM glitches have been reported from several parts of the country over the past two months.?Technically, Rs 2,000 notes cannot be loaded in the Rs 100 cassette as the sensors won?t accept it. That?s why we have called technical experts to investigate how this happened,? Meena said.He said the bank will lodge a complaint with police against the people who took away the excess cash and that efforts were on to identify them.?Out of all these people, only one person contacted and brought the matter to our notice. We have taken a back-up of the ATM machine (records) from which we will get information of the people who withdrew money in these two hours. After tracking them we will ask them to return the extra money,? said Meena.??Local shopkeepers told me that people coming to the ATM were suddenly leaving very happy? and smiling,?

Woman kills sister for showing interest in her boyfriend,"Growing closeness with her sister?s boyfriend claimed the life of a 24-year-old woman in northeast Delhi?s Shastri Park near Seelampur last week. The woman, identified as Sonam, was shot dead at point blank range by her sister Shazia using a country made pistol at their home on December 14. The pistol belonged to the boyfriend of the accused. He used to hide the gun at her house. Both Shazia and Sonam were divorced.On Monday, the northeast district police arrested 21-year-old Shazia and recovered the weapon of offence, even as she tried convincing the police that her sister was killed by her stalker who had been harassing her for the past some months. Police said Shazia cooked up the stalking story to mislead the probe.A senior police officer said that during the questioning, Shazia disclosed the alleged involvement of her boyfriend Waseem. She said that he gave her the idea of killing Sonam. The couple was angry with Sonam as she had threatened to reveal their relationship to their parents. Sonam had also allegedly started showing interest in Waseem. AK Single, deputy commissioner of police (northeast), said that last week, Shazia and Sonam entered into an argument over this. ?Their fight turned into a scuffle during which Shazia took out her boyfriend?s pistol and shot Sonam at point blank range,? Single said. As Sonam collapsed, Shazia rushed out with the pistol and went to the house of her neighbour Abid, who had been introduced to her by Waseem. She left the pistol at Abid?s home and returned.Shazia informed her parents who were out at that time. They returned home and rushed Sonam to a nearby hospital where doctors pronounced her dead on admission. The hospital authorities then called the police. The police took Sonam?s father into custody for questioning as the family had not informed them about the firing. Shazia and other relatives were also questioned. ?She initially tried misleading us with a stalking story which she cooked up to hide her own crime. But as her behaviour was suspicious and there were discrepancies in her statement, we questioned her separately during which she confessed to the crime,? said the officer.Waseem and Abid were absconding after the crime and teams have been formed to nab them. The police want to know why Waseem had kept the pistol at Shazia?s home. ?Whether Waseem has a criminal background can be confirmed only when we arrest and question him. The antecedents of Abid are also being verified,? the officer said.",general,2493,56,70

West Bengal: 2 dead as villagers clash over power project,"Two people were killed and many wounded in clashes that broke out during protests against a power grid project in West Bengal?s South 24 Parganas district on Tuesday, bringing back memories of the tumultuous days of anti-land acquisition agitations in Singur and Nandigram. Both victims in Bhangar died of bullet injuries, but villagers said police did not fire at them and alleged the involvement of supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress, which blamed people ?against development? for the violence. In the previous Left regime, there was an attempt to acquire land in Bhangar, but the state government retreated in the face of fierce protests in Singur and Nandigram led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was then the opposition leader.The situation had been tense in Bhangar from Monday evening, when police picked up two activists --- before releasing them an hour later under the instructions of top officials at the state secretariat. On Tuesday morning, irate villagers vandalised police vehicles and set at least three buses on fire. They uprooted trees, blocked roads with the trunks and hurled brickbats at the police for hours. Mofijul Khan and Alam Mollah died in the firing that ensued. ?Supporters of Arabul Islam (a local TMC leader) shot my brother,? alleged Khan?s brother. CM Banerjee rushed leaders such as Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy and minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah to talk to the agitators, who demanded the cancellation of the project.The project, undertaken by the Powergrid Corporation of India, is nearing completion on a 16-acre plot that was acquired a couple of years ago. Villagers are also objecting to high-tension lines passing over their land. ?Work on the project stands suspended,? power minister Sovandeb Chatterjee told HT. Sharmistha Chowdhury, one of the leaders of the movement, said the residents gathered at the site in the morning after a huge contingent of police entered the villages of Khamar Ait, Nutanhaat and Machhibhanga. ?As the police tried to disperse the gathering by firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets, the situation went out of control,? said Chowdhury.The villagers? movement is spearheaded by Jomi, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee (Committee to protect land, livelihood, environment and ecosystem). The committee is guided by CPI-ML (Red Star),?a little-known Naxalite outfit. Turning the tables on Banerjee, the CPI-M came out in support of the farmers at Bhangar and threatened to hit the streets if police forces were not withdrawn. ?Police acted on the orders from the chief minister who herself had organised movements against land acquisition during the Left regime. But now she is busy organising global business summits,? said CPI-M state secretariat member Md Salim.He criticised state minister and local MLA Moollah, who was the land reforms minister during the Left regime, and said: ?Bhangar?s uncrowned king was sitting silently while tension was building up.?Echoing what the Left leaders said during their rule, Trinamool Congress vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy said: ?Those creating disturbances are against development.??We are against land being taken away forcibly for any project,? said state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury.",general,3251,57,70

I'd be a farmer if Saif's point on genetics is true: Kangana,"All hell broke loose when Karan Johar, Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan took a dig at Kangana Ranaut at the recently held IIFA Awards. Unless you have been living under a rock, you know that Kangana had called Karan the ""flag-bearer of nepotism"" on his show. The comment snowballed into a huge debate, with fans supporting Kangana for bravely taking on Bollywood's big daddies.The debate was reignited at the IIFA Awards this year, when Varun came on stage to receive an award. Saif joked, ""You are here because of your papa (director David Dhawan)."" Varun responded, ""And you're here because of your mummy (veteran actress Sharmila Tagore)."" Karan joined in and said, ""I am here because of my papa (late filmmaker Yash Johar).""The trio then chanted in unison, ""Nepotism rocks"". They then broke into the song Bole Chudiye Bole Kangana, at which point Karan interjected, ""Kangana nahi bole toh achcha hai, bahut bolti hai.""The act caused outrage on social media and Karan, Saif and Varun were forced to apologise. Saif went a step further and wrote an open letter (first published in DNA), prompting Kangana to finally break her silence and pen her own open letter in Mid-Day.She said that the last time she was ""deeply pained and upset"" about the subject was when Karan dismissed talent as one of the main criteria for making it big in Bollywood. Citing the examples of legends like Dilip Kumar, Satyajit Ray and Guru Dutt, Kangana said that discrediting talent was ""absolutely bizarre."" The actor added that there are plenty of instances to prove that ""genuine hard work"" exists, ""beyond the superficiality of branded clothes and polished accents.""Talking about Saif's letter, she dismissed his statement that people need to ""take a chill pill and back off"" because he has already apologised to her. ""This is not my issue alone,"" Kangana wrote, adding that nepotism ""fails the test of objectivity and rationale."" She added that Swami Vivekananda, Albert Einstein and William Shakespeare ""didn't belong to a select few, they belonged to collective humanity.""She also addressed his remark that it was easy to confuse nepotism with genetics. Saif had written, ""People are interested in what their (superstars') children will be like and whether they will have the genes of their parents, in terms of their talent. If you need another example, then take race horses. We take a derby winner, mate him with the right mate and see if we can create another grand national winner. So, in that sense, this is the relationship between genetics and star kids.""""I fail to understand how you can compare genetically hybrid racehorses to artistes,"" Kangana wrote, asking if Saif believed that talent and dedication was only hereditary. ""If your point was true, I would be a farmer back home,"" she said.The Queen actor added, ""You also spoke of eugenics - which means controlled breeding of the human race. So far, I believe that the human race hasn't found the DNA that can pass on greatness and excellence. If it had, we would've loved to repeat the greatness of Einstein, Da Vinci, Shakespeare, Vivekananda, Stephen Hawking, Terence Tao, Daniel Day-Lewis, or Gerhard Richter.""Saif had blamed the media for perpetrating nepotism. He had said that his son, Taimur, was a paparazzi favourite before he turned a year old and is already hyped to be the ""next big thing."" It is only a matter of time before a producer cashes in on all that hype. Kangana rebutted with, ""No one is putting a gun to anyone's head to hire talent they don't believe in. So, there is no need to get defensive about one's choices.""Is there going to be a round two of debate? Let's wait and watch.",general,3653,60,70

AAP MLAs cross-voted in presidential polls: BJP,"The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed on Monday that few Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators cross-voted in favour of NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind, which was a ?signal? to the upheaval in the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. Leader of opposition Vijender Gupta, who was the polling agent for Kovind, said that AAP MLAs were deeply ?anguished? with the stand taken by its top leadership. ?The party had always stood against the Congress. But the Presidential election brought the party in line with the Congress and United Progressive Alliance (UPA). A number of MLAs had already threatened to vote against the UPA candidate.

"Every dog has his day, Vivian Richards tells BCCI","The International Cricket Council (ICC) will be sitting this month, over the contentious issue of revenue sharing.One way or the other the decision coming out of the ICC boardroom will reflect on the influence the richest cricket board BCCI wields in decision making. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) contends it stands to lose as many as 330$ upwards in the revised distribution model for 2015-23 period passed at the last ICC meet. BCCI is fighting tooth and nail to preserve their supremacy in ICC money matters resulting out of the Big three formula' that was passed in 2014 which guaranteed them 21 percent upwards of total revenue. While the BCCI argues they are only asking what they deserve because cricket commerce revolves around Indian cricket, these claims are rubbished by one of the game's greatest name Sir Vivian Richards.

South Delhi to install 100 mobile toilet vans,"The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to install 100 mobile toilet vans at jhuggis/ slum clusters falling under its jurisdiction, inorder to achieve 100% open defecation-free (ODF) tag. The civic agency has invited tenders for installing the toilet vans at earmarked sites across 104 wards on Friday. An amount of Rs 12 crore has been allocated for the project.According to officials, the project aims to supplement the efforts of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and Railways ?the agencies responsible for providing infrastructure facilities in slums.?Densely populated areas, especially those located close to railway lines, have no space for constructing community toilets. That?s why we have decided to place mobile toilet vans here. These includes slum clusters in Okhla, Nizamuddin and Tuglakabad,? said a senior official from department of environment management services, SDMC.?During the survey, we also found that colonies like Sangam Vihar have no sewer lines. Since the work doesn?t belong to us, we have decided to place mobile vans to stop people from defecating in the open,? the official said.According to parameters of the Swachh Bharat Mission, any urban local body can declare its wards ODF only if it is successful in providing public conveniences at 75% of its areas. Also, there should be provision for toilets within 500 metres of slum settlements.Assuming that these norms would be fulfilled over the period of time, the South Corporation, in May, made its preliminary resolution public and declared 92 of 104 wards open defecation-free. The agency had invited feedback and objections from residents, but failed to get any response.However, later on, during the meetings with officials of various agencies (whose land fall under the SDMC?s jurisdiction) it was found that people living in slums (located near railway tracks) are still defecating in the open.?This increased our worries as implementation of the project was not as simple as it looked. We had to request the DUSIB and Railways to speed up construction of toilets and if there is no land, they should approach other agencies,? said a senior official.But since the implementation of this was taking time, the agency decided to place mobile toilets. ?We want everything to be in place before the Gandhi Jayanti (October 2), when Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will also complete its three years,? said the official. After SDMC?s final resolution, an independent team from the ministry of urban development will conduct survey of these areas before declaring them ODF.",general,2576,45,70

Recorded every meeting with Trump as he may lie: Ex-FBI boss,"3.38pm BST 15:38 Now Warner?s up. He begins by revisiting the ?smear? of Comey?s character following his firing. Warner is going to talk about Comey?s meeting with the president. He starts with the first meeting Comey described, in which Comey briefed the president on the Steele dossier.Why did Comey decide to document that discussion. What was it about that meeting?Comey replies:?A combination of things. The circumstances, the subject matter and the person I was interacting with.?Comey says he was alone with the president-elect discussing weighty matters.Then:I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it was important to document it.Updated at 3.53pm BST 3.36pm BST 15:36 Burr asks Comey whether he doubts that the congressional committee plus Bob Mueller can get to the bottom of the Russia affair.No doubt, Comey says. 3.35pm BST 15:35 Burr is back to Comey?s decision to talk about Clinton?s emails. He asks whether attorney general Loretta Lynch?s tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton influenced his decision.?That was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately,? Comey said.Comey says he was ?confused and concerned? that Lynch directed Comey to call the Clinton email affair not an investigation but a ?matter.? That was ?one of the bricks in the load? that convinced him to act unilaterally, he said. 3.33pm BST 15:33 Question: When did you first become aware of Russian cyberintrusion?A: There were a lot of them. Late summer 2015. ?There was a massive effort.?Comey says Russians targeted ?hundreds, I suppose it could be more than a thousand? entities in an attempt to crack the US election.He says in late 2015 or early 2016 he became aware that data had been exfiltrated.He says the FBI undertook an effort to notify victims of the ?massive spearfishing campaign.?Comey says the Obama administration was looking for ways to fight the cyberattack. This all happened out of the public view, of course, while Comey stepped forward to give multiple updates in the Clinton emails inquiry. 3.30pm BST 15:30 Burr is on to the so-called Steele dossier, an intelligence file on Trump produced by a former British intelligence officer. Comey is asked whether the FBI confirmed any criminal allegations in the dossier. He declines to comment in an open setting. 3.28pm BST 15:28 Comey says ?honestly no? he would not have acted differently in advising the public and Congress about the Clinton emails investigation. 3.28pm BST 15:28 Comey: In any complex investigation, when you start turning over rocks, sometimes you find things unrelated to the primary investigation that are criminal in nature. 3.27pm BST 15:27 Burr turns to Michael Flynn. He says Flynn had unreported contacts with the Russians.Was general Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy. Do you think the president was trying to obstruct justice or just give Flynn a way to save face??Obstruct justice? ? Burr?s phrase.Comey says it?s not for him to say whether what the president did amounts to obstruction. 3.26pm BST 15:26 Burr asked Comey whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, reviewed his testimony.No.Comey says he has ?no doubt? that the Russian government was behind various intrusions in the election and attempts to tamper.Are you confident that no votes... were altered?Comey: ?I?m confident.?Did the president ask you to stop the Russia investigation?Not to my understanding, no. 3.24pm BST 15:24 In a poignant moment, Comey tells his former colleagues he is ?so sorry? he wasn?t able to say goodbye to them.Then he offers his testimonial:?The FBI is honest, the FBI is strong, and the FBI is and always will be independent.?",general,3777,60,70
Vidya Balan's Begum Jaan denied release in Pak,"Vidya Balan starrer Begum Jaan, written and directed by National award-winning filmmaker Srijit Mukherji, has been banned in Pakistan. Produced by Mahesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films, the movie is a story of survival set against the backdrop of the India-Pak partition and its impact on a brothel. Speaking exclusively to India Today TV, Mahesh Bhatt explained that Pakistan does not screen films which revolve around the partition era. ""I was told by my distributor that Pakistan has a policy does not permit the import of films which deal with the issue of partition. On learning this I requested the key officer of the censor board of Pakistan to at least view the film and then take a decision. I was assured that they would look into the matter. Sadly, I have not heard from them after that,"" he said.Bhatt also added, ""Later my distributor informed me that his office has been intimated that Begum Jaan should not be imported by him into Pakistan.""Co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Chunky Pandey, Ila Arun, Gauahar Khan in key roles, Begum Jaan, the Hindi remake of the critically acclaimed Bengali film Rajkahini (2015) is all set to hit theatres on April 14. Interestingly this news comes just days after Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal did not hit theatres across the border.

Producer Aamir Khan refused to abide by the two cuts and chose not to release the film in the neighboring country.More recently, Tapsee Pannu's Naam Shabana didn't see the light of day in Pakistan, due to 'terrorism-related scenes,' and Jolly LLB 2 too irked the Pakistan authorities since it had discussions around the Kashmir issue.

Would like some animal spirit in Indian entrepreneurs: Kotak,"From Barun Jha Davos, Jan 22 (PTI) Confident of India gaining its ""rightful place"" in coming years on the world stage alongside the US and China, ace banker Uday Kotak has said Indian corporates also need to combine some ""animal spirit"" with their judicious capital allocation for their own business growth and add to the economys expansion. The Kotak group chief, who has steered one of the most successful banking and financial services sector stories in recent years in India, also favoured nudge from the government and policymakers to the corporates to get that ""animal spirit"" and said the country should also incentivise delta jobs created in any country. Kotak, who was here to attend the World Economic Forum annual meeting that saw China positioning itself as a new champion of globalisation, told PTI in an interview that India has to take its rightful place over the next 5-10 years and the institutions like his will have to contribute to that journey. On Indian corporates in the past having started to look overseas for expansion through acquisitions, but the process stopping thereafter, Kotak said, ""That also probably because of the reason that they did not necessarily take the best capital decisions and probably our timing was wrong."" Asked whether India Inc has learnt its lessons, he said, ""I think, it has. The private sector has become more careful and more sort of thoughtful and therefore, we are seeing a slowdown in investments -- both in terms of external investments as well as within India. ""To a certain extent, we need to get the balance right between judicious capital allocation with a little bit of animal spirit. At this stage, what I would like to see in India is that a little bit of animal spirit in business and entrepreneurs came back. ""A nudge from the government and policymakers that we would love to see growth in businesses and entrepreneurship would certainly be helpful and welcome."" He agreed this would also help many from the start-up ecosystem move to the mainstream business arena. Kotak further said this balance between judicious capital allocation and animal spirit would need to be a high focus area as the jobs would finally happen only through successful business growth. Optimistic about job creation, going ahead, Kotak said, ""I am a great believer that India should incentivise delta jobs created in any sector."" Asked whether more acquisitions are in store for Kotak group itself, he said, ""We are still a small company in global scheme of things.",general,2513,60,70

PM Modi favours higher taxes from market participants,"Ahead of the budget, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today favoured increasing the tax contribution from various market participants in a ""fair, efficient and transparent way"" and promised more ""sound and prudent policies and reform measures"". Asking the regulators and taxmen to think about the contribution of market participants to the exchequer, Modi said, ""The low contribution of taxes may be due to the structure of our tax laws. Low or zero tax rate is given to certain types of financial income."" Securities transaction tax also features among the various levies in the financial markets. According to estimates, an investor pays around 15.3 per cent in taxes. 1. The Prime Minister's remarks assume much significance ahead of the budget to be presented in the first week of February. 2. ""Those who profit from the financial markets must make a fair contribution to nation-building through taxes. For various reasons, the contribution of tax from those who make money on the markets has been low. To some extent, it may be due to illegal activities and fraud,"" Modi said, without mentioning about any particular tax. 3. ""We should consider methods for increasing it in a fair, efficient and transparent way,"" added the Prime Minister, while inaugurating the new educational and training campus of the Sebi-run National Institute of Securities Markets in this industrial township near Mumbai. 4. Modi said tax rates can go up as every investor today gets equal tax treatment. 5. ""In the past, there was a feeling that some investors were getting an unfair deal by using certain tax treaties. As you know, those treaties have been amended by the government. Now, it is time to rethink and come up with a good design which is simple and transparent, but also fair and progressive."" 6. Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram had introduced the securities transaction tax (STT) in 2004. 7. When introduced, the rate was 0.125 per cent for a delivery stock and 0.025 per cent on intra-day transactions and 0.017 per cent on futures and options transactions, to stop tax avoidance of capital gains tax. 8. The 2013 budget reduced STT to 0.1 per cent on the turnover for delivery and also futures, while for equity options, it was cut to 0.05 per cent on sale premium. 9. Currently, the STT is charged at 0.1 per cent on all delivery trades in the cash market, and at 0.025 per cent on sell leg of all non-delivery trades in the cash market (equity shares and units of equity oriented funds).",business,2490,53,70

East Delhi to link Aadhaar with birth and death certificates,"To control the alleged fraudulence in issuing of birth and death certificates, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to link them with the Aadhaar numbers soon.EDMC commissioner Mohanjeet Singh has on Tuesday directed the Information Technology department to chalk out the plan for speedy implementation of the project.Officials say requisition has already been sent to a private company (Tech Mahindra) for collecting data and initiating work on linking death and birth certificates with Aadhaar number. The civic agency will ask the applicants to mention the Aadhaar number of parents of new born babies and the Unique Identity number (UID) of the deceased/his heirs in the birth and death certificates.?In Phase I, the civic agency will inquire the Aadhaar numbers of parents approaching us for their child?s birth certificate. Similarly the Aadhaar/UID number of deceased/parents of the deceased/ spouse (if the deceased is married) need to be filled with application for death certificate,? said a senior official from the public health department, EDMC.?In Phase 2, we will start approaching the people, who have already been issued the birth/death certificates, to provide us the Aadhaar number. However, the provision won?t be made compulsory for the time being,? he said further.According to the official, EDMC has already received reminders from the Government of India twice, which is why the work is going on a war footing. ?But no timeline has being fixed for accomplishing the data so far,? he said.The officials also admitted that linking of Aadhaar card will ensure prompt availability of birth and death certificates in the jurisdiction, as all information can be accessed in one go.The decision has also been taken in the backdrop of a series of incidents involving stealing/ illegal issuing of birth and death certificates in North and East Corporations that took place in the last two years.In November 2015, the EDMC?s website was hacked and 76 birth/death certificates were issued illegally. Similarly in May 2016, about 20,000 pre-printed (blank) birth/death certificates were stolen from one of the offices of the North Corporation. In both the cases, action were taken against the defaulting staff, but to avoid these incidents in future, the step would be taken.Prior to this, in July 2015, the CBI had also allegedly detected large number of irregularities in issuance of birth certificates by the North Corporation, during a surprise check. ?The initiative will help in avoiding duplicity as details of the person can be accessed with the help of one (Aadhaar) number,? said Yoginder Singh Mann, EDMC spokesperson.",general,2653,60,70

11-yr-old kills self after parents send him for IIT coaching,"An 11-year-old student committed suicide by jumping off the second floor of his school building in Karimnagar district of Telangana ostensibly after failing to cope with parental pressure to study IIT foundation course. Police said Gurram Srikar Reddy, a student of Class 7 at Siddhartha High School in Karimnagar town, took the extreme step on Thursday morning. ?Srikar, along with his classmates, went to his classroom in the second floor of the building. But within no time, he came out into the corridor and suddenly jumped from the floor, resulting in grievous injuries. He was immediately rushed to a local corporate hospital, where he was pronounced dead,? Karimnagar one-town inspector Srinivasa Rao said.Srikar was the only son of G Shashidhar Reddy and Sharada, from Gollapalli village of Dharmaram block of neighbouring Peddapalli district. They said they wanted to give their son the best education. Reddy, a farmer, told the police that he had admitted his son into the IIT foundation course being offered by the school with a hope that the boy would become a top engineer.?However, Srikar was not showing interest in studies and was mentally disturbed. But we never expected that he would commit suicide,? Reddy said.Initially, the parents attributed Srikar?s suicide to the negligence of the school management. But later changed their version in the complaint lodged with the police stating that their son was mentally disturbed.However, students unions in Karimnagar town staged a dharna in front of the government hospital, where the body was shifted for post mortem, and demanded action against the school management.This is the second such incident in Telangana this week.

"Go, meet voters: Amit Shah to Delhi BJP leaders","If the Delhi BJP leaders thought they enjoyed the pleasure of the central leadership after the emphatic victory in MCD elections, an utterly rude shock awaited them.Upset with the lax attitude of Delhi BJP leaders and bickering within the state party unit, the party's national president Amit Shah on Friday took them to task and noted that the party leaders spent more time meeting the top leaders than reaching out to the common people.In a meeting with Delhi BJP office bearers on day one of his Delhi pravaas, Shah also set a target of securing 51 per cent votes in the next assembly polls. He expressed displeasure over the state of affairs in Delhi unit after several leaders came out in open alleging the current leadership has failed to follow the policies of the party and that favourites of Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari got the key posts.The BJP president was meeting Delhi BJP leaders at the NDMC convention centre in the national Capital. The meetings would continue on Saturday at Delhi BJP headquarters. This is the first ever brainstorming session of Amit Shah with Delhi BJP leaders.""A majority of leaders in Delhi are not working hard enough. All they are doing is making efforts to meet and please Amit Shah, Ramlal and Arun Jaitley. No one is spending time to meet the common people,"" Shah was quoted as saying by a BJP leader who was present in the meeting.Sources said he was also unhappy with the haphazardly executed vistarak program in Delhi. According to Delhi BJP, only 60 per cent of over 13,000 booths in Delhi were covered. Also the party was far behind the target of adding 1.5 lakh new members to the party.Even after a BJP leader present in the meeting told Shah that the party would get 41 per cent votes in a triangular fight in Delhi if elections were held immediately, Shah - who had a target of 51 per cent in Delhi- was not convinced. The leaders gave a detailed presentation on the voting pattern, caste equations and demographic division in the Capital and also the factors that led to BJP's successive defeats in elections. Shah also directed the state leadership to improve its presence at the booth level to strike good rapport with the voters.During the meeting, some among the party leaders also cited lack of coordination between office bearers and the subordinates. Taking strong note of this, Shah directed Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Chahal to put before him all communication sent from the central office ever since he became the BJP president in August 2014.He also took note of the complaints that the communications from central leadership was not circulated to party workers at the district and block levels.An action report has been sought regarding all communications on Saturday.",general,2748,47,70
World Bank cuts India's growth forecast to 7% post note ban,"The World Bank has downgraded the Indian economy?s growth forecast as sharp falls in the country?s automobile and real estate sales flagged the short-term impact of recalling India?s two most-used bank notes. The Washington-based financial institution predicted India?s economy would grow by a ?still robust? 7% in the fiscal year to March 2017 ? a 0.6% drop from its earlier forecast but still the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.It attributes the fall to November?s decision to recall all 1,000 and 500 rupee currency bills from circulation, a surprise demonetisation move intended to weed out untaxed wealth, hasten the digitisation of India?s economy and disrupt terrorist and other criminal networks. ?Continued tailwinds from low oil prices and solid agricultural output [were] partly offset by challenges associated with the withdrawal of a large volume of currency in circulation and subsequent replacement with new notes,? the World Bank said on Wednesday.Demonetisation has suffocated the vast informal economy, which employs up to 80% of Indians, but the World Bank said the impact of the policy was likely to be short term. ?India is expected to regain its momentum, with growth rising to 7.6% in fiscal year 2018-19 and strengthening to 7.8% in fiscal year 2019-20,? the bank said.Automobile industry data also released on Wednesday showed the largest fall in sales in 16 years. Nearly 300,000 fewer vehicle were purchased last month than in December 2015, a drop of 19%, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.Sales of two-wheelers ? which require less paperwork to buy and are more popular in rural areas, so are more likely to be bought in cash ? fell by 22%, the steepest rate since Siam began collecting data in 1997.Property sales also came to a complete standstill, according to a report by property consultants Knight Frank India. Sales fell by 44% across eight major Indian cities between October and December 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, the report said.Delhi was particularly badly hit, with sales in the capital slumping by more than 50%, and 73% fewer new residential developments being launched than in the last quarter of 2015. ?The effect of demonetisation on all segments of the real estate sector across all markets has been fairly brutal to say the least,? said Shishir Baijal, the chairman of Knight Frank India.Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat summit on Wednesday, the Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, continued to defend demonetisation, linking the policy to the goods and services tax the government is aiming to introduce in April. ?The combination of a more digitised economy with a more efficient tax system ... will make our economy look much cleaner and bigger,? he said.Jaitley said the rupee recall was ?a major step toward integration of [the] informal economy with the more formal economy?. He said: ?This itself is going to increase the transactions which are covered within the banking system, transactions which may lead to higher [tax] revenue in the future.?",world,3065,59,70

"Airtel, Idea, Vodafone to be probed for blocking Jio's entry","New Delhi, May 11 (PTI) The Competition Commission has ordered a detailed probe against major telecom players for allegedly trying to block the entry of newcomer Reliance Jio, according to sources. The fair trade regulators decision comes on a complaint filed against leading incumbent players -- Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular -- and industry body COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India). A senior official said the regulator has decided to investigate allegations of unfair business practices made against the incumbent telecom players. Sources said the regulator would also examine the overall conduct of the COAI, especially since the allegations of anti- competitive practices have been made against three of its key members. The probe by the Director General (DG) has been ordered for allegedly trying to restrict the entry of Reliance Jio, the official added. DG is the investigation arm of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Cases where the watchdog finds prima-facie evidence of competition norms violations are referred to the DG for detailed probe. When contacted for comments on the CCI ordering the probe, an Airtel spokesperson said, ""We have not received any such communication from the CCI and would, therefore, not be able to comment."" ""We have already stated that we have always responded with alacrity and provided a staggering quantum of PoIs (Point of Interconnections) to Reliance Jio in record time,"" the spokesperson added. Emails sent to Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Jio did not elicit any response. ""Though we have not seen the order as it has not been published yet, we are disappointed at the apparent news (if confirmed), that the CCI has decided to go forward with an investigation into the complaint filed by Reliance Jio,"" COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said. ""We believe the COAI and its members will be fully vindicated in the matter and truth will prevail,"" he said. Last year, billionaire Mukesh Ambanis venture Reliance Jio stormed into the Indian telecom market - the second largest market globally with 1.2 billion subscribers - with disruptive offerings and has since been at loggerheads with the incumbent operators. Reliance Jio had accused incumbent players of not providing sufficient network connectivity (leading to call failures on its network) while the latter countered the claims saying the newcomer was unleashing ""tsunami"" of free traffic from its mobile network. The two sides have also clashed on other contentious issues like free voice and data offers, and customised retention plans.",business,2580,60,70

Fake 'CBI' men steal jewellery worth ?20L in Delhi,"It started like any other day at jeweller Nawal Kishore Khandelwal?s home in central Delhi?s Karol Bagh; he and his two sons left for their shop in Chandni Chowk, the women worked through morning chores and as they settled in for the afternoon, a man in khaki and five masked men rang the bell. ?My wife opened the door and the man identified himself as a CBI official. Five more men who were with him told her that they had come to raid the house. Before my wife could understand anything, the men pushed her inside,? said Khandelwal.For the next 10 minutes ? shortly after 1.30pm ? the suspects held a gun to Khandelawal?s four-year-old grandson Divyansh as they rummaged through the house before escaping with gold and diamond jewellery worth around Rs 20 lakh. The police said the incident, which took place on Wednesday, was the first time robbers had posed as police officers to carry out an armed robbery in a home in the middle of the day.Mandeep Singh Randhawa, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said a case of robbery and theft has been registered but the suspects are yet to be identified. ?One of them put a pistol to Divyansh?s head and threatened to kill him if anybody screamed for help or raised an alarm,? said the 61-year-old jewellery Besides Khandelwal?s wife Urmila and the child, the robbers held his daughter-in-law Megha hostage. One of the men took the keys to a locker from Megha and he ransacked the locker. The hold-up would have likely lasted longer had Khandelwal?s other daughter-in-law, Preeti, not spotted it and raised an alarm. Her scream?s led the men to flee, Khandlewal said, adding that they did not touch the cash and other jewellery in the house. The attack had left Urmila, 58, with a fracture in the left shoulder and Megha with a broken right foot.Three teams have been formed to investigate the case. The teams are collecting details about criminals who operate using similar methods, and are poring over electronic surveillance and human intelligence networks.

Iranian women spark debate by not wearing hijab in cars,"A growing number of women in Iran are refusing to wear a hijab while driving, sparking a nationwide debate about whether a car is a private space where they can dress more freely.Obligatory wearing of the hijab has been an integral policy of the Islamic republic since the 1979 revolution but it is one the establishment has had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. Many Iranian women are already pushing the boundaries, and observers in Tehran say women who drive with their headscarves resting on their shoulders are becoming a familiar sight.Clashes between women and Iran?s morality police particularly increase in the summer when temperatures rise. But even though the police regularly stop these drivers, fining them or even temporarily seizing their vehicle, such acts of resistance have continued, infuriating hardliners over a long-standing policy they have had a great deal of difficulty enforcing. Iran?s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, has argued that people?s private space should be respected and opposes a crackdown on women who don?t wear the hijab. He said explicitly that the police?s job is not to administer Islam. Speaking in 2015, Rouhani said: ?The police can?t do something and say I?m doing this because God said so. That?s not a police [officer]?s business.?Many in Iran believe that private space includes the inside of a car, but judicial authorities and the police have opposed that interpretation. ?The invisible part of the car, such as the trunk, is a private space, but this does not apply to the visible parts of the car,? Hadi Sadeghi, the deputy head of Iran?s judiciary chief, said last week. His comments have prompted widespread reaction online, with one user posting a satirical picture showing a couple embracing in a car boot. Another user tweeted: ?The police have said that only the boot is a private space... poor those of us who have a hatchback car [without a boot]... we don?t have any private space.? Local media often refrain from directly criticising the mandatory hijab, but the debate over what constitutes a private space has allowed newspapers and even state news agencies to publish articles reflecting views from both sides. ?Private or not private?? asked an article carried by the state Irna news agency on Monday. ?This is a question that has created a legal and religious discussion about private space within cars.? Hossein Ahmadiniaz, a lawyer, told Irna that infringing on people?s private spaces was like infringing their citizen?s rights, arguing that it was up to parliamentarians to define the private space and not the police. ?The law says that the space within a car is a private space,? he said. ?The government?s citizen?s rights charter [launched by Rouhani] also considers a car to be a private space and it is incumbent upon enforcers to respect that.?Bahman Keshavarz, a leading lawyer, wrote an article in the reformist Shargh daily, arguing that wearing a so-called ?bad hijab? (loose hijab) is not a crime under Iranian law. Saeid Montazeralmahdi, a spokesperson for the Iranian police, disagreed. ?What is visible to the public eye is not private space and norms and the rules should be respected within cars.? He also warned car owners against using tinted glass to prevent onlookers from seeing into the car. The debate is not only among liberal Iranians. Abolfazl Najafi Tehrani, a cleric based in Tehran, tweeted: ?People?s cars, like people?s houses, are their property and a private space and infringing upon this space will disturb people?s moral security and will harm women?s trust with the police.?Yahya Kamalpour, a member of the Iranian parliament, said: ?The space within people?s cars is a private space and the police has no right to enter that space without a judicial order.?The debate comes amid a growing rift between the government and the hardline judiciary that acts independently of Rouhani?s government. Despite restrictions, women are increasingly active in Iranian society. It emerged on Sunday that Iran Air, the country?s national airline, has for the first time appointed a female CEO. Rouhani is also under pressure from his voter base to nominate a record number of female ministers in his cabinet reshuffle next month. In a sign of slowly changing attitudes, Ali Karimi, a veteran Iranian footballer, on Monday called on the authorities to allow female fans to attend stadiums alongside men.",world,4410,55,70
"3,000-year-old copper mask found in Argentina","Washington, Jun 7 (PTI) Scientists have discovered a 3,000-year-old rectangular copper mask in Argentina - one of the oldest human-made metal object from South America. The mask, that dates back to about 1000 BC, was found at a site where adults and children were buried. Holes mark the position of the masks eyes, nose and mouth, with additional small, circular openings near the edges that could have been threaded to secure it to a face or an object. Scientists from University of Buenos Aires in Argentina also found a source of copper ore within 70 kilometres of the location where the mask was uncovered, suggesting that it was produced locally. It is probable that metalworking emerged in Argentina at the same time that it was developing in Peru, the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Antiquity. The metal mask - along with a collection of human bones ? was found in a tomb near a village in northwestern Argentina. There were about 14 bodies in the burial area, with the bones all mixed together and the mask placed on top of one corner of the pile.",general,1081,45,70

"CBSE planning 10, 12 exams on same dates in different shifts","The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) proposes to hold the finals for classes 10 and 12 on same dates in two shifts, a move that will reduce the examination period and give teachers extra time to check answer-scripts more thoroughly.The new plan was designed after the board met principals of some of the top schools in New Delhi and its satellite cities. The CBSE, which has two panels committees to suggest ways to improve the system, will review the suggestions before a final decision is taken.The country?s largest school board that has more than 18,000 institutions affiliated to it holds the two exams usually from March 1, barring exceptions such as this year?s state assembly elections that delayed the test by more than a week. The exams run close to 45 days because of an array of subjects and separate time-tables for the two classes.The plan to set common dates for both exams, with Class 12 in the morning and Class 10 in the afternoon, is likely to decrease the overall duration of the finals.At present, exams are not held in the afternoon.The reduced number of exam days will give evaluators ? a pool of schoolteachers selected by the CBSE ? more time to check the answer-scripts of students before the results are declared in May.The teachers usually get a small window to check the answers, given the sheer size of the number of examinees. More than a million students wrote the Class 12 exam this year. ?By conducting Class 12 and 10 exams on the same day we can reduce the examination period and provide more time to the evaluators,? a senior board official said.The CBSE has drawn criticism for its evaluation system as several students complained of variation in marks after asking the board for a relook.The board said it took extra care to cut faults, but the possibility of human error cannot be ruled out in calculating the marks, putting them on answer-scripts and feeding them manually in computers.?Efforts are made to further improve the system,? the official said. The meeting with principals was called to gather views ?before deciding anything on the evaluation and examination system?, the official said.According to sources, most principals were against reevaluation or rechecking of answer-scripts, but won?t mind verification of marks.?A longer evaluation period will be better for students. This will give teachers more time to look at the answer sheets, maybe more teachers can look at them. This will ensure fewer errors,? a principal said.Another principal said ?we have assured the board we will send our best teachers? to check answers.It has also been suggested that the board should ask students to suggest teachers who could be good evaluators. Another suggestion is to increase the remuneration of evaluators, at least by 20%, and to set a figure as to how many copies they need to check.?We are looking at restricting the number of copies that can be evaluated by a person in six hours so that quality is maintained,? the CBSE official said.(Inputs from A Mariyam Alavi in New Delhi)",general,3042,60,70
Nutella maker wins case against rival's false health claims,"A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free ?Choco? spread were illegal, in a case brought against the supermarket chain Delhaize by Ferrero, which manufactures Nutella.Delhaize has been ordered not to repeat any claims about its Choco spread being better for the planet or your health, on pain of a ?25,000 (£22,000) fine for each repetition.Ferrero argued that the Delhaize campaign unfairly damaged its iconic Nutella brand, which was placed next to the Choco spread on the supermarket?s shelves.Delhaize, which had won an earlier court case on the issue, told the Guardian it was considering further legal actions but would not appeal the verdict.At issue is a short-lived Delhaize advertising campaign in 2013, which claimed that the Belgian outlet?s best-selling Choco spread was better for the planet and for consumer health because it contained no palm oil. Ferrero argued this implied that firms which used sustainable practices for buying palm oil within existing supply chains were ethically inferior.Greenpeace, which in 2015 rated (pdf) Ferrero one of the best of 14 global manufacturers with ?no deforestation? policies, said the case had turned into a battle of sales strategies.?Ferrero is definitely one of the companies doing its best to implement sustainable commitments,? said An Lambrechts, a Greenpeace Belgium spokeswoman. ?This case is more about marketing ploys and market shares and less about who has the best initiative on palm oil.?Ferrero?s use of palm oil was pushed into the spotlight in 2015 after then-French environment minister Ségolène Royal called for a consumer boycott of Nutella over deforestation concerns. Royal subsequently backed down from the call, offering the confectionery titan ?a thousand apologies?.Multiple studies (pdf) have drawn causal links between the growth of palm oil plantations in south-east Asia and deforestation but the court ruled that Delhaize?s claims were unverifiable.Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year. It is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Palm Oil Innovation Group.?The court sustained Ferrero?s arguments that it is illegal to claim that a product without palm oil is de facto better for environment and has better nutritional qualities than one containing palm oil,? a spokesman for Ferrero said.?Ferrero has taken admirable steps to reduce the impact of palm oil within its supply chain,? said Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of Mighty, which campaigns against deforestation caused by palm oil. ?But it is as yet impossible to delink one company?s supplies from the broader, continued deforestation of the palm oil industry as a whole.?A separate argument by Ferrero that Delhaize not be allowed to call their spread ?Choco? ? because it contains no chocolate ? was thrown out by the court.For its part, Delhaize said Choco was still being manufactured with sunflower oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil ? and packaged as palm oil-free.?We have not seen any impact on [Choco] sales. On the contrary,? said the firm?s communications director Roel Dekelver. ?Despite this judgement, we will continue to propose and present innovative and inspirational products to customers that answer their different needs. This won?t hold us back.? The Belgian supermarket, which merged with Ahold to create a ?40bn retail empire last year, had also alleged health benefits from palm-oil free produce, citing ?potential health concerns? from palm oil in an assessment by the European Food Safety Authority.However, this assessment also applied to other vegetable oils and products, and the analysis is currently being reassessed. Ian Barber, the communications director of the Advertising Association, said that the first rule of advertising was: ?If you can?t back up the claim, you can?t make it?. ?I?d imagine the strategy open to Delhaize now is just to advertise that they?re palm oil-free and leave world to make up its mind if that?s a good or a bad thing,? he said.

The mechanical sweepers were introduced as manual sweeping by brooms blow more dust particles in air than it cleans off the ground. Data from Central Pollution Control Board shows that after a lull of five years post 2010, the level of particulate matter in Delhi?s air has shot up. Microscopic particles, PM10 and PM2.5, are responsible for dangerous pulmonary and cardiac problems.At present the dust collected is mostly taken to the landfill sites and dumped. When the wind blows these particles return to the city rendering the entire sweeping process ineffective.?Even a light wind would be able to raise a dust storm if the dumped dust is not dampened with water or have a green cover over it. The plan that is being formulated have taken into consideration all these factors,? said an official of the state environment department. Earlier in June, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, during a meeting to review the status of measures taken by various agencies to combat air pollution in Delhi had directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to come up with a standard operating procedure to come up with a disposal plan.?We have already drawn up a draft plan for the proper disposal of the road dust that is collected by the mechanical sweepers.

"Our bowling is something else, Riteish Deshmukh on India win","Spinner Ekta Bisht wreaked havoc as India thrashed arch-rival Pakistan by 95 runs in their ICC Women's World Cup encounter at Derby on Sunday. Defending a lowly target of 170 runs, the Indian eves were spectacular with the ball as they didn't allow their arch-rival to claim a historic win and bowled out Pakistan for just 74 runs in 38.1 overs. Ekta started casting her magic from the very start and was absolutely lethal, giving nothing away and picking wickets right from the beginning. Captain Sana Mir was the lone Pakistan batter who fought soulfully till the very end. However, her 29 runs off 73 balls couldn't help her team register their first win of the tournament. Ekta was the pick of the Indian bowlers as she picked up five wickets for just 18 runs in her allotted 10 overs. She was well supported by Mansi Joshi (2/9), Jhulan Goswami (1/12), Deepti Sharma (1/21) and Harmanpreet Kaur (1/6). Earlier, the Mithali Raj-led side was done by some fine bowling performance by Pakistan as they registered their lowest total of the tournament.

Sasikala?s husband alleges BJP trying to destabilise TN govt,"Thanjavur, Jan 16 (PTI) M Natarajan, husband of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, tonight accused ""some sections"" in the BJP of trying to split the AIADMK and get the state government dismissed. ""They are trying to break the AIADMK and dismiss our government. They are trying to besmirch our government. There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""We will not allow such conspiracies to succeed...I will face the challenge squarely...I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he said while addressing the valedictory session of the three-day Thamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Pongal Thiruvizha (Tamil art and literary Pongal festival) here. The remarks of Natarajan are significant because he is said to wield considerable influence in the AIADMK, particularly after the demise of J Jayalalithaa, and his allegation against the BJP comes against the souring relations between the two parties. Later when asked by reporters about the attempts to divide the party and dismiss the government, Natarajan said definitely attempts were on at the behest of S Gurumurthy, the RSS ideologue. Significantly, Gurumurthy, who has taken over as Editor of Thuglaq magazine after the demise of founder-editor Cho S Ramaswamy, had made veiled remarks at the annual readers interaction on Saturday in Chennai that while one party was already under the control of a family (apparent reference to DMK), another party was going into the control of a family (AIADMK). Natarajan dared Gurumurthy to come out ""in the open"" and oppose them and ""not hide behind"". He also questioned the security being given to Gurumurthy who held no position in the government. He said while they support Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there were others who were creating problem for the AIADMK. Natarajan said when powerful forces were acting against Jayalalithaa after MGRs death, it was he and his family who had protected her like a shield. ""There were just four or five of us who protected her...for 36 years since then, my wife Sasikala was bearing her on her shoulders,"" Natarajan said delving on the hard sacrifices that he and his family had made to protect Jayalalithaa and thereby preserve the AIADMK from the designs of the rival DMK. He said unnecessary controversies and questions were being raised over Jayalalithaas treatment in the hospital. Her entire treatment has been recorded. She was with a clear mind while in the hospital, he claimed. Complimenting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam of giving able administration, Natarajan said it was his personal opinion that he should continue as CM.",general,2692,60,70

"Kangana, Shahid, Saif starrer 'Rangoon' hits the theatres","Rangoon is a triangular love story set in the backdrop of World War II. Here is our Rangoon movie review.Rangoon Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali KhanRangoon Direction: Vishal BhardwajRangoon Rating: (3.5/5)When Rusi Bilmoria (Saif Ali Khan), an ex-film star who has been just a producer since an on-set accident, finds out that his fiance, the love of his life Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), also the top star of his company, has cheated on him with a soldier, Jamadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), he turns his head silently towards his woman and looks at her with eyes red with grief, shock and the rage of a thousand suns.If you thought Saif Ali Khan's best moment in the movies till date was the scene in Omkara where he, Langda Tyagi, looks and keeps looking at Ajay Devgn in disbelief when Omkara (Ajay Devgn) makes Kesu (Vivek Oberoi) his political successor; well, stop right there. Saif has outdone his Omkara moment with the aforementioned scene from Rangoon. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.That and the beautiful, almost feral chemistry between the loyal soldier of the British Indian Army, Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), and '40s queen of the Indian big screen Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut).ALSO SEE: Before Rangoon's Julia, meet the original 'Hunterwali'Rangoon is a triangular love story between Nawab, Julia and Rusi. The story begins in 1943 in India when the British Army requests Rusi Bilmoria to send his beloved, Miss Julia, to the Indo-Burma border so that she can entertain the nation's soldiers. Rusi, a nation-lover, does his duty and sends off Julia with his troupe plus Nawab Malik as Julia's personal security. When the Japanese bomb them on their way, Malik and Julia manage to escape into Burma and, well, love blooms.Vishal Bhardwaj's most expensive and, of late, his most accessible film Rangoon sails smoothly as long its hero and heroine are allowed to just be. Malik and Julia's romance is slow-cooked and the essence of every moment between the two is allowed to linger before the next moment starts. It feels like Nawab Malik and Julia are floating in their own dreamland, perfectly content with the scheme of things, and consequently, Rangoon appears to feel content with itself, devoid of any duties to formal narrative storytelling. There is no rush to fast-forward to the next plot device in this entire stretch where Malik and Julia's romance is built up.Watch Yeh Ishq Hai from Rangoon here:Therefore, in the second half, when Vishal Bhardwaj and Co. pull up their socks to tie all the loose ends and ensure that all three protagonists - Malik, Julia and Rusi - find poetic justice, regardless of how laborious that pursuit might look on screen, Rangoon slowly, slowly bends and breaks its back under the pressure of Vishal Bhardwaj's narrative ambitions.ALSO SEE: Will Rangoon prove to be another Queen for Kangana Ranaut?Rangoon is gorgeous-looking with great cinematography (Pankaj Kumar, take a bow), fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography (Farah Khan, Sudesh Adhana). Love-making in the mud has never looked (and probably, never will) this sexy in a mainstream Hindi film. All that is fine. Where Rangoon does a bloody fail is its attempt to see through its two parallel narrative strands finding a common end: one, the love story, and the other, the war-conspiracy backdrop with the British Indian Army and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA mixed up.Vishal Bhardwaj, caught with the duty to serve two movies in one (an old-school romance and a war thriller), doesn't really do a Casablanca though he does give Rangoon his best shot. Nevertheless, Rangoon comes off as probably 2017's most good-looking and well-made Indian film. Certainly, this year's most ambitious, with three great lead performances. Vishal Bhardwaj is in fine form, mostly. And yes, the National Anthem comes thrice in the film.

2 officers held in Mumbai for helping illegal immigration,"The Mumbai Police arrested two senior officers posted at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport for allegedly letting people pass through immigration without due process. The officers - identified as Anil Surse (35) and Harshal Patil (33) - were arrested after a major case of illegal transportation of humans was busted last month. Mumbai Police's Sahar unit made the arrest. According to police officials, they uncovered the racket after arresting a woman who was travelling to Vancouver, Canada under a fake name and passport. During interrogation, the woman provided information on the racket and named three men believed to be the masterminds.

Maharashtra govt doubles pay for corporators,"The Maharashtra government has hiked the monthly honorarium of elected representatives to municipal bodies in the state, including the Mumbai civic body ? Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) ? by double and more than double in some cases. The government has for the first time decided to determine honorarium for the corporators based on the category of the civic bodies. For Mumbai, the honorarium of a corporator has been hiked from Rs10,000 to Rs 25,000 ? a rise of 150%.The decision was taken considering inflation and demands made at a conference held in Mumbai last year.According to a government resolution by the state urban development department (UDD), a monthly honorarium given to the corporators will now be based on the class of the civic body. In Maharashtra, municipal corporations are divided in to five categories ? A+, A, B, C, and D on the basis of their population and per capita income. The BMC is the only municipal body that comes under A+ category.With the decision, corporators of A+ municipal corporation will now get a honorarium of Rs25,000 a month. For A class civic bodies, corporators will get an honorarium of 20,000 (166% rise), B class ? Rs15,000 (100% rise), while C and D class honorarium for corporators will be Rs10,000 a month (33% rise).Except Mumbai, all the other corporators from rest of the municipal bodies were getting Rs7,500 a month as honorarium from 2010. It included phone, bills, stationery and postage. In 2008, the honorarium for Mumbai corporators was hiked to Rs10,000 a month, said a senior official from the urban development department. A resolution for rise in the monthly honorarium of the corporators was passed at the Mayor Conference held in Mumbai on June 29, 2016, suggesting Rs 25,000 for Mayor, Rs 20,000 for deputy mayor and Rs15,000 for corporators across the state. The resolution was sent to the state government for consideration. Instead, the government decided to determine honorarium of the corporators based on their categories. Other than this, a Mumbai corporator gets Rs150 for attending each sitting of the civic house (not more than Rs600 per month) and for corporators from other civic bodies ,it is Rs 100 (not more than Rs 400 per month).",politics,2229,44,70

"Graves on the rise, but no land to live: Delhi HC","New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) The way graveyards are expanding in the national capital, there would be no place to live, the Delhi High Court observed today. Asking the authorities to find out about the burial practices prevailing elsewhere in the world, a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said as the population was rising, the death rate was also growing, but the land remained the same. ""The way you are expanding graves, there will be no place to live. There is no place for people to live. There is space only for graves. Please help the city to live. Where will you bury people who die now? Find out what is the practice in the world,"" the bench said. It also said that several illegal activities were also going on in the graveyards.

Airport reopens after three-year closure during Libyan war,"Benghazi?s international airport officially reopened for commercial flights amid a heavy security presence on Saturday after a three-year closure due to fighting in the city.The first outward bound flights from Benina Airport were to the capital, Tripoli, to Amman, Jordan, and to the south-eastern Libyan city of Kufra. Flights are also scheduled to and from Tunis, Istanbul, Alexandria, and the western Libyan city of Zintan. The flights are operated by two state-owned companies, Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways. Benina is just east of Benghazi, Libya?s second city, where fighting escalated in the summer of 2014 when forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched a military campaign against Islamists and other opponents.Earlier this month, Haftar declared victory in the campaign as his forces battled rivals in their last downtown holdouts. Travellers and airport staff expressed relief at no longer having to travel to Labraq airport, a four-hour drive east of Benghazi, which had replaced Benina as the main airport for the eastern part of the country. In recent months, some official and cargo flights had already been flying from Benina. There is also a military airport at Benina, which continued operating throughout the conflict as Haftar?s forces targeted their rivals with air strikes. Tripoli?s international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014, and flights have since operated out of the smaller Mitiga airport near the centre of the capital.

Do you think you have the liberty to say whatever you want?"" the NGT bench asked, setting the next date of hearing to May 9.Responding to the statement of NGT, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has said that Art Of Living has done no wrong. ""The truth is we have caused no damage to the Yamuna. When lies are exposed, it is shocking,"" he said.The tribunal also directed Art of Living and other parties to file their replies and objections to the expert panel's report. THE REPORTAn expert committee recently told the National Green Tribunal that it would cost Rs. 13.29 crore and take around 10 years to mitigate the damage caused to the Yamuna floodplains by AOL's event last year. The expert committee was headed by Shashi Shekhar, the Union secretary water resources. ""It has been estimated that approximately 120 hectares (about 300 acres) of floodplains of west (right bank) of the river Yamuna and about 50 hectares (120 acres) floodplains of the eastern side (left bank) of the river have been adversely impacted ecologically at different magnitudes,"" the report had said. ""The ground is now totally levelled, compacted and hardened and is totally devoid of water bodies or depressions and almost completely devoid of any vegetation,"" the 47-page report also said.""The area where the grand stage was erected (and the area immediately behind it) is heavily consolidated - most likely with a different kind of external material used to level the ground and compress it,"" the committee added.'UNSCIENTIFIC AND BIASED' Responding to the report, Art of Living said, ""This report is completely flawed, unscientific and biased"". ""We have placed significant material on record before the NGT (National Green Tribunal) which clearly shows the committee is biased. Our application in this regard has not yet been heard,"" Sri Sri Ravi Shankar was quoted as saying in a statement by news agency IANS. ""From randomly pronouncing damages for Rs 120 crore, they have come down to Rs 13 crore; from permanent damage, they are now saying 10 years. From damage to wetlands, they are now saying damage to floodplains. Their inconsistencies expose their lies,"" the statement further added.",general,2663,57,70

Mob sets police station on fire after accused killed in jail,"An accused in the murder and gangrape of a 16-year-old girl in Himachal Pradesh?s Kotkhai died in police custody early Wednesday, triggering violent clashes across the state that saw a mob burn down a police station and pelt stones at security personnel.The accused, Nepalese national Surat Singh, was allegedly strangled by another suspect, Rajendra Singh, during a scuffle inside the lock-up around 3am on Wednesday, police said. News of his death sent ripples of anger through the Himalayan state as people shouted slogans, clashed with police and blocked arterial roads, demanding an overhaul of what protesters deem a shoddy probe.Shimla superintendent of police DW Negi said a fight broke out between Rajendra and Surat around midnight inside the lock up. ?Surat was rushed to hospital where he was declared brought dead,? said Negi.Violence in kothkai, shimla, after an accused in rape and murder of a minor died in police custody pic.twitter.com/BkDez8PHM1? Chetan Chauhan (@chetanecostani) July 19, 2017The gangrape of the minor girl has rocked the poll-bound state where such crimes are uncommon. The girl, a Class 10 student, went missing on her way home from school on July 4 and her naked body was found two days later with injury marks. Since then, her photos have gone viral on social media as hundreds of people have come out on the streets to protest in candlelight marches, silent processions and road blockades. The state government also bowed to increasing public pressure and transferred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation.The entire staff of Kotkhai police station, including the station house inspector, were suspended following the custodial death. Sources said the SHO kept all the six accused in two cells instead of keeping them in separate enclosures.Surat Singh?s death sparked protests across the state as Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad members took out a rally in central Shimla. There were long traffic jams in the upper regions of Himachal Pradesh as people blocked the highway from Shimla to Kotkhai. The epicentre of the incident ? Kotkhai, around 60 kilometres from Shimla ? resembled a war zone. In the afternoon, a violent mob of around 3,000 surrounded the police station, set it on fire and injured several personnel. The police fired in the air to disperse the crowd but failed as protesters surrounded the living quarters of personnel.Unrest over the case has been simmering since the police claimed a breakthrough on July 13, and arrested six people: Ashish Chauhan (29), Rajinder Singh (32) of Sharaal village, Subash Singh Bisht (42) of Pauri Garhwal, Surat Singh (29) of Nepal, Lok Jan (19) of Nepal and Deepak (38) of Garhwal. They were produced before a court in Theog and sent to seven-day police remand.The police alleged that Rajendra Singh offered her a lift to her village Shirguli, nearly five kilometers from the school. Rajendra was not alone and was accompanied by four-five friends who were drunk. The occupants of the vehicle pulled her out and raped her, police said.Shimla: Villagers pelt stones&protest outside Kotkhai Police Station after 1 of the 6 accused in gang rape & murder of minor,died in custody pic.twitter.com/aE8dWOWSgE?

Hafiz Saeed spreading terrorism in name of jihad: Pakistan,"Mumbai terror attack mastermind and Jamat-ud Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed and his four aides have been detained for ""spreading terrorism in the name of jihad"", Pakistan's interior ministry has told a judicial review board.Saeed appeared before the board on Saturday and told it that he had been detained by the Pakistani government in order to stop him for raising voice for Kashmiris.However, the interior ministry rejected his arguments and told the three-member board that Saeed and his four aides have been detained for ""spreading terrorism in the name of jihad"".The board comprising Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan of the Supreme Court (head), Justice Ayesha A Malik of Lahore High Court and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of Balochistan High Court directed the ministry to submit a complete record regarding detention of Saeed and his aides - Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rehman Abid, Abdullah Ubaid and Qazi Kashif Niaz on next hearing on May 15.HAFIZ SAEED PRODUCED BEFORE BOARDThe board also sought personal appearance of the attorney general of Pakistan on next hearing.Police produced Saeed and his four aides before the board at Lahore registry of the apex court amid high security.

My organisation and I have been victimised for raising voice for freedom of Kashmir and criticising the government s weak policy on the Kashmir issue,"" Saeed said.He said that he had been placed under house in order to stop him for raising voice for Kashmiri people.Saeed appealed to the board to set aside the Punjab government's detention order.""The government detained the JuD leaders on pressure of United Nations and international organisations,"" an official representing the federal interior ministry told the board.Last Thursday, Lahore High Court division bench had questioned as why Saeed and others were not presented before a review board before the government issued notification for extension to his detention for another 90 days.THE EXTENSION OF HAFIZ SAEED'S DETENTIONOn April 30, detention of Saeed and his four aides was extended by the Punjab government for another 90 days under preventative detention under 11 EEE (I) and 11D of Anti- Terrorism Act 1997.The Punjab government on January 30 had put these five under house arrest in Lahore for their involvement in activities which can be prejudicial to peace and security.The government has also placed JuD and FIF under second schedule of the anti-terrorism act.US SANCTIONS JAMAT-UD-DAWAHThe Nawaz government had reportedly taken action against Saeed after the US clearly told Islamabad that in case of not taking action against JuD and Saeed it may face sanctions.JuD is said to be the front for the banned Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT).

"No govt pressure to censor cow, Gujarat in Sen film: Pahlaj","There has been an intellectual uproar over the cuts ordered by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in Suman Ghosh?s documentary?The Argumentative Indian. Talking to us exclusively on these cuts, CBFC chairperson, Pahlaj Nihalani argues that the mere deletion or beeping of six words is no reason to feel creatively smothered when those words indicate a clear contempt for Indian culture and democracy.Says Nihalani, ?I have been flooded with calls from print and television channels asking why we?ve beeped six words in the documentary. For the first and last time, here?s the reason why. Because we felt a documentary on an Indian Nobel laureate, referring so insensitively to our politics and religion, could result in a serious breach in the peace and harmony of the country.?He adds, ?At one point, Prof Sen talks of Indian democracy and refers to Gujarat?s criminalities. We?ve asked for ?Gujarat? to be removed. At another point in the documentary, there is a reference to the enemy in India being religious leadership.We?ve asked for ?India? to be removed here.The third word we?ve ordered cut is when Prof Sen speaks of India being interpreted as ?Hindu?. We?ve asked for Hindu to be removed. The fourth cut is that of the word ?cow? where Prof Sen, while speaking of religious integration, makes a frivolous reference to the ?cow?. The fifth and according to us minor change is in Prof Sen?s line about the Vedas being used in a sectarian way these days. We?ve asked for the words ?used? and ?these days? to be removed. And finally Prof Sen refers to the Hindutva view of India as ?banal?. We asked for the offensive adjective to be removed.?Nihalani feels that the six words being removed from the documentary is wrongly being seen as pro-government chamchagiri. ?We are not asking for the removal of the words under pressure from the Government. We seriously feel the removal of the words causes no injury to Prof Sen?s thought processes in the documentary. On the other hand, referring to a cow in a flippant manner or calling Hindutva ?banal? could seriously breach the communal harmony of the country.?Nihalani opines that when filmmakers talk about freedom of expression, they should be aware of the responsibility that comes along with that freedom. ?You may be a Nobel laureate. But if you speak disparagingly about things held sacred by the population, you are vulnerable to attacks.?Nihalani wants the documentary?s director Suman Ghosh to calm down. ?Simply reacting because six words are beeped out when they in no way affect your artistic freedom is just a knee-jerk reaction. Please look at the larger picture.?The censor chief also points out a serious legal breach on the part of this documentary?s makers. ?They have screening the film without a censor certificate in various public places of India.

Saudi Prince arrested after videos show him assaulting men,"A Saudi prince has been arrested after a video emerged online purporting to show him abusing someone and pointing a rifle at another.King Salman ordered the arrest and interrogation of the prince on Wednesday, a day after short clips were published on YouTube and shared on Twitter showing what appears to be a rifle pointed towards a man bleeding from the head and pleading.One video, viewed more than 760,000 times, shows 18 bottles of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky on a table and a wad of cash. The sale and consumption of alcohol in Saudi Arabia is forbidden.Another shows a man sitting in a car, bleeding and being cursed at for parking in front of a house, while a further clip shows what appears to be the prince punching and slapping a man sitting on a chair.The clips went viral in Saudi Arabia under an Arabic Twitter hashtag that said ?prince transgresses on citizens?.???? ????? ????? ??? ???????? ???????.????? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ???????? ???? ?????? ????? .#????_?????_???_??????? pic.twitter.com/ImCsxwOtJeSaudi Arabia?s state TV reported on Wednesday that the king ordered a full investigation into the incidents and the arrest of Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, as well as any associates who appeared in the clips. He ordered that no individual involved in the case be released until a court had issued a ruling in line with the country?s sharia laws.In the order, King Salman urged people to remain vigilant in monitoring any exploitation of status or abuse of power.After he issued the order, a video seen nearly 250,000 times showed the young, low-level prince, dressed in a black T-shirt and grey jogging bottoms, handcuffed and with his feet chained, being escorted into a building by security officers.While many Saudis wrote in support of the king?s decision on Twitter, the outspoken rights activist Moudi Aljohani said the order pointed to how lax the authorities were when it came to royals.The arrest comes a day after state media reported that a woman filmed walking around a historic Saudi fort in a miniskirt and crop top sparked outrage among conservatives for defying the kingdom?s dress code for women, which requires females in public to cover themselves in long, loose robes. The outcry prompted police to detain and question her for several hours before she was released without charge.While Saudi royals are given privileged status in the kingdom, in addition to undisclosed monthly allowances from the state, they are not immune to prosecution. In an extremely rare event, the kingdom executed a prince last October who had fatally shot another man. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of executions in the world.Since ascending to the throne in 2015, King Salman has branded himself a ?decisive? leader. He has fired ministers caught on video being rude or insulting citizens. He also fired a senior royal court official who was filmed slapping a photographer.Before becoming king, Salman served as the governor of the capital, Riyadh, and as defence minister.

UK's first woman Sikh MP elected to key Parliamentary panel,"By Aditi Khanna London, Jul 18 (PTI) Britains first woman Sikh MP has been elected to an influential cross-party panel in the UK Parliament that examines the workings of the Home Office. Preet Kaur Gill, who won the Edgbaston seat for the Labour party in the June 8 snap general election, was elected to the Home Affairs Select Committee in the UK Parliament.

Germany rules Muslim girls must take part in swimming class,"Germany?s highest court has ruled that ultra-conservative Muslim girls must take part in mixed swimming classes at school, finding against an 11-year-old pupil who had argued that even wearing a burkini, or full-body swimsuit, breached Islamic dress codes. The constitutional court in Karlsruhe on Wednesday rejected an appeal by the girl?s parents that she should be excused from the classes because a burkini did not conform with Islam?s ethic of decency, German media reported. A spokesman for the court could not be reached for comment.Germany is in the grip of a heated public debate about the role of Islam in society as it seeks to integrate more than a million mainly Muslim asylum seekers fleeing war and persecution who have entered this year and last. Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose conservatives have been punished at the polls in regional elections by voters angry at what is seen as her open-door policy, on Tuesday proposed a ban on full-face Muslim veils.Her Christian Democrats, who have been bleeding support to the AfD, a populist party that says Islam is incompatible with the constitution, toughened their tone on integrating migrants at a party conference this week. Wednesday?s ruling could give more credibility to future attempts by the government to ban the full-face veil after a parliamentary election next year. The girl had argued before lower courts that swimming in a burkini revealed the shape of her body, something that goes against her religion. The constitutional court noted that lower courts had found this to be untrue, and further found there were ?no binding rules in Islam? to define appropriate clothing.",world,1650,59,70
US lawmakers ask Trump to cut Pak aid for supporting terror,"terror By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jun 17 (PTI) Two top lawmakers have accused Pakistan of supporting terrorism and urged the Trump administration to cut military aid to the country, saying the US should make it more difficult for Islamabad to get its hands on American weapons. During a Congressional hearing this week, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and Ted Poe, alleged that Pakistan is engaged in terrorism and asserted that the US needs to cut its military assistance to it. ""We need to go on the record here, on this part of our government, to say that were not going to be providing weapons to countries like Pakistan that were afraid will shoot down our own people and afraid we know theyre engaged in terrorism,"" Rohrabacher said during a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade hearing on Foreign Military Sales. ""We know what theyve done now. They still hold Dr. Afridi (who helped locate Osama bin Laden)...in a dungeon,"" he said. ""We should be facilitating our support and our weapons systems to countries like Egypt that are fighting this threat to Western civilisation, to all of civilisation. And we should make it more difficult not less difficult for countries like Pakistan to get their hands on American weapons,"" Rohrabacher asserted. Congressman Ted Poe, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade, said that the US is having the issue with Pakistan whether ""theyre loyal or playing us for years on the issue of aid"" to Pakistan and sales to Pakistan. ""We were concerned about the Pakistanis scrambling F-16s that we made and sold to the Pakistanis so that they wouldnt shoot down Americans who were doing the job of taking out this terrorist. I personally think Pakistan plays the United States because they turn to China if we dont help them,"" Poe said. ""I understand all that. They have nuclear weapons and we want to have a relationship with them so that they dont look to China. I get all that. But are we doing anything different on sales to Pakistan to make sure those sales of whatever it is arent used against us directly or used against us indirectly because of the military helping the Taliban in Afghanistan where were have our troops and those weapons could be used against the United States?"" he asked.

"Wanting MSD to bat, crowd chants 'Saurabh Tiwary haye haye'","Fans who turned up to watch a MS Dhoni special returned disappointed even as Jharkhand cruised to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Services for their second victory in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Tuesday.Chasing a stiff 277, Jharkhand did not require services of their captain 'cool' as Saurabh Tiwary (102 not out off 103 balls; 3x4, 6x6) and Ishank Jaggi (116 not out off 92 balls; 10x4, 4x6) put together an unbroken 214-run partnership to script a fluent chase with 22 balls to spare.He may not have played a role with the bat but Dhoni's tips during the drinks break played a big role in their win, Jaggi later revealed. (MS Dhoni's century lights up Eden Gardens)""Mahi bhai advised us to play in a calm and composed manner. He told us, 'If you play with patience runs will come. It's about staying there and finish the game',"" Jaggi said.The lefthander Tiwary added: ""We played without any pressure well aware of the fact that MS comes next.""Jharkhand had a shaky build-up and were reduced to 65/3 inside 17 overs but poor fielding from Services let the duo build on a firm stand. Yet to open his account, Tiwary was dropped at mid-off by Shakti Malviya off Poonam Poonia, while Jaggi got a reprieve on 25.At 107/3 midway into their innings, the match tilted heavily in favour of Services with required run rate going past six. (MS Dhoni's hundred helps Jharkhand sink Chhattisgarh in Vijay Hazare Trophy)It was an ideal situation for the 'finisher' Dhoni as the crowd kept on shouting his name in anticipation but Tiwary and Jaggi did not take a step wrong and complemented each other in their solid left-right combination.They kept rotating strikes and got an odd boundary or six in every over providing a calm assurance in the dressing room as the crowd started to become frustrated and shouted 'Saurabh Tiwary Hai Hai'.Tiwary however took it in a positive spirit and said: ""We must understand that they're emotional as Mahi bhai never played here...Being a professional I did not mind. We were subjected to much more sledging on the field.""Having slowly built their innings, the duo took charge of the show and Jaggi completed his sixth List A century in 82 balls with a boundary in the 42nd over, while Tiwary followed suit reaching his second List A hundred in 100 balls. (Vijay Hazare Trophy: MS Dhoni's 43 goes in vain as Karnataka beat Jharkhand)Having trolled by the crowd in his exquisite knock, Tiwary later acknowledged his hundred to the crowd gesturing that 'keep shouting'.But Dhoni returned on the field during the customary handshake after the win and walked midway on to the boundary rope near the spectators and waved at them.Thousands gathered outside the venue unable to enter, while a few hundreds managed to get in with passes, while rooftops of the residential buildings and a school surrounding the stadium wore a packed look since 9 am in a never-before atmosphere.But the only action they could have of Dhoni was his two run-outs and a caught-behind dismissal on a flat deck of Bengal Cricket Academy in the small industrial township of Kalyani about 50 kilometres from Kolkata.Earlier Services could not capitalise on a solid 104-run opening partnership between Gaurav Kochar (50) and Nakul Verma (48) to be restricted for 276/9.Fresh from his 124 against Saurashtra here two days ago, Verma missed a half-century narrowly when Vikash Singh gave the first breakthrough of the day in the 20th over.Dhoni produced a spectacular runout to dismiss Abhijit Salvi (31) before his caught behind claimed the skipper Soumya Swain's wicket for 12 to reduce them to 158/4 in 32nd over.Salvi played on the legside for a single but Dhoni was quick to gather the ball and hit the stumps directly at the opposite end.But it was Shamser Yadav and Rahul Singh who added a quick 84-run for the fifth wicket from 13.2 overs to prop the lower order.

Divya's role in Babumoshai Bandookbaaz not inspired by Amma,"Rumour has it that Divya Dutta's character in Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is based on late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.

India has 2nd highest number of adults planning to migrate,"India has the second highest number of adults planning to migrate to other countries with the US and the UK among the most favoured destinations, according to a report by the UN migration agency.The UN migration agency, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), in its report Measuring Global Migration Potential 2010-2015, which analyses people?s migration intentions globally for the 2010-2015, noted that globally 1.3% of the adult population or 66 million people said they were planning to migrate permanently within the next 12 months.The most popular destinations for those planning to migrate is the US followed by the UK, Saudi Arabia, France, Canada, Germany and South Africa.Half of those planning to migrate live in 20 countries, led by Nigeria and followed by India, Congo, Sudan, Bangladesh and China.At 4.8 million people, India has the highest number of adults planning and preparing to migrate ? 3.5 million people who are planning and 1.3 million who are preparing.For Nigeria, the number stands at 5.1 million people, Congo 4.1 million, and China and Bangladesh at 2.7 million each.The findings by IOM?s Global Migration Data Centre (GMDAC) shows that less than half a per cent of adults worldwide or 23 million people are actively making preparations to migrate abroad. One in three adults surveyed plans to migrate to a developing country.West Africa, South Asia and North Africa are the regions with the largest migration potential.The study is based on international survey data by the Gallup World Poll.?This unique global survey provides an important insight into people?s migration intentions and the profile of those most likely to migrate,? said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing.The share of the adult population planning to migrate abroad has increased moderately at the global level but more rapidly in certain regions. Adults planning and preparing to migrate are more likely to be male, young, single, living in urban areas and more likely to have completed at least secondary education.?Improving our understanding of people?s migration intentions could be useful for a range of different policy purposes. It could help policymakers plan for migration, understand better migration pressures, as well as highlighting potential migration trends where alternative sources of migration data are scarce,? it said. The report, however, added that it is important to note that measuring potential migration is not the same as measuring actual migration.There are many reasons why a migration plan may never be realised including policy restrictions, lack of resources or a change of heart. IOM Director General Swing added that the new study illuminates one trend that has been emerging for some time, which he explained was the ?wide range of countries, both rich and poor, that are attracting migrants.?",general,2848,58,70
"14 yrs jail for killing cow, 2 yrs for killing people: Judge","When a Delhi judge sentenced the son of a Haryana-based industrialist to two years? imprisonment on Saturday for mowing down a motorcyclist with his luxury car in 2008, he couldn?t help but observe how present-day laws provide more stringent punishment to perpetrators of cattle-related crimes than errant drivers who take human lives. ?The sentence for killing cow is five, seven or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,? additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar said.The court held the accused, 30-year-old Utsav Bhasin, guilty of rash driving, voluntarily causing hurt on provocation and causing death by negligence. It also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh for the injured.On the night of September 11, 2008, Bhasin ? then a BBA student ? had crushed Anuj Chauhan and his friend, Mrigank Srivastava, under his BMW car at Moolchand in South Delhi. While Chauhan died in a city hospital, Srivastava survived the accident. Bhasin was arrested from ISBT Kashmere Gate while he was fleeing to Chandigarh.Though the court had passed the verdict in May, the quantum of punishment was pronounced only on Saturday. It also granted statutory bail to Bhasin, enabling him to file an appeal in the high court. The bail bond was fixed at Rs 50,000 with surety of a similar amount.Bhasin was earlier cleared of culpable homicide, which provides for a maximum jail term of up to 10 years.The court said a copy of the judgment must be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he can consider steps to enhance the punishment prescribed for such offences under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The judge also quoted a song from the movie Jindagi aur Toofan ? which goes ?Aadmi chahe toh taqdeer badal sakte hai, poori duniya ki woh tasveer badal sakte hai, aadmi soch toh le uska irada kya hai (Humankind can change its fate if it wants to, can change the entire picture of the world if it wants to, as long as there is a strong resolve to do so)? ? to buttress his point.The court noted that India has a ?disreputable record of road accidents?, with a total of 4.64 lakh road accidents being reported in 2015 alone.",general,2260,60,70

BJP will have to perform role of Oppn as well: Uma Bharti,"Union Minister for Water Recourses Uma Bharti on Monday sais that the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party will have to stay alert and on a continuous vigil as there was no Opposition in the country. ""We have just recorded an unprecedented victory in the biggest state of India. We also have a majority in the Lok Sabha. The biggest take away of this election is that the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased from what it was in May 2014 but at the same time we can see that that there is no Opposition. So we will have to perform the role of the Opposition as well,"" Bharti said while addressing a press conference in Bhopal.""These election results have shown that we have reached a position which the Congress had occupied for a long time after the Bangladesh war of liberation but at that time we were a strong Opposition and provided the glue around which all opposition parties stuck. The Congress, however, is not in that position and is fast losing the little credibility that it had. The party does not have any standing of its own and is trying to latch on to regional players for face saving. This puts an additional responsibility on the BJP,"" Bharti said.On parallels being drawn between her coronation as chief minister in 2003 and that of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, Bharti said, ""The saffron colour of robes is not the only similarity that we have. He is like my younger brother and I stay at the Gorakhpur math whenever I go there but the colour of the robes has nothing to do with the performance of any chief minister. Adityanath is an able administrator and he will take strong steps to improve the law and order situation in the state.",general,1698,57,70
"First UK-China freight train completes 12,000 km in 20 days","The first freight train to link China directly to the UK reached in the eastern Chinese city of Yiwu on Saturday. The freight train covered 12,000 km which makes the journey the second-longest route in the world. This second longest journey from China to the UK is China's efforts to strengthen the trade links with western Europe along a modern-day ""Silk Road"" route.THE FREIGHT AND ITS JOURNEYThe train was loaded with pharmaceuticals, machinery, baby milk and whiskey. The first train which links China to the UK over the period of 20 days, passed through France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan.It finally arrived in Yiwu in eastern Zhejiang province which is a major wholesale centre for small consumer goods.THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE LINKThe route is the second largest and is longer than the Trans-Siberian railway where the run is from Moscow, Russia to Pyongyang in North Korea. The new freight train linking China directly to the UK is about 1000 km shorter than the record-holding China-Madrid link, which opened in 2014.The provincial government said that the journey should be 30 days faster than moving the goods by ship but this pilot run took two days more than the 18 days expected, NDTV reported. The first direct London-China freight train named the East Wind has much less carrying capacity. It has just 88 shipping containers compared to the 10,000 to 20,000 containers cargo ships can carry, according to the Yiwu government.London is the 15th city to be linked to a new freight network offered by the state-run China Railway Corporation, which says its services are cheaper than air transport and quicker than shipping.ECONOMIC SENSE OF EAST WIND",general,1693,59,70

Bus seats mistaken for burqas by Norway anti-immigrant group,"A Norwegian anti-immigrant group has been roundly ridiculed after members apparently mistook a photograph of six empty bus seats posted on its Facebook page for a group of women wearing burqas.?Tragic?, ?terrifying? and ?disgusting? were among the comments posted by members of the closed Fedrelandet viktigst, or ?Fatherland first?, group beneath the photograph, according to screenshots on the Norwegian news website Nettavisen.Other members of the 13,000-strong group, for people ?who love Norway and appreciate what our ancestors fought for?, wondered whether the non-existent passengers might be carrying bombs or weapons beneath their clothes. ?This looks really scary,? wrote one. ?Should be banned. You can?t tell who?s underneath. Could be terrorists.?Further comments read: ?Ghastly. This should never happen,? ?Islam is and always will be a curse,? ?Get them out of our country ? frightening times we are living in,? and: ?I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW,? according to thelocal.no and other media.The photograph, found on the internet, was posted ?for a joke? last week by Johan Slåttavik, who has since described himself as ?Norway?s worst web troll and proud of it?, beneath a question asking the group: ?What do people think of this??Slåttavik told Nettavisen and Norway?s TV2 he wanted to ?highlight the difference between legitimate criticism of immigration and blind racism?, and was ?interested to see how people?s perceptions of an image are influenced by how others around them react. I ended up having a good laugh.?It went viral in Norway after Sindre Beyer, a former Labour party MP who said he has been following Fatherland first for some time, published 23 pages of screenshots of the group?s outraged comments.?What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group, and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burqas?? he asked in a post shared more than 1,800 times. The comments suggested the vast majority of the anti-immigrant group?s members saw the photo as evidence of the ongoing ?Islamification? of Norway, although a small number pointed out it was in fact a picture of bus seats. One warned the group was making itself look ridiculous.Beyer told Nettavisen: ?I?m shocked at how much hate and fake news is spread [on the Fedrelandet viktigst page]. So much hatred against empty bus seats certainly shows that prejudice wins out over wisdom.?The head of Norway?s Antiracist Centre, Rune Berglund Steen, told the site that people plainly ?see what they want to see ? and what these people want to see are dangerous Muslims?.Norway recently became the latest European country to propose restrictions on the wearing of burqas and niqabs, tabling a law that will bar them from kindergartens, schools and universities. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria all restrict full-face veils in some public places.The country?s minority government, a coalition of the centre-right Conservatives and the populist Progress party that faces elections next month, said in June it was confident it would find opposition support for the move.Per Sandberg, then acting immigration and integration minister, told a press conference that face-covering garments such as the niqab or burqa ?do not belong in Norwegian schools.

Gorkhaland supporter killed in 'police firing' in Darjeeling,"A Gorkhaland supporter was allegedy shot dead by police during a demonstration in Darjeeling?s Mirik town, statehood activists said on Tuesday, the 8th death in a violent unrest in West Bengal?s hill districts.Asish Tamang, 38, was killed on Monday night when police allegedly opened fire on a group of Gorkhaland supporters in the popular tourist town, about 50 km from Darjeeling.Police refused to comment on the issue. The Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee, spearheading the statehood movement, is scheduled to meet at Kalimpong on Tuesday, and Tamang?s death could trigger fresh tension in the hills. The committee is an umbrella body of several organisations which are demanding creation of a Gorkhaland state, to be carved out of the hills and parts of Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts in north Bengal.An indefinite shutdown of the hills entered the 34th day on Tuesday with no signs of an early settlement to the issue.The state government led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee has ruled out bifurcation of the state and has blamed ?outside forces?, including militant groups of the northeast and Maoist rebels from Nepal, of backing the Gorkhaland movement.Yogesh Goley, a senior member of the Gorkha Janmukti Yuva Morcha, said Tamang was killed around 10.30 pm. Activists said police fired on them when they gheraoed the Mirik police station demanding release of a Gorkhaland supporter who was detained following a clash between agitators and Trinamool supporters. Police, however, deny opening fire in any of the incidents which have allagedy killed eight people.Darjeeling, known as the Queen of the Hills for its picturesque tourist spots, and other hill areas of the state are on the boil since the first week of June when the GJM launched an agitation over alleged attempts to impose Bengali in schools of the Gorkha-dominated hills.The GJM later revived the 110-year old statehood demand but has refused to hold talks with the Mamata-led government.",general,1989,60,70

"Felt bad, I'm human after all: Aadar on nepotism remarks","By Juhi Chakraborty New Delhi, Jul 24 (PTI) Aadar Jains entry in Bollywood comes at a time when the nepotism debate has gained momentum but the newcomer says he would like people to not judge him before seeing his work. Aadar, the grandson of Raj Kapoor, will make his debut with ""Qaidi Band"" and his launch event was hosted by his cousin Ranbir Kapoor. In an interview with PTI, the actor says he is aware of the debate around nepotism and the negative comments his launch attracted. ""As a newcomer, who has always dreamt of becoming an actor, it was a huge deal for me to be introduced like that. I read the comments after the launch about nepotism. ""When you work so hard, give it all, an entire year of blood, sweat and hard work and then you read about these comments, you feel bad. I am human after all,"" Aadar says. But the 23-year-old actor does not want to get into the debate of whether he is talented or not. ""I dont want to say anything. Yes, I feel bad when people says things without seeing my work. I want my work to speak for itself. Thats the only thing I am here for."" However, Aadar does have an opinion about nepotism in the film industry. The youngster says someone belonging to a film family does get an easy opportunity to meet a director or a casting director but it does not guarantee a movie as an actor can only go forward on the basis of merit. ""The industry believes in talent. It doesnt matter what background you are from, you might be an outsider or from a film family, what matters is your talent. I had to audition for the film. ""I might come from a film family but that didnt guarantee me anything. At the end of the day I dont think a writer, director or producer will invest in a person who does not have the talent."" On the contrary, Aadar feels actors, who hail from film families, have to deal with the burden of expectations. Yash Raj Films ""Qaidi Band"" has been directed by Habib Faisal and will also serve as the launchpad for another newcomer, Anya Singh. The film is about seven under-trials, who form a musical band in the prison. The movie is a far-cry from the usual glamorous debut which newcomers often opt for but Aadar says he didnt think of it like that when he signed the project. ""I had not thought about it as an unconventional film and thats why I did it. This is a kind of film that I would like to watch. It is refreshing, new and a story not told before."" On his role as a prison inmate, Aadar says he had no real understanding of how to go about the role as his only references have been movies and TV shows like ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Prison Break"". ""I didnt know what actually happens inside a prison. That was very interesting for me especially the under-trial situation. That fascinated me. Those are the reasons why I wanted to do the film."" ""Qaidi Band"" releases on August 25. Aadars elder brother, Armaan Jain, made his debut in 2014 with ""Lekar Hum Deewana Dil"", which was a box office dud. The actor says Armaan has not taken a beating and will soon announce his second Bollywood venture.",general,3064,56,70
"'Chant Jai Shri Ram or we'll set car on fire', Muslim told","For Munne Bharti, June 28 was supposed to be an uneventful day. Along with his parents and wife, Bharti, a reporter and social worker, was driving down to visit a sick relative in his native village in Bihar. The drive, however, turned out to be one filled with horror and one that made Bharti fear for his and his family's life after a large group of people he identified as Bajrang Dal activists accosted them and made Bharti chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. That would not have happened if his wife wasn't wearing a nikab and if his father had shaved that day, Bharti indicated in a Facebook post recounting the incident. On June 28, Bharti and his family were on their way to Rahimbad, a village in Bihar's Samastipur district located around 75 kilometers north east of capital Patna. As the family neared their destination, they got caught in a traffic jam at Margan Chowk on National Highway 28. Bharti says he and family joined the line of trucks that had been halted by people who seemed to Bajrang Dal activists. They were sporting saffron scarves around their necks and were chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans, Bharti recounts. ""As they neared my car, I asked them what the commotion was about,"" Bharti says. In response, Bharti says, a few of the alleged Bajrang Dal men looked inside his car and noticed his father, who had a beard, and his wife, who was wearing a nikab. ""On seeing this, their sloganeering intensified, and before I could understand what was going on, two people shoved their heads into the car through the windows and said, 'Chant Jai Shri Ram or we will set your car on fire', sending me in shock,"" Bharti recounts in his Facebook post. Fearing for his and his family's life, Bharti goes on to describe how he immediately did what he was asked to, and chanted 'Jai Shri Ram' so that he and his family could escape from the spot alive. 'RESPECT RAM'""I respect all religions and respect Ram from the bottom of my heart,"" Bharti says in his Facebook post. ""I do not have a problem with chanting Jai Shri Ram, but the fear-filled manner in which I was made to do that [on that day] was not nice,"" Bharti says. Having followed the men's commands, Bharti and his family quickly escape from the location, taking another route to Rahimbad. After driving for a few minutes, Bharti stopped and tweeted to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recounting his ordeal in a short sentence. He also called up Janata Dal (United)'s Neeraj Kumar and Samastipur MLA Akhtarul Islam Sahin, informing them about the episode and requesting that police be sent to the location to prevent any untoward incidents. @NitishKumar à¤¸à¤®à¤¸à¤¤à¥?à¤ªà¥?à¤° à¤?à¥? à¤®à¤¾à¤°à¤?à¤¨ à¤?à¥?à¤? à¤ªà¤° à¤¬à¤?à¤°à¤?à¤? à¤¦à¤² à¤¨à¥? à¤¨à¥?à¤¶à¤¨à¤² à¤¹à¤¾à¤?à¤µà¥? à¤?à¥? à¤°à¥?à¤?à¤¾, à¤®à¥?à¤°à¥? à¤?à¤¾à¤° à¤?à¥? à¤°à¥?à¤? à¤?à¤° à¤?à¤¹à¤¾ à¤?à¤¯ à¤¶à¥?à¤°à¥?à¤°à¤¾à¤® à¤µà¤°à¤¨à¤¾ à¤?à¤¾à¤° à¤«à¥?à¤?à¤? à¤¦à¥?à¤?à¤?à¥?,à¤?à¤¾à¤¨ à¤¬à¤?à¤¾à¤?à¤° à¤µà¤¾à¤ªà¤¸ pic.twitter.com/lXrBH7FIYOAfter reaching Ramhimbad, Bharti postponed his departure for Delhi, saying in another Facebook post that a day after the incident, he was still fearful for his life.

Marine life thrives on island 71 yrs after 23 nuclear tests,"The former island paradise of Bikini Atoll is slowing blooming back to life, 70 years after the United States dropped 23 nuclear bombs on it, including a device in 1954 that was 1,100-times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team?s initial research suggests it is ?remarkably resilient?. Animals studied by scientists in and around the Chernobyl blast showed deformities and mutations, but the Stanford teams initial research suggest the marine life in Bikini may have fared significantly better. Palumbi?s team discovered a diverse eco-system of animal life in and around the bomb crater, including coral as big as ?cars?, hundreds of schools of fish including tuna, sharks and snapper, and coconut crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore. Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades ? with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.?The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral. In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place, the fish populations are better than in some other places because they have been left alone, the sharks are more abundant and the coral are big. It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.? Palumbi?s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs ? which are the size of hub caps ? because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years. Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll. ?This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life,? said Palumbi. ?The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we?ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.?Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities. A United Nations report in 2012 said the effects of radiation were long-lasting. Special rapporteur Calin Georgescu, in a report to the UN human rights council, said ?near-irreversible environmental contamination? had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience ?indefinite displacement?.The water cannot be drunk because of continued contamination, the seafood cannot be eaten, and plants cannot be farmed because of contaminated soil. More than half of the 167 original inhabitants of Bikini Atoll have now died, and many went to their graves still longing to return to their homeland. According to a paper by Timothy J. Jorgensen, associate professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University, former residents of Bikini Atoll started showing cancers related to radiation exposure in the 1960s.

India's first transgender Sub-Inspector joins TN police,"After fighting social dogma, gender bias and many glass ceilings, K Prithika Yashini has become the first transgender to be appointed as a police officer in Tamil Nadu.Prithika Yashini, who was born as Pradeep Kumar had to first fight the society to alter identify which she succeeded after a sex change operation to become who she believed she was from within.Yashini attempted to achieve a next to impossible goal by applying to become a police officer even after being fully aware of that the in police force is alleged filled with male chauvinism.Many couldn't even digest her bold move of applying for the force. Her application was also rejected stating that there were only two columns under which she can restrict her gender identity, either 'male' or 'female' but she went ahead and filled it as 'transgender'. This led to a legal battle and finally citing a Court order she won the battle against 'Tamil Nadu Uniform Services Recruitment Board'.YASHINI FAILED IN PHYSICAL TEST Then came the physical endurance and stamina stress where she cleared every test except the 100 meter dash where she reportedly failed by 1 second which almost led to her disqualification.

Hotel staff to get training to spot signs of sex trafficking,"Hotels in Mumbai and other Indian cities are to train their staff to spot signs of sex trafficking such as frequent requests for bed linen changes or a ""Do not disturb"" sign left on the door for days on end. The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. ""Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,"" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. ""(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.""The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl's reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get 'School of Justice' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case",world,3249,60,70

"Dravid spent 735 hrs 52 mins at crease, most for any batsman","Rahul Dravid, one of the greatest Test batsmen in cricket's rich history, came out to bat for the first time in international cricket on June 22, 1996. It was a big occasion for Dravid, who made his Test debut against England at Lord's -- the Mecca of Cricket -- alongside Sourav Ganguly.Dravid started his debut innings at No.7 and proved his credentials with a typically gritty Test knock of 95 off 267 balls. He was also involved in a 94-run stand for the sixth wicket with centurion Ganguly (131) as the match ended in a draw. That partnership marked the start of a golden era for Indian cricket as Dravid, Ganguly, VVS Laxman along with Sachin Tendulkar took Indian cricket to new highs. (Rahul Dravid urges decisive call on MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh's role in team)Dravid played for 16 years for India before retiring in 2012 after India's dismal tour of Australia. He holds the record for facing most number of balls, 31,258 -- 1821 more balls than Sachin Tendulkar had faced in his 24-year career -- and spent 44152 minutes at the crease, most by any batsman in the history.Dravid aggregated 13288 runs from 164 Tests the help of 36 hundreds at 52.31. In ODIs, Dravid played 344 matches scoring 10889 with 12 hundreds and 83 half-centuries. (Rahul Dravid set to extend his tenure as India A, Under-19 coach)Dravid was famously known as 'The Wall'. The exceptional batting talent not just scored runs in India but all over the world.In one of the most memorable knocks by Dravid in 2001, the Karnataka batsman joined forces with VVS Laxman to guide India to one of best Test victories in Indian cricket's history. Dravid had a below par Test series to his standards until that innings. Following on, India were struggling to save the match tottering at 232/4 when Dravid joined an in-form Laxman at the crease. The duo put on a mammoth 376-run stand as India declared their second innings at a massive 657 for seven. Laxman had scored 281 while Dravid hit 180.Chasing 394 for a win, Australia were off to a solid opening stand before Harbhajan Singh ripped apart Australian batting line-up with 6/73 to give India a historic win to level the three-match series 1-1.Some of the interesting stats from the great man's Test career:# Dravid was involved in most number of Test victories -- 15 -- overseas with an astonishing batting average of 65.70.# He was the highest run-getter batting at No.3. He scored 10,524 from 219 innings at 52.88 with the help of 28 hundreds and 50 fifties.# He was involved in a record 738 partnerships in Test career.# Dravid was also part of 88 century-plus partnerships involving Sachin Tendulkar (20), VVS Laxman (12), Virender Sehwag (10) and Sourav Ganguly Ganguly(10)",general,2704,60,70
China's richest man looks for successor after son refuses,"From K J M Varma Beijing, Dec 12 (PTI) Chinas richest man, owning a USD 92 billion empire, today said he is looking for a successor, most likely from a group of professional managers, to take over his business after his son declined to be his heir apparent. Wang Jianlin, 62, founder and chairman of Dalian Wanda Group Co, whose business includes shopping malls, theme parks, sports clubs and cinemas, said he is most likely to pick from a group of professional managers to take over the running of his business. ""I have asked my son about the succession plan, and he said he does not want to live a life like I do,"" Wang was quoted as saying by Hong Kongs South-China Morning Post at China Entrepreneurs Summit. ""Perhaps young people have their own quests and priorities. Probably it will be better to hand over to professional managers and we sit on the board and see them run the company,"" he said. The wealthy scions of Chinas billionaire entrepreneurs, known as fuerdai are increasingly striking different paths, as more than three decades of break-neck economic growth and overseas education have given them different experiences, world view and aspirations from their parents. More than 80 per cent of Chinese heirs are not keen on assuming the reins of their parents businesses, a survey by the Shanghai Jiaotong University, covering 182 of the countrys top family-run companies said. Some were backing off due to intense pressures, while others simply were pursuing other career interests, study by the association of Chinese private enterprises showed, the Post report said. Wanda, founded in the port city of Dalian in 1988, is the epitome of Chinas rags-to-wealth story, where it grew from a small property developer into a conglomerate operating malls, hotels, theme parks and the worlds largest chain of movie cinemas. In the process, its made Wang and his only son immensely wealthy. Wang, who visited India and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi had committed to invest about USD 10 billion in a Chinese project in Haryana.",general,2038,57,70

Not responsible for women's safety after work: B'luru firm,"The murder of Prathibha, a BPO employee way back on December 13, 2005 shocked the entire industry. This tragic incident led to many changes especially with better safety measures being implemented by IT/BT and BPO companies.However, in Bengaluru where the incident took place, it looks some companies are still trying to save money by not providing their women employees who work in the night shift with cab pick-up and drop facilities. One such is IDC Technologies that is located on Hosur Main Road in Madiwala. This company has its Global Operating Centres in the US, Canada, Mexico and India. Manisha Kumari, a technical recruiter, has decided to bring out the lackadaisical attitude of the company officials when it comes to safety of women at their workplace.Having joined this tech company in the month of February, she was told that there would be no cab pick-up and drop facility for one month and thereafter things would be sorted out. But till today, the company has not provided any cab facility at all. In fact, she tells India Today that it is just not for the past few months, but this issue has been dragging on for the last 2 years. Initially, the female employees worked from 6.30pm to 3.30am, but when they complained that they cannot get transport that early in the morning, the timings were changed from 7.30pm to 4.30am.Manisha says that there were many female employees who travelled far and this was proving to be a hassle and dangerous as well. So much so that some of them would wait after their log out hours till sunrise before heading out to find themselves an auto, bus or cab. This is risky and Manisha herself faced three incidents of harassment after logging out even though she lives just 4km from the office. Telling us what happened, she says, ""Once, I was harassed by a cab driver near the Silk Board Junction who misbehaved with me when I was leaving work and another time by 2 bike-borne men. The third incident was by a passerby."" She received no help from the tech company since the Vice President had clearly told them all that the company is only responsible for them while they are working and not when they log out.MINISTERS SAYS WILL TAKE ACTIONManisha today met the IT Minister Priyank Kharge, who gave her a patient hearing and assured action will be taken after she files a written complaint with his department. He tells India Today that his department writes to these companies every quarter or six months to follow these rules. The minister also promised that, ""If companies flout these rules, we will take action because there are set rules for this.""COMPANY DODGES QUESTIONS India Today then visited IDC Technologies to confront them on this matter. From initially refusing to respond to these allegations, they claimed that they have done nothing wrong. However, their HR in-charge of the night shift tried to dodge our questions by saying that negotiations are on with cab vendors to get this facility started. He further went on to add that it is not easy to get this sorted out quickly because they have to deal with the management and there are costs involved as well. As of now, he tells us that they are having discussions and once the management approves the budget, the cabs can be deployed.The HR of IDC Technologies says that since they never had cab facilities for women working in the night shift, women in general never joined them. But, since the past 3 months they have had a lot of female employees joining. So to avoid giving them cabs, the company has increased their CTC so that female employees can manage their own transportation.Towards the end of 2016, the state government removed restrictions on allowing women to work in night shifts in all sectors and not only in IT and ITES sectors. But this came with stringent rules and regulations. The Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961 and the Factories Act 1948 were amended to make provision for women to work in night shifts with a slew of conditions to ensure their safety, security and privacy needs. This included written consent, provision of separate loos, first priority in pick-up and drop, among others.",business,4148,58,70
CBI to probe appointment of AAP Minister's daughter,"Appointment of Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain's daughter Soumya Jain as the advisor in the health department may land Arvind Kejriwal government in further trouble. With the recommendation from Delhi LG, the case of Soumya's appointment as the Advisor to the Mission Director, Delhi State Health Mission has been referred to the premier investigating agency, CBI to further investigate into the matter. The letter, which has been forwarded from Delhi government after getting direction from LG office, has cited several reasons for the investigation in the matter of Soumya's appointment by the CBI.

Interestingly, the letter says that although the appointment has been made on 18th April but the Mission Director under, which she has to work has given approval for her appointment on 10th May 2016. The letter to CBI also mentioned that as per her application and Bio Data she doesn't seem to have any experience of health sector as Soumya has the background in the field of architecture.APPOINTMENT WITHOUT A SELECTION PROCESSThe case, which has been made against Soumya's appointment, further says that her appointment was in response to her request and not a result of selection through open and transparent process. The letter also says that she offered her services without any financial consideration, but the information provided by the Administrative Department reveals that an amount of Rs 1.15 lakhs was spent on her tour and training. It further says that the proposal regarding her appointment is silent about the existence of the post of Advisor, Mission Director at the relevant time.SERIOUS QUESTIONS UNANSWEREDPointing fingers on the Kejriwal government's intention to appoint Soumya Jain as the Advisor, the letter raises some serious points too. One of the points in the five-point-letter also says that the selection process in the government cannot be reduced to favoritism and it must offer opportunity to all concerned to apply and compete so as to attract the best talent around. READ| BJP MLA and supporters demand Satyendra Jain's removal, shave head in protestThe letter also quoted Article 14 of the constitution in the forwarding letter to the premier investigating agency, which provides insight on the process of appointment in government organizations. It says that since an Advisor can influence decision of government with consequential bearing on finances and hence the selection process needs to be neutral. APPOINTMENT FILE AMONG THOSE UNDER THE SCANNERThe letter also clearly mentions that in view of the direction of LG office to submit the files which require approval of Lieutenant Governor, the file related to Satyendra Jain's daughter Soumya as Advisor to the Mission Director, Delhi State Health Mission was also submitted by the Health and Family Welfare department to the LG office.",health,3806,51,70

The government has made it mandatory to install Global Positioning System (GPS) in all mobile phones, including feature phones that will be sold in India, from January 1, 2018 so as to locate subscribers in emergency situations. ?GPS is the main tool regarding location details of the subscriber in emergency, so government has decided to implement it in all the mobile phone handsets from 1 January 2018 in a positive manner,? the DoT has said in a reply to industry body Indian Cellular Association (ICA). ?In the view of above, it is re-iterated that all mobile phone handset manufacturers should also adhere for second part of the gazette notification dated 22-04-2016 for implementation of GPS facility in all mobile phone handsets ...,? it has said.

"Firm loses ?1,690cr in value as boss fired over 'misconduct'","The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for ?gross misconduct?, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.?Bob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,? the AA said.A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a ?personal conduct related matter?, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. ?He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,? it said. ?The family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.?The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement.The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about £200m off the value of the company.Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie?s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman.The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive.In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie?s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company?s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors.?The financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.?We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.?The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. ?At that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,? the company said.Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie?s departure, adding that they ?do not believe that it is fraud-related?.They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to £403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. ?After the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,? the Liberum analysts said. ?We now believe that the face-lift is largely complete.?Some of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.?The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director.",business,3756,60,70

In particular it talked about the failure rate for the call connectivity between a Jio number and a number provided by other telecom operators. And for the high failure rate, it squarely blamed Airtel.""Jio continues to face interconnection congestion issues with some of the large operators on account of inadequate provision of points of interconnection (POI) capacities even months after commencement of services by Jio...

But in December this offer ended and all the consumers were moved to the Happy New Year Offer, which also gave consumers same free calls and data connectivity.

If it?s a local guy, it?s a local guy. If it?s an international, then so be it. You certainly don?t want to get up in the politics of all that. All you can do as a coach is present your case on how you think you can make a difference and help the team perform better,? he said.?If you?re the best man for the job, then you should get offered that opportunity. Speaking as a coach, you only want to be judged on whether you think you can make a difference and help the side, and that?s how it should be.

We cannot ignore the villages because all areas are interconnected,? said Mishra. Poor civic amenities in villages affect urban areas as well, officials said.

The result of the poll is bound to have an impact beyond the borders of the capital.With AAP, Congress and BJP in the fray for the crucial polls, the national capital witnessed an aggressive campaign.The election will determine if Arvind Kejriwal's AAP will retain power in Delhi. AAP made inroads in the 2015 Assembly polls by winning 67 seats out of 70.The BJP, meanwhile, has fielded new candidates across the 267 wards. Earlier this week, the party had expelled one of its candidate from Narela for allegedly involving sacked AAP minister Sandeep Kumar in the campaign.The Congress, which finished second in the Rajouri Garden bypoll, is hoping for a resurgence and banked on its big guns during campaigns to shore up its fortune, despite unabated infighting.

Delhi's iconic 'Hall of Nations' building demolished,"About half a dozen bulldozers worked overnight on Sunday at Pragati Maidan to pull down five iconic buildings ? Hall of Nations and Industry. Next to come under the hammer is Nehru Pavilion. Indian trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) razed the structures two days after their architect Raj Rewal lost the case in Delhi high court on April 20. Conservationists are perplexed as the demolition took place as one petition by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to save these structures is still being heard in the same court with next hearing slated for May 1.ITPO is setting up a world-class Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC) with project value of Rs2,254 crore.

Hall of Nations was demolished quietly on Sunday night when the entire world slept. As these iconic buildings no more exist, we cannot move the apex court.? The Hall of Nations was the venue of Asia 1972 ? the third Asian International Trade Fair coinciding with the India?s silver jubilee year of Independence.The Hall of Nations was constructed in 1972.

But obviously somebody in the ITPO had other motives,? the statement said. In a written statement, ITPO CMD LC Goyal said the execution of IECC requires dismantling of Hall No. 1 to 6, 14 to 20 and state pavilions, including Hall of Nations, Nehru Pavilion and Hall of Industry ? which he claimed are not classified as heritage buildings.?Earlier a PIL and two writ petitions filed by India Institute of Architects in Court of Delhi were dismissed.

We had checked the CCTV footage from the areas where they had committed burglaries and could figure out their faces enough to make a sketch.

I benefitted a lot from the 'serial kisser' tag: Emraan,"Emraan Hashmi is one of those Bollywood celebrities who are never afraid of speaking their mind. He may have been tagged as a ?serial-kisser? in the beginning of his career, but the actor has no reason to shy away from talking about it.?A number of my films in which I was shown kissing did very well in the beginning of my career. So that tag naturally became a part of me. People like to label and box things up, and you just can?t hold that against them. And frankly, this was not something I was running away from. I will be honest. I have benefited a lot from it,? says the actor.After all these years, Emraan feels that now it?s time to do away with the tag, as in the long run, it can restrict his growth as an actor. ?When you evolve as an actor and try to explore new and varied avenues, the tag becomes sort of a deterrent for you. People tend to like you more in a particular kind of role. But for every actor, there is a saturation point. I think I have reached it now, and need to find new kind of roles,? says the 38-year old, who will be seen in the thriller Baadshaho, which releases on September 1. The makers of the multi-starrer film, which also features actors Ajay Devgn, Ileana D?Cruz and Esha Gupta, recently released the first song, which has been climbing up the charts. But what every Emraan fan is looking forward to is the song Piya More, which will be out tomorrow. The song pairs Emraan with actor Sunny Leone for the first time. Emraan is all praise for the 36-year old actor. ?Sunny is a thorough professional. I segregate actors into two types ? ones who are constantly fussy about everything on the sets, and the others who are okay with everything, without any fusses. I think she comes under the second category. It was an absolute joy shooting with her, since she?s a much better dancer than I am!? says Emraan.Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,1874,56,70
"Nursery school holds monkey dance, Maneka Gandhi intervenes","A high-profile nursery school in Delhi landed in soup recently for organising a monkey dance for the entertainment of its students. The Cambridge Montessori Preschool in Ashoka Niketan, Anand Vihar, apparently fetched a madari to cheer its kids, and had to pay for it by removing its principal after Union Minister Maneka Gandhi intervened. Pankaj Kumar, owner of the school, who has a franchise for Cambridge Global, told MAIL TODAY, ""We are all animal lovers. I myself have pet dogs at home. But this is India and we are all not so sensitised towards laws regarding wildlife. It seems the principal didn't know it is illegal to hold monkey dance shows. After I got a call from Maneka Gandhi herself enquiring about the incident, I found out about it and removed the Principal.""Apparently, the school administration gladly put up photographs of the function on its Facebook page. But animal lovers spotted the video and pictures, and wrote several criticising comments before informing Gandhi.

Chinese troops depart for first overseas military base,"Ships carrying Chinese military personnel for Beijing?s first overseas military base, in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, have left China to begin setting up the facility as China?s rapidly modernising military hones its global reach.Djibouti?s position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fuelled worries in India that it would become another of China?s ?string of pearls? of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.China began construction of a logistics base in strategically located Djibouti last year that will resupply naval vessels taking part in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia, in particular.This will be China?s first overseas naval base, although Beijing officially describes it as a logistics facility.State news agency Xinhua said in a short report late on Tuesday the ships had departed from Zhanjiang in southern China ?to set up a support base in Djibouti?.Navy commander Shen Jinlong ?read an order on constructing the base in Djibouti? but the report did not say when the base might formally begin operations.Xinhua said the establishment of the base was a decision made by both countries after ?friendly negotiations, and accords with the common interest of the people from both sides?.?The base will ensure China?s performance of missions, such as escorting, peace-keeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and west Asia,? it said.?The base will also be conducive to overseas tasks including military cooperation, joint exercises, evacuating and protecting overseas Chinese and emergency rescue, as well as jointly maintaining security of international strategic seaways,? the Xinhua report.?Not military expansionism?The People?s Liberation Army Daily said in a front-page commentary this was a landmark move that would increase China?s ability to ensure global peace, especially because it has so many United Nations peacekeepers in Africa and is so involved in anti-piracy patrols.China would not seek military expansionism or get into arms races no matter what happened, it said.?These promises will not change because of the construction of the overseas logistics base,? it said.The state-run Global Times said in an editorial on Wednesday there could be no mistake that this was in fact a military base.?Certainly this is the People?s Liberation Army?s first overseas base and we will base troops there. It?s not a commercial resupply point. It makes sense there is attention on this from foreign public opinion,? said the paper, which is published by the official People?s Daily, said.However, China?s military development was about protecting its own security, it said. ?It?s not about seeking to control the world.?Djibouti, which is about the size of Wales, is located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal. The tiny, barren nation sandwiched between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia also hosts U.S., Japanese and French bases.There has been persistent speculation in diplomatic circles that China would build other such bases, in Pakistan for example, but the government has dismissed this.",world,3152,54,70
"Brexit is going to be a great thing, says Trump","In an interview with British publication, The Times of London, US President-elect Donald Trump spoke on a wide range of issues, including Brexit, Russia, the NATO and the refugee crisis. This was the first time the Republican Trump, who is set to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America on January 20, spoke to a UK publication since his election victory of the Democratic Hillary Clinton. TOP TAKES FROM TRUMP'S THE TIMES INTERVIEWOn Brexit: Terming Britain's exit from the European Union as something that ""is going to end up being a great thing"", the US president-elect predicted that more countries would follow the UK's lead in leaving the 28-nation bloc. The arrival of migrants into Europe was one of the factors behind Brexit, Trump told The Times, calling the refugee influx the ""final straw that broke the camel's back"". Trump said that he would work hard to get a trade deal with the UK ""done quickly and done properly."" The deal would be ""good for both sides"", he added, also confirming that he will meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May soon after he takes office.

He further said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he termed a ""fantastic leader"", made a ""catastrophic mistake"" in letting migrants flood into Germany.On Russia: Trump signaled that he could offer relaxing sanctions imposed against Moscow if the latter agrees to a deal to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons.

Trump also reiterated his often-repeated complaint that some NATO members weren't paying enough. ""We're supposed to protect countries.

Hindu Sena throws b'day bash for 'Saviour of Humanity' Trump,"At 1 pm today, New Delhi's Jantar Mantar will witness a big birthday bash thrown by the right-wing group Hindu Sena in honour of United States President Donald Trump, or as they like to call him, the ""Saviour of Humanity.""Invites to the birthday celebration were circulated by Hindu Sena, which terms itself an 'independent non-profit organisation for Hindu causes', on social media.Posting the invite on Twitter, the group's national president Vishnu Gupta said, ""I'd like to invite you all for Birthday Celebration of our beloved Mr. @realDonaldTrump President of #USA & Saviour of Humanity on 14/06/17"". The invite, which also carries a photo of Donald Trump as a child (it's real), doesn't mention what the festivities at Jantar Mantar will entail. But, the invite does promise a photo exhibition, presumably on the life and times of President Trump.Also, if the Hindu Sena's Trump birthday celebration from last year is to be considered, there will be a decorative cake involved. This is not the first time the Hindu Sena has organised an event around Donald Trump, who turns 70 today. In May last year, the group held a havan, again at Jantar Mantar, praying for Donald Trump's victory in the then upcoming United States presidential election.Later that year in November, just days before the US election, the Hindu Sena pre-emptively celebrated the Republican Trump's victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. MEANWHILE, IN THE USWhile the Hindu Sena is organising a birthday party for Trump at New Delhi's favourite protest site, there is an actual march being planned in New York City to protest the US president's very birth.A group called Rise and Resist, which was formed after Trump was voted to power in November last year, has called on citizens in New York City to march to Trump Tower and hold demonstrations. The group also plans to give him a gift: a plane ticket to Russia (the Trump campaign is being investigated for colluding with the Russian government during the US presidential election). The group's event page on its website says, ""Rise and Resist will be protesting Trump's birthday by marching to Trump Tower in New York and delivering his present: one-way tickets to Russia.""While there is no official word on whether and how Donald Trump will be celebrating his birthday, news agency AFP reported that wife Melania has asked supporters to sign a birthday card the US president will ""never forget"".",general,2434,60,70

"GST could raise India's GDP growth to over 8%, says IMF","From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 22 (PTI) The adoption of the GST could help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to over eight per cent and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, the IMF said today. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also expressed concerns over the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). ""Although some uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is poised to help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to above 8 per cent as it will create a single national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services,"" the IMF said in its annual country report on India. The IMF said larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth, while a sustained period of continued low global energy prices would also be beneficial to India. Noting that Indias tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17 and a half per cent) remains considerably below than its emerging market peers, the IMF said the implementation of a robust GST should be a key priority given its growth-enhancing effects. ""The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible,"" it said. Key production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors, the IMF said. Rationalisation of the structure of direct taxes toward a lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should continue, it said. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. According to the IMF report, Indian authorities were confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly. ""The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax deductions,"" it said. The GST replaces a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services.",general,2394,55,70

New Jio offer classic case of old wine in new bottle: Airtel,"New Delhi, Apr 11 (PTI) After regulator TRAI nixed its complimentary offer, Reliance Jio today announced a new plan of 1GB 4G data daily for 3 months at Rs 309 for its Prime members but rival Airtel dubbed the offer as a case of ""old wine in a new bottle"". Announcing its new offer, Jio said that under the Rs 309 plan it would provide ""unlimited SMS, calling and data (1GB per day at 4G speed) for 3 months on first recharge"". For Rs 509, the company is offering unlimited SMS, calling and double the data (2GB per day) for 3 months on first recharge. The new plans with benefits for Jio Prime members is aimed at encouraging subscribers to ""live the digital life without restrictions"", Jio said in a statement. ""Considering the special benefits that are available to Jio Prime members, customers who were unable to subscribe to Jio Prime for any reason, can continue to do so by paying Rs 408 or Rs 608 (Jio Prime + recharge price) to avail these benefits,"" the statement added. Objecting to the offer, incumbent Bharti Airtel hoped that the ""authority (TRAI) will act against this provocative disregard of their direction"". ""... We are surprised to see what Jio is doing. It violates the spirit of the TRAI directive and essentially continues with a similar plan now masquerading under a different name. This is a classic example of old wine in a new bottle,"" an Airtel spokesperson said. Stating that the industry is in a ""very weak"" position and ""continues to bleed"", Airtel said that the financial impact that telcos are seeing does no good to customers, in the long term. ""With a weakened financial position, companies will find it difficult to raise the capital to invest and roll out broadband networks,"" Airtel cautioned. The move by Jio comes within a week of the telecom regulator asking the Mukesh Ambani telecom company to withdraw its contentious three-month complimentary offer of unlimited data usage and free calls on payment of a minimum Rs 303. TRAI, on April 6, had asked Jio to stop the complimentary service offer saying it was not in accordance with the regulatory framework. TRAI had said that Jio will be required to roll back the 3-month complimentary offer in ""shortest possible time"" but clarified that customers who had already subscribed to the said scheme could avail the benefits till June-end. Earlier this week, telecom operator Vodafone approached TRAI alleging that Jio was inviting last minute subscriptions to its Summer Surprise offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms.",general,2532,60,70

"India wants to host 2032 Olympics, 2030 Asiad: IOA head","India's Olympic Association has asked the government for permission to bid for the 2032 Olympics and 2030 Asian Games as part of a drive to put the country at the heart of the international sporting community, IOA president N. Ramachandran has told Reuters.Ramachandran said the IOA also wanted India to host the Asian Beach Games in 2020, the Olympic Council of Asia's general assembly that year, and the International Olympic Committee session in 2021.The aim, Ramachandran said, was to use the engagement as a catalyst for the growth of Olympic sports in India and to help improve the country's miserable standing in pretty much every sport apart from cricket.As the world's second-most populous nation after China, Ramachandran said it was time for India to follow its powerful neighbour in showcasing its burgeoning economic muscle through sport.Dismissing concerns about whether India can afford to stage such huge sporting spectacles, Ramachandran said the country was one of the few in the region that did have the means.It was up to the government to set the wheels in motion, he told Reuters in an interview.""From my part, I am telling them if you bid, I will make sure you get it,"" he added.Ramachandran said he had spoken about India's prospects of hosting an Olympics with IOC President Thomas Bach, an indication of the early groundwork required for a serious bid.""You cannot take a decision today and say, 'I want to host an Olympic Games tomorrow.' It is an eight-year process. So you have to start now,"" Ramachandran said.""If you are looking at anything it's 2032. That will give you 10 years to improve the infrastructure and you will have a decision (to make) in the next four to six years.""The Indian government had agreed to discuss the proposals in cabinet and revert back to the IOA, Ramachandran added.ECONOMIC POWERWinning the hosting rights for an Olympic Games is not the hot ticket it once was.Los Angeles and Paris are the only candidates left in the race for the 2024 Olympics after four other cities pulled out over cost concerns. The IOC will award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games at the same time and the expectation is that the two cities will host one each.For the 2022 Winter Games, four of six bidders pulled out citing high costs or lack of support, leaving Beijing to beat Almaty in the final vote.Ramachandran was confident India, which has Asia's third-largest economy, would be capable of meeting the costs.""India is one of the emerging economies,"" he said. ""Even assuming you spend $12 billion on an Olympic event, $6 billion will be given to you by the IOC.""What is $6 billion over a period of eight years for a country which has the size of the economy which India has today?""Not many countries today wish to host the Olympics. China has already had everything possible that can be hosted.""In terms of hosting experience, India has successfully staged several global cricket tournaments, and FIFA say they are satisfied with preparations for the Under-17 World Cup in October.But a question mark over the country's ability to host an international multi-sports event has hung over India since the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a $6 billion event billed as Delhi's answer to the Beijing Olympics.LEARNED FROM MISTAKESA series of embarrassments over leaking stadiums and filthy accommodation culminated in Games chief Suresh Kalmadi spending nine months in prison for inflating tenders worth millions of dollars.Ramachandran said there would be no repeat of those blunders.""We have learnt from our mistakes. You see the South Asian Games (in 2016) that was hosted in Guwahati. Nobody said anything,"" he added.""We should stick to what we know best - technical conduct of the Games. Even when we hosted the Commonwealth Games in India, (the IOC) praised the technical conduct of the event. And we also did very well in the medals tally.""While the hosts finished second to Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to say that India has underperformed at the Olympics is an understatement.India has won just 28 medals since 1900, with Abhinav Bindra claiming the country's only individual gold medal in the men's 10 metre air rifle in Beijing.",sports,4182,55,70

"Railways denies food scam, says RTI reply had typing errors","Central Railways on Tuesday issued a clarification on reports of a scam that alleged its catering department had purchased food products at ten times their MRP, saying typing errors in the RTI reply caused the miscommunication.Three inspectors involved in making the RTI reply have been suspended.THE 'MISCOMMUNICATION'Responding to an RTI filed by an activist Ajay Bose, Central Railways had revealed that food items like 100 gram packets of Amul curd were purchased at Rs 14 crores for around 15,336 units (i.e. Rs 972 per unit). Similarly, refined oil had been purchased at Rs 253 a litre, and tur dal and moong dal were purchased for Rs 157 per kilogram -- which is several times higher than the existing market price.

""The GST Council has categorically decided to implement GST on July 1,"" the Finance Minister had said. Earlier, industry body Assocham and Civil Aviation Ministry had requested the Finance Ministry to defer the GST roll out. Both were of the view that the machinery to roll out GST from July 1 was not in place. WHAT IS GSTThe Goods and Services (GST) is an indirect taxation wherein most of the existing taxes will be merged into a single taxation system.In other words, the GST will put all taxes levied by state and Central government in one basket and merge them into a single-tax system, thus doing away with multiple taxation and promoting the concept of a common market for all.The GST Council approved a four-tier uniform tax slab of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent on goods and services, plus an additional cess on demerit goods such as luxury cars, aerated drinks and tobacco products.Food items will not attract any tax and have been kept in the zero-per cent slab. Central taxes such as Sales Tax, Excise Duty, and state taxes such as Value-added Tax (VAT), Entertainment Tax and Luxury Tax will be subsumed into the GST.

Still counting notes deposited after demonetisation: RBI Guv,"The Reserve Bank of India is still counting the demonetised currency returned to it and it also can?t say how much black money has been recovered, governor Urjit Patel has told a parliamentary panel.Patel, who appeared before a parliamentary standing committee on finance on Wednesday, failed to give an estimate of the fake currency recovered, sources said.In a sudden decision, the Modi government had on November 8 announced scrapping of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, taking out 86% of all cash from the economy, disrupting economic activity in Asia?s third-largest economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the move was aimed at weeding out black money and choking counterfeit currency that was being to fund terrorist activities.Patel couldn?t provide to the panel, chaired by Congress leader M Veerappa Moily, a date by which the Reserve Bank of India would come out with the exact amount of the money deposited.Prior to November 8, the currency in circulation was Rs 17.7 lakh crore. It now stands at Rs 15.4 lakh crore.On the day demonetisation was announced, 17,165 million pieces of Rs 500 notes and 6,858 million pieces of Rs 1,000 notes were in circulation, according to an SBI report.Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, one of the vocal critics of demonetisation, asked if the RBI would be able provide the details before May 2019, when the Modi government?s term ends.Patel told the panel the RBI was using 39 counting machines and had hired seven more machines. ?Even with some many machines, it is taking time as we also have to keep count of the fake notes. We have decided to buy some more counting machines,? sources quoted him as saying.The bank had cut staff holidays and they were working ?round the clock? except on Sundays to count the notes.Some panel members, including Biju Janata Dal?s Bhartruhari Mahtab, Samajwadi Party?s Naresh Agarwal, flagged concern over the recent farmer agitation in Madhya Pradesh and other states, saying the farm distress was reportedly linked to the unavailability of cash in rural India following demonetisation. Trinamool?s Saugata Ray alleged ?even now, rural bank branches are giving only Rs 1,000 if a farmer asks for Rs 5,000?, sources said.The RBI would give more cash to busy rural branches, Patel said.There was a 50-day window -- from November 9 to December 30 -- for the exchange of old notes at banks and post offices. After December 30, designated offices of the RBI accepted the scrapped currency till June 30.Indians who were abroad during the 50-day period were given a three-month grace period, till March 31, to deposit the old notes. In the case of NRIs, the deadline was June 30.Responding to a clutch of petitions, the Supreme Court on July 4 asked the government and the RBI to consider granting a window to those who couldn?t exchange old notes for ?genuine reasons?.",business,2852,60,70
"Detection of fake currency has risen 4,000% in 8 years","By Neelabh Srivastava New Delhi, Jun 14 (PTI) Counterfeit currency detection instances in the countrys banking channels have seen an all time increase in the last eight years at over 3.53 lakh instances, according to a latest government report. All banks, either public sector, private and foreign banks in the country, are mandated to report such instances to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under anti-money laundering law provisions. ""The number of counterfeit currency reports (CCRs) increased from a mere 8,580 in 2007-08 to 35,730 in 2008-09 and 3,53,837 in 2014-15,"" the report, accessed by PTI, said. However, the amount of fake currency detected has not been specified. CCR is defined as the usage of a forged or counterfeit currency note or bank note as genuine or where any forgery of a valuable security or a document has taken place during a cash transaction at a bank. As per the data complied since 2007-08, when the government first mandated the FIU to receive such reports under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) from banks, the year 2009-10 saw reportage of 1,27,781 CCR, in 2010-11 it was 2,51,448, in 2011-12 it was 3,27,382, in 2012-13 they were 3,62,371 and in 2013-14 a total of 3,01,804 such instances were reported. The data for 2010-11 to 2014-15 shows that the major chunk of these reports, at over 90 per cent, were filed by private Indian banks and a majority of them pertain to usage of fake Indian currency notes (FICN) and not any other valuable security as defined under the CCR terminology. ""The private Indian banks contribute majority of CCRs. The compliance levels of the public sector banks continued to be low despite the matter having been taken up with the RBI,"" the report said. It added that during the ""review"" of public sector banks on this issue, the best practices of private Indian banks in detection and reporting of counterfeit currency notes were highlighted. A senior Finance Ministry official put the figures in perspective: ""CCRs are meant to check the menace and extent of FICN entering the banking system which forms a very important part of the functioning of the economy. ""While the figures of the eight years, since the regime of reportage of such incidents first began, have shown an increasing trend, it is good that the banks are increasingly able to detect them and report to the FIU,"" the official said. The FIU under the Union finance ministry, acts as the national agency to provide financial intelligence to law enforcement agencies for safeguarding the economy from abuses of money laundering, terrorist financing and other offences, further disseminates this data to investigative agencies to ascertain the source of the FICN and undertake legal action under criminal laws aimed to check money laundering and black money. The report, however, did not talk about the results after the CCRs were handed over to probe agencies like the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and others. The report said the FIU, during 2014-15 also received a total of 58,646 suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from all types of banks, financial institutions like insurance companies, intermediaries like stock brokers and additional non-financial businesses and professions like casinos and private locker operators. The STRs in the latest data compiled year of 2014-15 were the second highest after 61,953 such reports were received by the FIU in 2013-14. A suspicious transaction, under PMLA, is defined as any transaction that either indicates that it has been made in circumstances of unusual or unjustified complexity or appears to have no economic rationale or bonafide purpose. The definition is also applicable to those transactions that give rise to a reasonable ground of suspicion that it may involve financing of the activities relating to terrorism. As per data, the maximum STRs are reported to the FIU by banks as compared to any other financial intermediary mandated to do so in the country. Acting on these STRs, the report said, ""the CBDT (Income Tax Department) detected unaccounted income of Rs 4,471.65 crore while it seized assets worth Rs 65 crore, the Customs and Service Tax department detected tax evasion to the tune of Rs 21.59 crore and the Enforcement Directorate detected and seized proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs 25 crore during 2014-15."" The agency also received over 3.4 lakh cross-border wire transfer reports (CBWTR) during the said time period.",general,4497,54,70
?100 cr released for bridge twice the height of Qutub Minar,"The Delhi government has released Rs100 crore for the Signature Bridge project, which was hit by a fund crunch slowing down its last phase of construction.Delhi tourism minister Rajendra Gautam said, on Monday, that the finance department has sanctioned the amount after examining the contractor?s demand for an additional Rs250 crore. For the construction of the bridge, which was supposed to be ready for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a budget of Rs1,131 crore was sanctioned but till now Rs1,575 crore have been spent. This bridge was conceptualised by the Sheila Dikshit government in 2004. Gautam, who had inspected the bridge earlier, had written to the chief secretary, saying that the work should not go on beyond December 31, this year, under any circumstances.?This fresh infusion of funds will ensure that work, which had considerably slowed down, resumes. Around 92% of the project is completed. We might release more depending on the justification of the demand,? he said.Located over the Yamuna in Wazirabad, this bridge with a bow-shaped steel pylon of the bridge will be twice as high as the Qutub Minar. Being built on the lines of the London Bridge, it was meant to be showcased during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. In January, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had directed the authorities concerned to send to him a monthly progress report of the project.",politics,1371,60,70
China has vested interest in solving Kashmir issue: Media,"Due to its almost USD 50 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), China has a ""vested interest"" in acting as a mediator between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue, according to an article in a state-run daily. The article published in the Global Times, a publication of the ruling Communist Party of China, suggested Beijing's latent interest in playing a bigger role in the region. Claiming that China had mediated between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya refugees issue, the article said, ""China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, but that doesn't mean Beijing can turn a deaf ear to the demands of Chinese enterprises in protecting their overseas investments."" ""Given the massive investment that China has made in countries along the One Belt, One Road, China now has a vested interest in helping resolve regional conflicts including the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan"", it said. China's recent mediation between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya issue shows the increased ability of Beijing in resolving conflicts beyond its borders to maintain regional stability, the article said. CHINA AT THE CENTRE OF REGIONAL POWER SHIFT""China has been at the centre of a regional power shift, thus the country now needs to learn how to act as a stabilising force and conflict mediator in the region"", it said. There is so much to learn for China about how to play its role as a regional power at a time when the country is witnessing a boom in outbound direct investment, the article said. ""For instance, while China has the capability to resolve conflicts through mediation given its increased economic influence, the nation needs to be very prudent in dealing with other big powers, India included, in the region,"" it said. ""In fact, mediating between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue would perhaps be one of the toughest challenges facing China in dealing with regional affairs to safeguard its overseas interests"", the article said. This is perhaps the first time that Chinese official media started floating Beijing's interest in playing a mediatory role to resolve the Kashmir issue. WHAT IS CHINA'S OFFICIAL STAND?China's official stand is that the Kashmir issue left over from history should be resolved between India and Pakistan, though Beijing has been stepping up its investments in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While China in the past has played down reports of the presence of its troops in PoK, saying that they were there to deliver humanitarian assistance, its USD 46 billion China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) through the disputed Gilgit and Baltistan region increased its involvement in the disputed areas. The CPEC project will link the Pakistani city of Gwadar to China's Xinjiang via a vast network of highways and railways. India has protested to China over the CPEC and is yet to name an official delegation to take part in a summit of the Belt and Road initiative, of which CPEC is a part. The summit is to be held from May 14-15. Chinese official media also referred to last month's participation of Chinese troops for the first time in the Pakistan Day parade as a sign of the Chinese military playing a role in regional stability.(WITH INPUTS FROM PTI)Also read | Is China using its One Belt One Road initiative as an alibi to meddle in Kashmir dispute?Also read | Pakistan using proxies in Jammu and Kashmir for its foreign policy goals: Top US experts",general,3587,57,70

"SBI merger was a mass mission, says Arundhati Bhattacharya","Mumbai, Apr 3 (PTI) State Bank of India today ruled out a spike in bad loans following the mega merger that has catapulted the countrys largest lender into the top 50 globally with close to USD 500 billion balancesheet. ""Increase in NPAs is not necessary (post-merger) as associate banks had a number of accounts which were standard, but those were already NPAs with us. So, to that extent, those things have been put on the same platform,"" Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters here today. Effective April 1, the five associate banks -- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Travancore -- as well as Bharatiya Mahila Bank have been merged with SBI, creating a global banking behemoth. She said the bank has undertaken an asset quality review (AQR) on its own, apart from the one mandated by the Reserve Bank in December 2015, in respect of all the common accounts as part of the merger process. ""All the stressed assets to the extent possible, where we had common exposures, are aligned now. We had taken more than Rs 8,600 crore of additional provisions,"" she added. ""We believe that even though numbers look bigger, we now have much better ability to resolve them as the day we resolve our NPAs, those will also get resolved.

"HC bars debt-ridden man from going out, cites Mallya example","Vijay Mallya's financial fraud and eventual escape from the law enforcement has invariably become a lesson for many. Investors, today, will think thoroughly before investing their money as the courts have now taken cognizance of the gravity of such crimes and have began taking stern decisions to avoid similar frauds.The Karnataka High Court today refused to give the passport of the promoters of S Kumar's a company owned by Nitin Shambhu Kumar Kasliwal. Promoter Kasliwal had borrowed an amount close to Rs 6,500 crore from various banks.The banks that have sought recovery from Kasliwal include Punjab National Bank, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, Central Bank, Jammu Kashmir Bank, Indian Bank and IDBI Bank.Kasliwal appealed before the court to travel abroad, however, it seems the Mallya incident have influenced the decision making of the court which refused to handover the passport.Kasliwal was declared a wilful defaulter by UCO bank and in December 2016, the Debts Recovery Tribunal had seized his passport after the notification.The fear expressed by the prosecution was that of they let him to travel abroad, Kasliwal may escape like Mallya did and they will not be able to recover their debts.According to the advocate representing the banks, Kasliwal owes Rs 6,494 crore as in July 2015.NO RIGHT TO IMPOUND KASLIWALKasliwal's advocate argued in court saying that the DRT had no right to impound the passport and that Kasliwal was allowed to travel abroad earlier too. The advocate added that the DRT and their client had complied with all the conditions imposed on him.S Kumar's has been a big clothing brand whose fabric was being produced in factories located in Mysuru in Karnataka and Dewas in Madhya Pradesh. The company ran into losses during the economic slowdown and the banks took the legal route to recover the debts that Kasliwal owed.S Kumar's had introduced the famous Scottish fabric brand Reid and Taylor in India of which Amitabh Bachchan was the brand ambassador.

'Virgin' now corrected to 'Unmarried' in IGIMS' form,"The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna amended its marital declaration form on Thursday, replacing the word ?virgin? with ?unmarried? after controversy.Until now, new recruits to the super-specialty medical institute in the state capital were required to declare if they were bachelors, widowers or virgins.IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said institute director Dr NR Biswas held a meeting on Thursday morning before directing that the word ?virgin? on the marital declaration form be immediately replaced with ?unmarried?. Dr Biswas had just returned after a four-day leave of absence.Earlier, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey had ended up redefining the very meaning of virginity in his attempts to justify the awkward phrasing of the question in the form. Following a public furore over the document on Wednesday, the minister told news channels that there was nothing wrong with using the word ?virgin? because it simply meant ?kanya? or ?kunwari? ? which means an unmarried girl.Pandey had joined the cabinet just three days ago.Sources said the chief minister?s office had also taken cognizance of the issue, and asked for a copy of the form.

National bad bank is not a bad idea: HDFC Bank's Aditya Puri,"Mumbai, Feb 17 (PTI) Aditya Puri, Managing Director and Chief Executive of the second largest private lender HDFC Bank, today backed the idea of setting up a national bad bank, saying anything that can help resolve the perennial bad loans problem is welcome. ""I dont think a national bad bank is a bad idea. The Government and the regulators are coming up with various discussions as to how solve the issue relating to NPAs and that is necessary so that the banking system has the ability to do more. ""Bad bank is one of the ideas being discussed, there are other ideas like the Bankruptcy Code which should also help, we bankers are also working (on tacking NPA issue),"" Puri told a panel discussion at the concluding day of the three-day annual Nasscom leadership forum here. It can be noted that almost 20 per cent of the banking assets are stressed with the NPAs alone topping 13.5 per cent as of the September quarter. While more than 70 per cent of the system are with the state-run banks, over 90 per cent of the stressed assets with them, leaving them starved of growth capital. While its banks are starved of cash, the Government finances are not adequate to recapitalise them which was visible from the paltry Rs 10,000 crore for capital infusion into 24 state-run banks in the Budget 2018. In fiscal 2017 and the previous year, the Government infused Rs 25,000 crore each in to these banks, while their demand is at least Rs 91,000 crore between the next two fiscal years, as per an India Ratings estimate in the core tier I capital alone to meet the stringent Basel 3 capital norms. For the system as a whole between fiscal 2015 and 2019, the banks need more than Rs 3.9 trillion for the banks to meet the Basel III capital norms.

"Culture clash threatens Air France-KLM alliance, says report","A clash of national cultures and an inability to understand each other?s languages threatens to make the merged Air France-KLM group of airlines unmanageable, according to a leaked internal company report.French staff in the Franco-Dutch company complain their colleagues from the Netherlands are money-grubbing, while the Dutch regard the Air France staff as aloof, according to the report.Among the petty grievances, there is irritation that a KLM employee working in Paris is charged ?10 for lunch in the canteen, while an Air France colleague pays only ?4.Such is the state of relations, according to the 100-page report, compiled by unions acting for staff within the group, that there are fears for the company?s future. ?One questions whether the alliance can survive given the long-standing mutual incomprehension between the Dutch and French camps within the group,? one researcher was quoted as writing.The embarrassing insight into the company emerged after a French and a Dutch researcher spoke to nearly 50 managers at the airline, which was formed 13 years ago through the merger of its constituent airlines.?The French have the impression that the Dutch think only of money and are always ready to fight for profit. They are not afraid of anything,? the researchers reported.?The Dutch think that the French are attached to a hierarchy and political interests which are not necessarily the same as the interests of the company ? The extent to which employees are disillusioned is shocking. People are pessimistic, frustrated and burnt out because they feel that this is not listened to.?Air France managers are also said to feel that they look more at what is best for the whole company, while KLM managers only worry about what is good for KLM. Air France staff accuse KLM managers of thinking that they are more professional and ?super cool?, the report leaked to a Dutch broadcaster says.KLM managers, on the other hand, think that their French colleagues only worry about keeping jobs at Air France.

Malana's deity 'orders' closure of joints and guest houses,"Malana village in Himachal Pradesh, famous for its premium quality hashish, has just become off limits for tourists after its presiding deity Jamlu ?ordered? the closure of all guest houses and restaurants ?to protect? local culture and traditions.The deity?s diktat came on the heels of a meeting of the village?s own ?parliament? which concluded that outsiders thronging their village were a threat to their culture. The ?parliament? comprises an upper house called Jayeshthang and a lower house called Kanishthang. Villagers invoked Jamlu after the ?parliament? met. Villagers in Malana invoke Jamlu through a chosen medium ? in this case an oracle, who then conveys to them what the deity ?said.? Devotes believe Jamlu responds to all kinds of queries.?The deity did not want any of the villagers to rent out their property for running guest houses and restaurants. He has forbidden everyone from doing this, and those violating his orders will have to bear the brunt of his curse,? Malana panchayat pradhan Bhagi Ram told HT on the phone.Corroborating the development, district tourism officer in Kullu, Rajnish Gautam, said, ?I learnt that the deity has forbidden the villagers from running guest houses.? The restaurants and guest houses have to be registered with state government?s tourism department?s office in Kullu. There are nearly a dozen guest houses in the village with a population of 4700. Inhabitants of Malana known as the Malanis have a distinctive dialect called Kanashi, which is different from the others spoken in the Kullu region. Malana is an isolated village in the Parvati Valley and its reclusive inhabitants are said to be descendants of soldiers of Alexander?s army.A few months back, the village had banned photography because villagers felt that visitors clicking pictures were portraying Malana as a hub of narco-tourism. ?It?s unfortunate that cannabis trade has defamed our village. People of this village have their own culture and beliefs,? said Mahila Mandal pradhan Ram Kali, adding that they have been struggling to shed this cannabis tag.Vivek Mohan, winner of a national award for his critically acclaimed documentary on Malana, said, ?Malana managed to preserve its culture due to two factors: devotion to Devta Jamlu and its geographical isolation. Now both are getting diluted due to the Malana hydro project and mobile telephony. Their devotion to the devta is keeping them together, but how long will it be before it becomes a cosmetic ritual.?Traditionally, inhabitants of this land-locked village used to make baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. But in the late 1980s, the visiting foreigners taught the villagers to extract the intoxicating resin from cannabis. Though successive governments have tried to wean the villagers away from narcotic trade, there is no other cash crop to rival cannabis in Malana.

Eight public libraries built with Swaraj fund inaugurated,"Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will inaugurate eight public libraries constructed under the Swaraj Fund in the Karawal Nagar assembly constituency in north east Delhi on Sunday. These libraries are unique in their own way as they have been put together from the citizen local area development fund, or Swaraj fund, and were taken up after people chose them as priority projects in mohalla sabhas conducted in various assembly constituencies last year. Though the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has started working on projects promised during the Mohalla Sabhas, the fate of Swaraj fund for the current fiscal (2016-17) itself hangs in balance.Officials say that the constitution of mohalla sabhas and creating a project management unit under it are yet to get approval from the Lieutenant Governor. The fate of Rs 350 crore, allocated under Swaraj fund in the annual budget, hence, by the AAP government remains unclear. With only three months left in the current fiscal, officials said they were not sure if funds will be utilised at all this year.?The process of holding mohalla sabhas across the city and then implementing the projects chosen as priority is a long-drawn one. Eight public libraries, construction of which were decided in mohalla sabhas in Karawal Nagar assembly constituency on a pilot basis last fiscal (2015-16), will be inaugurated on Sunday. Any delay in approval could lead to lapse of funds this year,? said a senior revenue department official. In June, the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet had cleared a proposal to constitute 2,972 mohalla sabhas, besides creating a project management unit (PMU) called Mission Swaraj to co-ordinate the entire project. Both proposals were then sent to the L-G for his approval. Mohalla sabhas were conducted in 11 assembly segments including Karawal Nagar in May last year. Development works worth R 50 lakh in each of the 11 assembly segment were decided in these meetings. Karwal Nagar MLA and water minister Kapil Mishra said the government had not lost hope on holding such sabhas before the end of this fiscal. ?The initiative is a unique step to ensure citizen participation in governance. It would be for the first time that eight libraries in an assembly segment are coming up, which was actually decided by area residents themselves. Even if the L-G clears the approval now, the government will at least hold these sabhas,? said Mishra.",general,2399,58,70

It is the fourth choice of venue after three other options pulled out of the controversial event. Former gang member and event organiser Tokomauri Hoterene said a spate of gang killings in Northland on the North Island in 2016 had brought gang tensions in his region to new highs. There are ten different gangs in Northland and Hoterene said 80% of the violence is related to disputes over drugs. Hoterene and his fellow organisers hope some of the lingering anger can be punched out in the boxing ring, but its been a challenge to get venues and some members of the community on board. ?As soon as anybody hear?s gang ? boom ? shuts down.

Man throws 3-year-old daughter in canal to become 'tantrik',"A three-year-old girl who had gone missing on July 11, was thrown into a canal by her father to become a tantrik, police have claimed. The child?s body was recovered from the canal in Faridabad the next day.The police had registered a case of kidnapping when Dheeraj Kumar of Pyali Chowk area under the Kotwali police station informed the police control room (PCR)?that his daughter had been kidnapped. Kumar told the police that he had taken his daughter to a nearby market on a scooter and later dropped her near home. He claimed that she had gone missing after this. The CCTV footage showed the man leaving with his daughter and returning alone.?We scanned CCTV footage in the area and got suspicious about him,? a police official investigating the case said. ?In the footage the girl was not with him when he returned. When we confronted him, he confessed to his crime,? the official said.He was arrested and produced in a court on Thursday which remanded him to one-day police custody. ?During questioning, Dheeraj said he wanted to get rid of his daughter Sonakshi to become a tantrik,? the police said. ?We sought his one-day police remand to know who advised him to take this step,? Ram Nath, in-charge, NIT-2 police post, said.Police said that Dheeraj Kumar (centre, sitting) confessed his crime when they quizzed him.

Actor Dileep's bail plea rejected in actress abduction case,"The Angamaly (Kochi) judicial magistrate court on Saturday turned down Malayalam superstar Dileep?s bail plea and remanded him in judicial custody till July 25.Dileep was arrested last week in connection with the abduction and rape of a popular actress four months ago. He is the eleventh accused in the case.The public prosecutor opposed the superstar?s bail application, stating that he could use his clout to influence witnesses and weaken the ongoing investigation. The prosecution also referred to an ongoing pro-Dileep social media campaign to secure his release.However, the embattled actor?s counsel ? Ram Kumar ? claimed the actor has been falsely implicated in the case and the investigation team was ?busy fabricating evidence against him?. He also submitted two mobile phones used by the actor for further tests.Dileep was later taken to the Aluva sub-jail. He is expected to move the high court on Monday.The 31-year-old actress was returning from a film shoot when she was abducted by a gang of criminals and sexually assaulted in a moving car over a period of three hours on February 17.

Rio 2016 termed as the most perfect imperfect Games,"The Rio de Janeiro Olympics may not have been perfect but organisers exceeded expectations given the political and economic situation in the South American country, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Tuesday.Rio, the first Olympic host city on the continent, had to grapple with a protracted political crisis, the worst recession in more than 80 years and a string of organisational problems due to a lack of cash.The run-up to the Games was an obstacle course for local organisers and the IOC had to put up hundreds of millions of dollars of its eventual contribution before the start of the Olympics to help out.The Games' anti-doping programme was also affected by a lack of funding amid a widening Russian drugs scandal while venues were hit by problems including water quality in pools and a virtual absence of branding around the Olympic park due to issues with banner suppliers.""From an operational point of view everything worked,"" the IOC's Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi told reporters. ""Were they perfect? No.""But with the results we can really take our hat off (to Rio organisers). It is amazing what they delivered considering their standpoint,"" he said.Dubi said the IOC was satisfied with the Rio Games especially with athletes' performances that yielded 100 world and Olympic records and brought several countries their first medals and with global coverage which beat past records.""We are right on target when you consider the money that was spent for these Games,"" Dubi said.Rio was awarded the Games in 2009 amid Brazil's booming economy at the time and a different set of expectations by the IOC before the political crisis and the sharp financial downturn changed organisers' plans.",sports,1736,51,70

However, Micromax said the impact on its sales was lower than that on the industry. ""Our internal data suggests that the effect happening is playing out at two different levels. So sure, consumer sales are down. They are down 25-30 per cent. Actually, we guys have got hit far more on the online front because of cash on delivery. But overall, we are trending at 25-30 per cent decline in these 3-4 weeks and we think its a bit lower than industry,"" Micromax Chief Marketing Officer Shubhajit Sen said. He added that the impact on supply chain (distributors) has been around 15-18 per cent, in some cases it is as high as 60 per cent. Sen said ""post Diwali effect"" also had a bearing on the numbers. ""...part of it was post Diwali effect and was seen on the entire industry. While we cannot isolate the two, demonetisation had its share as well,"" a company spokesperson clarified later. According to industry experts, sales usually fall after Diwali by 10-15 per cent given that festive sales see a surge on offers and discounts. Sen said the situation is gradually returning to normal. ""Its not that the market collapsed, it has become a little difficult,"" he said, adding that the company is offering higher credits to distributors to help tide over the situation.

Canadian PM Justin Trudeau meets baby Justin Trudeau,"The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, came face to face with his namesake as he met the baby of Syrian refugees who was named in his honour.The meeting took place at the Calgary Stampede on Saturday, where two-month-old Justin Trudeau Adam Bilan slept happily as the prime minister briefly held him.The boy?s parents, Muhammad and Afraa Bilan, named him as a gesture of thanks to the country that offered them sanctuary.The family came to Canada from Damascus in February last year, after escaping the Syria?s war. Their son was born several months after their arrival in Alberta.In December 2015 Trudeau greeted 163 Syrian refugees in Toronto, as the country prepared for thousands more arrivals. Since then 40,081 refugees have settled in the country.This has not come without its challenges, and the families who have been resettled have talked about the difficulties of finding work and learning English or French. Settlement agencies launched workshops to help refugees cope with the anxiety and some criticised the federal government for not doing enough for refugees.Speaking last year, John McCallum, Canada?s minister for immigration, refugees and citizenship, said the government had increased funding for language training to address shortages across the country. He said that while Canada?s ambitious project to settle tens of thousands of refugees was not perfect, it had gone extremely well. ?And what makes me proud is not just that we got the job done, which we did ? but there is still more to do ? but really that if you compare Canada with other countries around the globe which are tending to close their doors to refugees, Canadians responded so overwhelmingly positively to the refugees.?",world,1717,52,70

Oxford University faces trial over Indian student's lawsuit,"From Aditi Khanna London, Jan 22 (PTI) Oxford University has been directed to face trial after an Indian-origin student sued the varsity for ""hopelessly bad"" and ""boring"" teaching which allegedly resulted in him getting a second class degree and in turn led to loss of earnings in his career as a lawyer. The world-famous university had applied to the High Court in London to dismiss the claim by Faiz Siddiqui but in an 18-page judgement by Justice Kerr last week the court ruled that Oxford does have a case to answer, The Sunday Times reported. Siddiqui, who studied modern history at Brasenose College at the university, accuses its staff of ""negligent"" teaching of his specialist subject course on Indian imperial history, which led to him getting a 2:1 back in 2000. The 38-year-olds barrister Roger Mallalieu had told the court that the problem came down to four of the seven staff teaching Asian history being on sabbatical leave at the same time during the 1999-2000 academic year. Siddiqui believes he could have had a high-flying career as an international commercial lawyer if he had not got lower grades and decided to take the legal route, which came to light last month. His legal team had singled out the ""boring"" standard of tuition that Siddiqui had received from David Washbrook, an expert on the history of southern India between the 18th and 20th centuries. Mallalieu claimed that the eminent historian?s teaching had suffered from the ""intolerable"" pressure of the staff shortages on the course. ""There is no personal criticism of Dr Washbrook. Our target is on the university?s back for allowing this to happen,"" Mallalieu told the court. Siddiqui, who trained as a solicitor after college, suffers from depression and insomnia, which he links to his ""disappointing examination results"". Oxford University had argued that the claim was baseless and should be struck out because of the over 16 years that had passed since Siddiqui graduated.",general,1964,59,70
Tree trunks emit greenhouse gas instead of storing it: Study,"Washington, Apr 3 (PTI) Tree trunks in upland forests actually emit methane rather than storing it, say scientists who claim to have found a new, previously unaccounted source of this powerful greenhouse gas. Researchers from University of Delaware (UD) in the US found that upland forest soils usually take up and store methane, but this effect can be counteracted by methane emissions from tree trunks. They tested a cluster of trees, soil and coarse woody debris (CWD) - dead wood lying on the forest floor in various stages of decomposition - to measure fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide. The team used a state-of-the-art greenhouse gas analyser based on laser absorption technology, called Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS). They visited the site over the course of one growing season - April to December. Researchers measured the carbon dioxide and methane fluxes of the soil, tree trunks and CWD to determine whether those three components were sources or sinks of these greenhouse gases. ""We believe our work can help fill in some gaps in methane budgets and environmental processes in global ecosystem models,"" said Rodrigo Vargas assistant professor in UD. ""What we have found in this study is that some coarse woody debris act kind of like the soil and consume methane while other pieces of coarse woody debris emit small amounts of methane, which is also what we saw with living tree trunks,"" said Daniel Warner of UD. ""The tree trunks constantly have low but detectable emissions of methane,"" said Vargas. ""Soils are providing an environmental service of sequestering this potent greenhouse gas, but the trunks are releasing methane equivalent to 4 per cent of what could be captured by CWD and soils at the ecosystem scale,"" he said.",science,1774,60,70

There will be a time when Virat Kohli will score and Steve Smith will not score runs. Steve Smith likes batting against India to be honest. Four hundreds on the 2014-15 series in Australia and then two hundreds here along with the 2015 World Cup semi-final hundred. He loves Indian bowling you have got to give him credit. His records phenomenal. 19 Test hundreds in just 53 Test matches that's a fantastic record.Rohan: India's intensity dropped in the final session of play on Day 1. Do you think that is because Kohli was not on the field?Ganguly: These are after thoughts to be honest. You have got to give credit to the way Maxwell and Smith batted.

Richa has also turned producer of regional films recently.The 30-year-old actor says it is unfair to give an actor the tag of an outsider. ? This stance is a cause of worry. With this, you are basically telling people, who are not born in the film fraternity, that they don?t have a chance. That?s not a good thing for the industry because then the talented ones will not come forward. If you give a chance to people, talent will come from all parts of India .

Pay ?96 crore for polluting Mumbai river: SC to civic bodies,"Two municipal bodies and an association of industries will have to pay Rs96 crore for polluting the Ulhas River in Thane, after the Supreme Court vacated a Bombay high court order that had put on hold the penalty.On July 5, the SC passed an order staying the HC judgement, which had put on hold a 2015 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. The NGT had asked the municipal bodies and association to pay the fine. The SC order, which was made public on Monday, effectively stays all previous orders of the HC in this matter.The SC said the civic bodies and the industries have the option of either filing a review in the NGT or taking the matter to the SC itself, within three weeks.In July 2015, the western bench of the NGT had passed a judgement indicting the Dombivli Industries Association (DBESA), Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation, Ambernath Municipal Council and the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation of polluting the Ulhas River with untreated effluents and raw sewage. The judgment imposed a penalty of Rs96 crore to restore the river and ordered that a time-bound revival plan be put in place.READ: Unfazed by censure, Maharashtra?s polluting factories make its rivers filthiest in IndiaThe matter came to light three years earlier in 2012, when NGO Vanashakti filed a petition with the NGT, asking it to direct the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to shut polluting industries discharging untreated waste into the Ulhas River, as it violates environment rules. Following the NGT order in July 2015, the government agencies moved the HC, which stayed the tribunal?s order of depositing the amount, and constituted another committee above the one formed by the tribunal.

Japan gets its first sumo wrestling grand champion in 18 yrs,"Japan?s long wait for a homegrown sumo grand champion has ended after Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to reach the ancient sport?s pinnacle in almost two decades.The 30-year-old became the sport?s 72nd yokozuna, or grand champion, after Japan?s sumo association approved his promotion on Wednesday in a move purists hope will mark the start of a challenge to years of dominance by overseas wrestlers.The last Japan-born wrestler to reach the top rank was Wakanohana in 1998.The 178kg Kisenosato ? who has been criticised for letting several tournament titles slip through his hands ? became a serious contender for promotion after winning the new year?s contest in Tokyo with a record of 14 victories and one defeat.At a ceremony at his stable on Wednesday morning, Kisenosato said he accepted his promotion ?with great humility?. He added: ?I will show devotion and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna.?In recent years sumo has been dominated by wrestlers from Mongolia, Hawaii and Samoa.Earlier this week, with his promotion all but a formality, Kisenosato told reporters that the rank of yokozuna came with a special responsibility. ?I feel grateful to all the people that have helped me,? said Kisenosato, who paid tribute to his late stable master, Naruto. ?If I had not met my former trainer I would not have got to where I have now,? he said. ?I have nothing but gratitude.?Kisenosato?s ascent to sumo?s summit did not come easily: his historic victory on Sunday came at the end of his 73rd tournament as a professional, which is more than it has taken any other wrestler since 1926 to reach the top rank.His addition to the yokozuna ranks is also expected to help improve sumo?s image, after a decade in which it has been rocked by a series of scandals, including bullying, drug taking and allegations of match fixing.Kisenosato joins three other wrestlers at the rank of yokozuna, all of whom were born in Mongolia: Kakuryu, Harumafuji and Hakuho. The latter is considered by many to be the greatest sumo wrestler of all time with 37 tournament titles.Foreign-born wrestlers? domination of sumo began with the 287kg Konishiki in the 1990s and continued into the next decade with the arrival of Asashoryu from Mongolia whose unpredictable behaviour outside the ring occasionally took the sheen off his brilliant performances inside it.",general,2363,60,70

"Atletico de Kolkata renamed to Aamar, Tomar Kolkata (ATK)","For Atletico de Kolkata (ATK) there is lots in a name. Or an acronym.So though Atletico Madrid won?t partner anymore, the Kolkata franchise of the Indian Super League (ISL) will continue to be known as ATK, said its principal owner Sanjiv Goenka.And would ATK continue to stand for what is was over the past three years? ?The name of the team is the name of the team and it is ATK. It can also stand for Aamar, Tomar Kolkata,? said Goenka. Translated from Bengali, that would mean the team for every Kolkatan.Speaking after the media conference where Goenka said this, a team official said it is premature to say that henceforth ATK would stand for something apart from what was coined three years ago after the La Liga giants came on board with a 25% stake in the ownership.?ATM (Atletico de Madrid) will sell their stake to me,? said Goenka. ?ATM and ATK have come to an agreement that they will not be part of ATK going forward. We?ve had a good relationship and we continue to be friends.?Goenka pointed out that the Madrid club hadn?t spent ?a penny? since joining in 2014. Atletico Madrid provided technical support including but not restricted to the coaching staff. They facilitated the pre-seasons in Madrid and were a major help in recruiting foreign players. The consistency of their imports played a major role in ATK winning two championships and being the semi-finalists in another.?We have competent technical team. Teddy (Sheringham) and Ashley (Westwood) bring a lot of experience, success and vision. And I hope we can fulfil expectation fans have from us. We have not let our fans down in the last three years,? said Goenka.?Babes compared to Bagan, EB?Goenka said even though the I-League and the ISL would be held simultaneously this season, there is no competition between ATK and Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in terms of garnering support. ?Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are great clubs with great legacies.

Philippine cops propose Muslim ID cards to combat terrorism,"Police from a region in the majority-Christian Philippines are considering issuing mandatory identification cards to thousands of Muslims living there ? a proposal Human Rights Watch condemned as ?collective punishment?.Authorities in Central Luzon, a region north of the capital, were quoted in local media as saying the policy was a counter-terrorism measure after Islamist militants took over a city hundreds of kilometres to the south on the island of Mindanao.The issue was discussed at a meeting between police, military and political figures and about 200 Muslim religious and community leaders at the provincial capitol building, according to news outlet Rappler.Chief Superintendent Aaron Aquino said the ID cards would allow authorities to identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists, Rappler reported.He said the system had already been implemented in the town of Paniqui ?and we want this to be replicated in all Muslim communities in the whole region for easy and efficient identification of our Muslim brothers and sisters?.Government forces have been hammering the city of Marawi in the south for nearly two months after local militant factions, who claim allegiance to Isis, rampaged through and took control.President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across Mindanao and had to apologise after blaming the residents of Marawi by saying they allowed Isis sympathisers to stay.Human Rights Watch said authorities were threatening to ?single out Muslims? with ID cards, violating the rights to equal protection of the law and freedom of movement.?Requiring Muslim-only IDs in response to a perceived failure of Muslims to prevent Islamist fighters from entering Marawi City is a form of collective punishment,? the New York-based advocacy group said in a statement.It added that reports of some Muslim leaders present at the meeting not rejecting outright the compulsory ID cards were ?irrelevant from a rights perspective? for the roughly 26,000 Muslims living in Central Luzon region. ?ID requirements for Muslims should be rejected outright.?",world,2083,59,70

Burglar arrested in Delhi helped the poor in his village,"In Delhi?s posh neighbourhoods, 27-year-old Irfan was a nameless and faceless burglar who broke into homes and made away with jewellery and other valuables. But, in his native village in Bihar?s Sitamarhi district, Irfan portrayed himself as a social worker who organised health camps and funded the weddings for poor families -- all to fuel his political ambitions.The police were on his trail ever since May this year when he allegedly stole gold and diamond jewellery worth lakhs of rupees from a house in New Friends Colony. He was, however, caught on a CCTV?camera and it did not take the investigators too long to identify him.Once his address was known, police raided his native village and nabbed him on July 6. When the police caught him, he was wearing a Rolex watch that was allegedly stolen from a house in Delhi. He had also recently bought a Honda Civic sedan after selling some stolen items.Within no time, his link to a dozen similar burglaries in the posh localities of south Delhi was revealed. Irfan lived in a rented house in Jamia Nagar.Police officers said Irfan alias Ujala was trying to earn the image of a ?Robin Hood? in his village to achieve a larger objective. ?Irfan harboured political ambitions. He was consciously creating that image to fuel his dreams,? said an investigator.When the police team traced him to his village earlier this month, residents of his village refused to accept that Irfan was a thief who would frequently steal from the rich residents of south Delhi. ?Villagers insisted that Irfan was a Delhi-based businessman who did social work in his village. They respectfully addressed him as Ujala Babu,? an investigator told Hindustan Times. Police said Irfan not only presented a ?larger than life? image in front of the villagers, he had also been lying to his girlfriend -- a woman who had apparently acted in a few Bhojpuri films.The police team had to convince the villagers by showing them CCTV footage of Irfan?s alleged involvement in thefts in New Friends Colony and Lajpat Nagar. A search of his property led to the seizure of stolen jewellery, watches and other valuables worth over Rs 20 lakh.Irfan was arrested from Bihar?s Pupri district July 6. (Picture: Sourced) While the police team too was initially taken aback by Irfan?s reputation, a further investigation into his life revealed that he harboured a dream to make it big in local politics and all his ?social work? was a conscious effort to realise his dream.?He would don kurta-pyjama and frequently upload pictures of his social work on Facebook. He was very conscious of his image and used to participate in the smallest of social activities in his village. He even used to discuss a foray into politics with the people he helped,? said the investigator.The larger portion of his loot, however, would fund his frequent pub visits, expensive cars, costly watches and clothes. ?He once offered to give Rs 10,000 at a bar in Delhi if the live performers there sang a song of his choice,? said Romil Baaniya, DCP (south-east).Irfan has told his interrogators that he would never wear shoes or slippers while committing the burglaries that mostly involved breaking into houses through doors or windows of houses locked from outside. ?He believed that if he would walk barefoot, he would be able to steal without alerting anyone,? said an officer.(This story has been updated with details)Read: He sold momos, dreamt of Audi: How Delhi murder suspect took shortcut to luxury",general,3508,56,70

Delhi Metro's upcoming stations to get art panels,"Life-size artworks, glossy walls and a unique ?honeycomb? design for ventilation will be featured at stations of Delhi Metro?s upcoming new corridors ? Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar) and Magenta Line (Botanical Garden to Janakpuri West). The stations at these two corridors will have their interiors covered completely in artworks that are a combination of paintings and photographs. These artworks are being reproduced on toughened glass so that walls inside the stations have a glossy effect ? a departure from the pale yellow and grey walls of the existing stations that have no visual appeal.First such artwork was installed at the Bhikaji Cama Place station on the Pink Line this week. Next in line is the Lajpat Nagar station. Officials said each station will get 26 to 37 artworks. Beside these two, nine more stations on this 59-km-long line will display original works of artists from across the country. These stations are Shalimar Bagh, Netaji Subhash Place, Naraina, Sarojini Nagar, INA, South Extension, Vinoba Puri, Ashram and Hazrat Nizamuddin.Until now, most of the existing artworks are installed at the underground stations. However, on the new lines, the focus is to improve the look of the elevated corridors. ?Phase 3 stations will have a different and fresh look with bright colours. The aim is to fill most of the interior walls at the concourse levels with paintings and photographs,? a metro official said.On the Magenta Line, the stations have been re-designed where instead of the traditional walls and windows, the concourse and platforms will be made of cemented honeycomb design for enhanced ventilation. ?The station will be covered with jaali-like walls to allow more light and ventilation into the concourse. The entry stairs and concourse to platform stairs will have perforated metal sheet cladding which will give a sense of security to the commuters,? the official added.While paintings and photographs are being digitally printed on glass which will be fixed as panels on walls, all of them are also fireproof. ?For the first time, DMRC invited applications from interested artists to send their original works. In response, 654 images were received from 50 artists across India.

US House approves new sanctions against Russia,"The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday to approve new sanctions on Russia, setting up a potential showdown with the White House.By a 419-3 vote, the House approved a bill to that would levy new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It combines new measures targeting Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, as well as provisions intended to curb North Korea?s nuclear weapons program and Iranian militarism.Only three libertarian-leaning Republicans ? Justin Amash of Michigan, Tom Massie of Kentucky and Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee ? voted against the bill in the House.The bill had been bogged down in controversy in recent weeks over objections from the Trump administration. The White House has been opposed to a provision in the bill that requires congressional approval for any attempt by the president to lift the sanctions on Russia.An earlier Senate version of the bill passed 98-2, but was only aimed at Russia and Iran. It did not include the measures against North Korea, which are now in the House bill. The latest bill must now return to the Senate, where it is expected to pass easily, before it is sent to Trump.Despite the White House?s opposition to the bill, it is likely to become law. Even if Trump decides to veto the legislation, it has already passed both chambers by veto-proof margins.In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that ?while the President supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the President?s desk?.The legislation passed the House the same day Trump?s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spoke to the House intelligence committee about the Trump campaign?s ties to Russia. Russian interference in the 2016 election is the subject of multiple investigations ? including one by special counsel Robert Mueller ? as well as committees on Capitol Hill, and questions have been raised in particular about allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has vigorously denied the suggestion that there was any collusion and has repeatedly called the investigations into Russia?s role in the election ?a witch hunt?.",general,2251,46,70

President Donald Trump has accused India and other countries of trying to extract ""billions and billions and billions"" of dollars in foreign aid from the developed world to sign up for the climate accord.MODI'S DISCUSSIONS WITH TRUMPIn spite of the difference on some issues, Modi's discussions with Trump are likely to find a common approach on matters related to South Asia, particularly the rise in infiltration from the neighbouring Pakistan, terrorism and India's case for a seat at the nuclear supplier's group. Modi has reiterated India's support to the Paris agreement and said he is willing to go further than what has been committed under the Paris accord.Both the leaders will hold discussions on taking the bilateral ties to a new level, convergence of strategic interests in South Asia, joint effort in fighting terrorism, trade and specifically the vexed issue of H-1B temporary visa, the biggest concern for New Delhi.Moreover, US National Security Adviser (NSA) Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster has re-affirmed India's position as the US' ""major defence partner"" during talks with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Lieutenant General McMaster had discussed bilateral ties, situation in the South Asian region including Afghanistan and Pakistan with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his April visit.Under the previous administration, Prime Minister Modi had a record eight meetings with former US President Barack Obama.On the US executive order on H-1B visas, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reportedly hit back at the United States on the H-1B visa issue and said that their companies in India will also be affected. She has said that it is not only the Indian companies which will get affected but also the US companies who earn profits which go to their economy.(With inputs from ANI)Also Read:India leading polluter, says US President Donald Trump while pulling out of Paris climate accordNarendra Modi in Paris: Climate deal shared legacy of world, article of faith for India",general,2558,59,70

A significant number of people have signed it and we want to show the authorities that this matter is crucial to the public and needs attention,? Bhagat told Hindustan Times.Environment activists have already raised concerns and said that more than 15,000 trees have already been felled in the Capital over the last three years. While more than 6,000 were cut in 2014-15, around 4,600 and 4,700 trees were felled in 2015-16 and 2016-17.The petition on change.org says that tree felling will be done right in the heart of the city with several schools, hospitals and residential areas in the vicinity. ?These areas, along with the rest of Delhi-NCR, will suffer from the resulting pollution, that will only worsen.

EasyJet passengers stranded in Greece due to mating turtles,"Scores of easyJet passengers were stranded on the Greek island of Zakynthos (also known as Zante) after their plane developed technical difficulties and a replacement aircraft was prevented from flying in because of mating turtles. Passengers expressed fury at easyJet?s lack of communication and ?incredibly bad? handling of the delay, which began on Sunday afternoon. Some travellers, who did not book on to other flights, were only able to make it home on Tuesday. A fault with a wing flap was announced by the captain soon after passengers boarded the flight to Gatwick at around 3pm on Sunday, and there was no communication for another hour. Despite being told the problem would be resolved in 20 minutes, passengers were soon asked to disembark. They were forced to wait through ?hours of nothingness,? according to Rebecca Morris, 39, who was travelling with her husband and two small children. She described the facilities at Zakynthos airport as ?basic? and said there was no help or guidance from easyJet apart from the odd automated text message. ?There was no food or refreshments and there was no representative from easyJet,? Morris said. She said that while her family?s travel agents helped them find accommodation and taxis, other passengers were left to ?fend for themselves?. A similar process was repeated on Monday. The airline said the night curfew ? apparently in place because of vulnerable loggerhead turtles breeding nearby ? had prevented an alternative aircraft being sent out. The sea turtle breeding season is well under way in Zakynthos. According to Archelon, a group dedicated in protecting sea turtles in Greece, late June to early July see the highest levels of spawning. The group has recorded 500 nests on the island so far, but that is fewer than in previous years. EasyJet later apologised for the delay. A spokesman said: ?Unfortunately easyJet was unable to operate flight EZY8746 from Zante to London Gatwick on Sunday 30 July due to a technical fault with the aircraft and had to delay the flight overnight. ?Engineers were immediately dispatched to Zante and believed that the technical issue was rectified yesterday, however it then reoccurred before boarding which meant the flight could not operate. The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and we will only operate if it is safe to do so. ?We do all possible to try and minimise delays and as such planned to send a replacement aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the night curfew rule at the airport, we were unable to get the replacement aircraft into the airport. The flight departed Zante and arrived at London Gatwick today. ?Around a quarter of passengers travelled on flights with alternative carriers yesterday afternoon. Passengers have been provided with hotel accommodation and expenses in line with EU261 regulations and will also be entitled to EU261 compensation.?",world,2906,59,70
Maldivian Opposition blocked from entering Parliament,"The Maldivian opposition said that the military locked down parliament on Monday on the orders of the country?s president in a bid to prevent lawmakers from taking part in a vote to impeach the parliamentary speaker.The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party said that on the orders of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom, the gates of the parliament were padlocked by members of the armed forces on Monday morning and lawmakers ?were forcibly prevented from entering the parliamentary compound.?In a statement, the opposition party called Yameen?s action ?desperate, illegal and unconstitutional.?There was no immediate comment from the government. The government spokesmen could not be reached by telephone.A no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed was scheduled to be taken up on Monday. The opposition says the motion has gained the support of 45 lawmakers in the 85-member house. However, an uncertainty arose when the election commission announced last week that the four members who supported the motion had lost their seats because they left the ruling party.The motion was considered a severe blow to Yameen, whose control over parliament was threatened by a new understanding between the Maldives? former strongman and its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed. The Maldivian Democratic Party routed Yameen?s party in local council elections earlier this year.A similar opposition bid to oust the speaker was thwarted in March when the government defeated it by 48 votes, with none opposing. At the time, opposition lawmakers were either evicted or walked out from a vote on ousting the speaker following a dispute over problems with the electronic voting system.The coalition?s plan to wrest the parliamentary majority was aimed at reforming the judiciary, elections commission and other bodies perceived as being partial toward Yameen.In March, Nasheed and former strongman Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and two other parties signed an agreement to form an opposition alliance.Maumoon runs a rival faction within the Progressive Party of Maldives, which is led by the current president, his half-brother.Nasheed was jailed in 2015 for 13 years for ordering the arrest of a senior judge when he was president in 2012.However, he traveled to Britain last year on medical leave and received asylum there. Three other leading politicians have also been jailed after trials criticized internationally for a lack of due process. Yameen is accused of rolling back many of the democratic gains since the Maldives became a multiparty democracy in 2008.",politics,2582,54,70

We haven't finalised the script of Manmohan biopic yet: Kher,"Anupam Kher's look as former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for The Accidental Prime Minister may have grabbed attention and sparked discussions, but the veteran actor says it's too early for him to comment on the film as they are yet to even lock the script.An announcement that a film on Sanjaya Baru's controversial book, The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh, is under works, sparked a buzz about what to expect.Baru, who was media adviser to Manmohan Singh from May 2004 to August 2008, had in his 2014 book controversially depicted his former boss as not being in full control of his own cabinet, and being subservient to Congress President Sonia Gandhi.A first look into the project was a black and white poster showing the side profile of Anupam, dressed as Manmohan Singh -- complete with a white beard and turban -- and the focus was more on the silhouette of a woman -- presumably Congress President Sonia Gandhi -- standing in the corridor of Parliament House.Given that Anupam wears his political ideology on his sleeve, it would be interesting to see how he will portray Manmohan Singh in the film.Asked about it, the actor told IANS: ""It's too early to talk about it. We have not even finalized the script. They (the makers) wanted to announce the film, so we just worked on that. The shooting is in late December.""""The film is based on a book, but the screenplay by Hansal Mehta has to be given to me.

"I-T dept unearths ?1,550 cr black money from fraud entries","operators, hawala dealers New Delhi, Jan 16 (PTI) The Income Tax department today said it has unearthed a black money racket of over Rs 1,550 crore and a maze of shell firms and entities, perpetrated by entry operators and hawala dealers in the wake of demonetisation. An analysis report prepared by the department, also accessed by PTI, said this particular black money generation modus operandi is led by a group of hawala dealers in the national capital who illegally routed funds worth Rs 930 crore post November 8. In another case in Delhi, the taxman detected entry operators trying to launder Rs 200 crore stash funds using 80 accounts. ""Similarly, in a bank branch in Noida, investigations are on into deposits in more than 100 bank accounts that were used to laundering more than Rs 200 crore,"" the report said. The tax departments action on such entry operators or hawala dealers in cities like Kolkata, Gurgaon, Charkhi Dadri and Chitradurga in Karnataka led the taxman unearthing laundering of cash to the tune of Rs 200 crore. A case in Bihars Gaya was similarly detected, the report said, where a person was allegedly trying to laundering Rs 13 crore of a Delhi-based entity. The taxman put freeze orders on two bank accounts used for this purpose in Gaya, it said. They added that the total amount involved in these prominent cases is over Rs 1,550 crore even as many more cases are still in the probe process. ""The modus operandi followed is the same across the country. Cash is deposited in bank accounts of paper companies or accounts fraudulently and immediately transferred through RTGS to other similar fraudulent accounts.",general,1645,58,70

Moti Bagh rape: Constable held for misusing Home Min sticker,"Delhi Police arrested a CISF head constable for allegedly ?misusing? a Union home ministry sticker that was found on a car in which a 20-year-old woman was allegedly raped by a driver in Moti Bagh on Wednesday.Police said when investigation into the rape case was on, an agriculture ministry official sent a complaint, accusing CISF head constable Omkar Singh of misusing the sticker entrusted to him by the ministry.Singh had reportedly passed on the sticker to his son, Mohit Pawar ? the owner of the car in which the woman was allegedly raped. Pawar used the sticker to avoid paying toll and for free parking.Sources said Pawar had blackened the validity date on the sticker and illegally used his car as a cab. Since the car had an MHA sticker on the windshield, it was not stopped at barricades or flagged down by traffic cops.Read: Woman allegedly raped in car in Delhi?s Moti Bagh area, accused arrestedThe CISF initiated a departmental probe against Singh and said action would be taken against him. He is posted at the motor transport department of the force.?The sticker was issued to Singh to give him access to Krishi Bhavan for official reasons. After the sticker?s validity ended, Singh did not return it to the ministry and instead blurred out the portion where its validity was mentioned. His son kept using the sticker as a pass at many places to avoid paying toll tax. On top of that, he hired a driver and was using his private car for commercial purposes,? a senior police officer said.?Pawar had been using the car to earn extra money for the past two years. He had hired the driver, Avneesh, two months ago,? he added.Police said Pawar will be questioned in the case. ?We have registered a case of criminal breach of trust against Singh and he has been arrested. He was later let out on bail,? said DCP (south) Ishwar Singh.Meanwhile, the arrested driver, Avneesh, has been sent to judicial custody. During questioning, Avneesh has reportedly told the police that he had helped the woman by giving her a blanket and allowing her to sleep inside his car for the night as she did not wish to return home. The woman, however, told the police that she was confined in the car by the driver, who then allegedly raped her. ?Initially Avneesh was in denial but on sustained interrogation he confessed to the crime.

"77 votes in Prez polls invalid due to circles, dots, commas","Dots and inverted commas have come to confound political parties, who are seeking to identify rebels during the 2017 presidential poll. These led to the rejection of votes by 21 MPs and 56 MLAs, triggering much curiosity and concern among parties.These 77 votes, with a value of 20,942, might be inconsequential to the outcome: NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind romped home with a margin of 3.67 lakh (in terms of value of votes). But there is no full stop in politics, as then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said after the UPA?s victory in 2009.Both the NDA and the opposition camps are anxious to know how many of the 77 invalid votes were a result of inadvertent errors and how many were by design. Over a hundred legislators were estimated to have cross-voted in valid votes.Those involved in the counting of votes on July 20 told HT that invalid ones were due to dots, inverted commas, circles and slants that electors erroneously used on their ballot papers. They were supposed to express their first preference simply with a numeral 1 ? second preference was unnecessary in a bipolar contest?in the box against the name of Kovind or Meira Kumar, the opposition parties? nominee.A Congress MLA from Haryana wrote 1. (numeral with a period-mark) rendering his vote invalid. Most of the 77 legislators made the same mistake, said those involved in counting.The second most common error was ?1?. Some put a circle around the numeric. The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted ?by about 30 to 40 degrees? and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later. One of the MLAs wrote 1 over Meira Kumar?s name.Given that legislators were clearly informed about the dos and don?ts, such errors were unexpected. Many of them could be inadvertent and a result of sheer habit but the rules set by the poll watchdog were not to be bent.Senior BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab recalled one such instance in 2012 presidential poll in which he was the counting agent for PA Sangma. A Congress MLA from Odisha decided to go by his conscience?permitted in presidential polls where there is no party whip ? and voted for Sangma. He used Oriya numeral P and not E for 1. Although both are used for 1, his vote was rejected after the Congress objected to it.The list of possible errors is long. According to Anoop Mishra, secretary general of the Lok Sabha and the Returning Officer for the presidential poll, any of these can lead a vote invalid: Writing the same preference number outside both candidate?s names, putting a tick mark, or writing outside the box. ?Votes can also be declared invalid if there are any other marks, which are not required and which can later identify the voter. These can even be a dot, a line or even a wrong-coloured ink,? he told HT.Deepender Singh Hooda, counting agent for Meira Kumar, maintained that ?broadly, votes for both sides got cancelled? due to errors, but the BJP seemed better prepared. Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.?It?s possible that some members themselves might have got their votes rejected, but there could also be inadvertent errors. The Election Commission should think of a better way to ensure that votes are not rejected,? said Hooda.",general,3346,59,70

Gay relationships still criminalised in 72 countries: Report,"Fifty years after homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, 72 other countries and territories worldwide continue to criminalise same-sex relationships, including 45 in which sexual relationships between women are outlawed.There are eight countries in which homosexuality can result in a death penalty, and dozens more in which homosexual acts can result in a prison sentence, according to an annual report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA).Southern and east Africa, the Middle East and south Asia persist with the most draconian approaches. Western Europe and the western hemisphere are the most tolerant.But Britain was by no means a frontrunner when it moved 50 years ago to partly decriminalise homosexuality. Some 20 other countries had already led the way, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil and Argentina, all of whom had legalised it well before 1900.In Iran, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, homosexuality is still punishable by death, under sharia law. The same applies in parts of Somalia and northern Nigeria. In two other countries ? Syria and Iraq ? the death penalty is carried out by non-state actors, including Islamic State.The report notes that, although the potential exists for a death penalty to be handed down under sharia courts in at least five other countries ? Pakistan, Afghanistan, the UAE, Qatar and Mauritania ? there is no evidence suggesting that it has been implemented for consensual same-sex acts between adults in private.Same-sex relations ? which are variously criminalised under laws covering sodomy, buggery and ?acts against nature? among others ? could lead to a prison sentence in 71 states in all.However, this number excludes Egypt, where same-sex relations are technically legal but are vigorously pursued and where hundreds of people are reported to be detained on morality grounds.Altogether, more than 120 countries have decriminalised homosexuality. But some still cannot be described as liberal. Russia, for example, has recently introduced laws banning the promotion of homosexuality. Russia was recently rebuked by the European court of human rights for a 2013 law banning the spread of ?propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations? among minors.A co-author of the ILGA report, Aengus Carroll, said it remained the case that there was ?no country in the world where LGBT people are safe from discrimination, stigmatisation or violence?.?Legislative change is slow enough in coming, but societal attitudes, particularly those that may evoke taboo, are painstakingly slow,? he said. However, he pointed to some positive developments, in countries including Botswana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Tunisia, where advocates have recently won court cases affirming the right to form organisations to lobby for rights.There have also been ?amazing strides? on sexual orientation and gender identity issues around the world.A parliamentary vote in Germany will lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriage later this year; marriage equality in Malta will bring to 24 the number of states allowing gay marriage. A similar number of states offer civil partnership recognition.At the time of publication of the ILGA report, there were 26 countries that allowed for joint adoption for same-sex couples and 27 in which same-sex second parent adoption ? where a same-sex parent can legally become a step-parent to his or her partner?s child ? was in place.A spokesman for the LGBT charity Stonewall said that, while it was important to remember how far the UK had come on LGBT rights since the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, many challenges remained.?Same-sex relations are illegal in 72 countries, and punishable by death in eight. We all have a part to play in ensuring all LGBT people are accepted without exception and all we can hope is that, in 50 more years, we will have lots more progress to look back on,? said Matt Horwood. ?Trans people still face a number of legal barriers and LGBT people as a whole continue to face discrimination in their daily lives.

Noida housing society allows banned maids to resume work,"Residents of Mahugan Moderne housing complex who had decided not to allow the domestic helps who had stormed the society and taken part in the protest on July 12, have gone back on their decision due to dependence on helps.Many residents have rehired helps who were caught throwing stones and creating a ruckus in the society on July 12.On July 16, residents had decided that around 60 helps caught on camera supporting the mob would be banned. It was decided that only those domestic helps who did not take part in the protest and share a good rapport with their employers would be allowed to resume work.However, the unity among the residents which was appreciated by many seems to have come to an end. Many have now hired those who took part in the events, after giving an undertaking, in writing, that they would take the responsibility of the domestic help in case of any problem.?Yes, few residents have hired helps, whom we banned, after giving an undertaking. It?s their decision and we can?t interfere with that. We are, again, verifying the documents of all the helps working in the society to avoid any issue in the future,? said Alam Negi, an official from JLL, a firm providing services to the apartment.Harshu Sethi, a resident who faced severe criticism after allegations surfaced that she had assaulted Zora Bibi, her domestic help, said that working people are dependent on helps for their daily chores.?These days, both women and men are busy with work and are dependent on helps. I don?t blame them for hiring banned helps because it?s not possible to bring around 2,000 families on the same platform. People who haven?t faced a situation like mine will never understand what I had to go through,? said Sethi.?I was saved by around 200 families from the society. Around 1,000 families are still united in their decision to not hire banned helps,? she said.On July 13, the society had banned all helps from entering the premises to protest against the ?hooliganism? created by supporters of Zora Bibi. All the residents had come together and decided to manage without domestic helps till they come up with a permanent solution to avoid such incidents in the future.Residents faced a riot-like situation on July 12, when a mob stormed into the society premises and vandalised Harshu Sethi?s house. Over 300 people had gathered at the gates of the Mahagun Moderne around 6am, alleging that Harshu had assaulted Zora. The crowd had managed to overpower the security guards and forcefully entered the premises. Harshu?s house was ransacked by the mob.",general,2565,56,70
BJP offered ?15 cr to our Gujarat MLAs: Congress,"The Congress legislators from Gujarat staying at a resort outside Bengaluru are willing to return home if state chief minister Vijay Rupani promises their safety, party spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said on Sunday.The party shepherded 44 lawmakers on Friday night to the holiday retreat in Karnakata after a spate of resignation of its MLAs amid allegations that the ruling BJP in Gujarat were bribing and coercing them ahead of the August 5 vice-presidential election.?We have been threatened, offered money to defect and some have done so,? Gohil, the Congress MLA for Abdasa in the Kutch region, told reporters.The BJP denied the charges and criticised the Congress legislators for leaving the state when it was reeling under floods. Chief minister Rupani visited flood-affected districts in northern Gujarat during the day.Union minister Prakash Javadekar said in New Delhi that the opposition lawmakers were having fun at a resort when their BJP counterparts were busy providing relief to the flood-hit people.?Gujarat Congress leaders are making allegations against the BJP in Bengaluru. It is like a thief attacking a cop. If their leaders are leaving them, it has nothing to do with us,? he said.The Congress responded that its MLAs have not abandoned their constituencies, but were compelled by the BJP to move out.?There is an attempt by the BJP to steal our legislators. But we will fight to save democracy,? Govil said.Dhirubhai Chunilalbhai Bhil, a five-time legislator, alleged that as much as Rs 20 crore was offered to defect. ?But I am proud to say that none of the tribal leaders have fallen for this gimmick.?Rejecting the Congress?s charge, the BJP countered tongue and cheek whether the rival lawmakers were ?purchasable?.The Congress took the MLAs to the southern state, which it rules, after six of its 57 lawmakers in the Gujarat assembly resigned on Friday and Saturday.The defectors are believed to be close to former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela, who quit the Congress on June 21, his 77th birthday, alleging that some party leaders were conspiring against him.The defections reduced the party?s strength in the assembly to 51, but its Rajya Sabha nominee Ahmed Patel still has the numbers to sail through.Patel, the political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, will need the votes of 45 lawmakers. The party hopes two Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) lawmakers will vote for him.

Chiranjeevi's 'Khaidi No 150' hits the theatres,"Ever since its inception, Chiranjeevi troops have been waiting with bated breath to see the megastar making a comeback after a 10-year hiatus. Khaidi No 150 Cast: Chiranjeevi, Kajal Aggarwal, Tarun Arora and Brahmanandam Khaidi No 150 Director: VV VinayakKhaidi No 150 Rating: (3/5)Despite the blockbuster film that Kaththi was, Chiranjeevi has to be appreciated for choosing a remake as his comeback to films. Being at the helm of a remake is like attracting the last nail to one's own coffin as it invariably compels the audience to get into unnecessary comparisons. ALSO READ: Chiranjeevi on Khaidi No 150- I'm not nervous, but curiousALSO READ: Chiranjeevi on Naga Babu-RGV fight- I was hurt, but I didn't reactHowever, director VV Vinayak makes no mistake with Khaidi No 150. Barring a few scenes and songs, the film is a frame-by-frame rendition of the Tamil version.Much like its original, the film introduces Kaththi Seenu (Chiranjeevi), an inmate of a Kolkata prison, trying to escape from the cops. The director shows Seenu's prison number (150), pauses for a few seconds, and then reveals Megastar's face. This customary introduction scene sees a chest-thumping reception from the Telugu circuit; after all, they've been dying to see him for years.As for the plot, a petty thief Kaththi Seenu discovers his badly wounded doppelganger Shankar (also Chiranjeevi) and decides to disguise himself as the latter to escape from the Kolkata police.When the plot slowly unfolds, Seenu gets to know about Shankar, a hydrologist, who is fighting against a corporate tycoon Aggarwal (Tarun Arora). Aggarwal attempts to draw groundwater from the Neeruru village to further his business. He's also to be blamed for the many farmer suicides.After learning the actual reason behind farmer suicides, Seenu and Aggarwal face off in this commercial yet socially relevant entertainer.Apart from the mass moments in the film, what deserves a special mention is Murugadoss's writing. While rampant issues like farmer suicides barely make for front page news, films like Khaidi No 150 or Kaththi pokes the audience's conscience. Films in this genre cater to a larger sect if it manages to deliver entertainment with a veiled social angle in it. In that sense, Khaidi No 150 is a win-win, even if the film is only about half as riveting compared to Chiranjeevi's Rudraveena (1988). There's a superb portion where the director criticises the mainstream media for having failed to address issues like farmer suicide. Some of the scenes have been purposely written to target the masses.Be it dialogue delivery or dancing, Chiranjeevi gives a stellar performance in dual roles. What's amusing about the actor is that even at 61, his age is hardly visible on screen. His son and actor Ram Charan, who has also produced the film, has a guest appearance in the song Ammadu Let's Do Kummudu. It goes without saying that Chiranjeevi's forte is dance and he's flexible with moves even after all these years. Ace comedians Ali and Brahmanandam provide the comic relief in Khaidi No 150.Samantha played the female lead in the Tamil version, while Kajal Aggarwal plays the role in Telugu. Though it's almost necessary to have a heroine on board, we wonder why both the actors were cast in their respective projects.One of the highlights of both the films is the coin fight scene. But the only difference is that while Vijay beat 80 goons to a pulp in Kaththi, the number is multiplied by 10 in its Telugu version. Because, Chiranjeevi. Neil Nitin Mukesh gave a commendable performance as the antagonist in Kaththi. Unfortunately, Tarun Arora is too funny to be taken seriously here.Khaidi No 150 has music by rockstar Devi Sri Prasad. The makers have retained a lot from the Tamil version. Khaidi No 150 would have been far better had Anirudh Ravichander composed the score for the Telugu version as well. Inevitably, most of the background score brings back memories of Kaththi. Though most of the songs spoil the mood of the film, they are worth your time just because you get to watch Chiranjeevi dance.",entertainment,4081,47,70
Cristiano Ronaldo gets airport named in his honour,"Cristiano Ronaldo now has an international airport named after him. The Real Madrid striker was joined on Wednesday by dozens of guests and hundreds of fans in his native Madeira Islands for an official ceremony renaming the local airport as Aeroporto Cristiano Ronaldo.Portugal?s president and the prime minister flew to the island and unveiled a commemorative plaque outside the terminal entrance, above a bust of Ronaldo.The 32-year-old Ronaldo is a local hero in Madeira, where he is seen as a rags-to-riches success. He already has a statue, a museum and a hotel named after him in Madeira. ?You know how proud I am of my roots, my homeland,? Ronaldo, wearing a dark suit and tie, said in a speech.The four-time player of the year has made a record 138 national team appearances for Portugal and is the team?s top scorer with 71 goals.The change was decided by the Madeira regional government after Portugal won the 2016 European Championship. Critics said a more distinguished historical figure would be more appropriate. Petitions were started for and against the change.Ronaldo acknowledged that it was rare for a public figure to be honoured while still alive, saying he was aware that some people didn?t agree with the name change. However, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the tribute was legitimate because it was decided by an elected government.Ronaldo, Rebelo de Sousa said in his speech, is ?an example of excellence? and ?projects Madeira and Portugal across the world far more than anybody else.?Ronaldo is not the first football player with his name on an airport. In Northern Ireland, an airport was renamed George Best Belfast City Airport in 2006, a year after the local player and former Manchester United winger died.In Funchal, the regional government provided transport to the outdoor ceremony for schoolchildren and elderly people at care homes. Also present were players and officials from the local Andorinha soccer club, where Ronaldo started when he was seven years old.Tourism is the economic mainstay of Madeira, which lies about 500km (310 miles) off the north-west coast of Africa. About 2.5 million passengers use the airport annually. The terminal is a low, two-story building next to an oceanside runway where landings are famous for sometimes being hairy because of crosswinds.",sports,2322,50,70

ICC mulls scrapping Champions Trophy for an extra World T20,"International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive David Richardson has revealed that Champions Trophy could be scrapped to make way for the World T20 every two years.India slumped to a crushing 180-run defeat at the hands of their arch-rivals Pakistan at the Kennington Oval on Sunday, with an estimated viewing audience in hundreds of millions.However, some officials argued that the recently-concluded eight-team marquee event is too similar to the World Cup, which the ICC has decided will be contested with just 10 teams from 2019 in England.And Richardson admitted that there should be some differentiation in global events and, therefore, the 2021 Champions Trophy, scheduled to be held in India, is not guaranteed to go ahead, the Dawn reported.""What we want to do is differentiate our global events from each other so that they can be standalone and create maximum interest every time the event happens,"" Richardson told reporters via telephonic conversation on the eve of the ICC's annual conference in London.""At this stage, the next Champions Trophy is still scheduled for India in 2021. Whether that gets changed, the consideration has been given to changing to two T20s in a four-year cycle which would mean swapping the Champions Trophy for a World T20,"" he added.Richardson believes that World T20s attract a lot more attention than ODI tournaments and also generate significant revenue for the television companies.He further insisted that the idea is to give opportunities to more teams, hinting at the possibility of 20 teams featuring in World T20s in future.",sports,1582,59,70

60-yr-old lynched over rumours she was cutting people's hair,"A 60-year old Dalit woman was allegedly lynched in Agra after villagers thought she was out to cut the hair of sleeping women, the first reported fatality of what appears to be turning into a case of mass hysteria.Growing number of people, particularly in rural districts, of Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have reported mysterious instances of sleeping women being attacked and their hair chopped off short. Family members said Maan Devi left the home around 4am on Wednesday but lost her way, reaching a predominantly upper caste neighbourhood where people spotted her. ?She pleaded that she had lost her way but they took as one responsible for chopping women hair in Mutnai village and killed her,? said the victim?s daughter-in-law Kalpana Jatav.Local police first denied the death was connected to the ?ghost barber? panic. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Fatehabad, Dr Tej Veer Singh said a case was registered including charges relating to atrocities against Dalits, and teams were keeping a vigil in the area where the woman was killed. The police also appeared to deny that the woman was beaten to death. ?The post-mortem report of Maan Devi indicates she died of cardiac arrest and not due to beating,? Singh said. Devi?s son has named two suspects, both from the upper caste Baghel community, in his complaint where he also said that his mother?s body had been thrown back in their village. Till Thursday, neither was arrested.Agra and villages in districts nearby were the latest to report the hair-cutting mystery that seems to be spreading since first being recorded in parts of the National Capital Region last week. Officials said on Friday that more ?sightings? were reported from the region, and the state?s Inspector General issued an appeal for people to remain calm.Women in at least five states have reported waking up to the sound of scissors, spotting black cats, and seeing ghosts and shadows. Some claimed they found portions of their hair chopped off, and others reported falling unconscious with fear.Police have dismissed the allegations as rumours in several of these cases, and administration officials are now issuing alerts for local law enforcement to tackle fear mongering. FROM MONKEY MAN TO UFOsParts of India, particularly rural districts where superstitious beliefs are common, have often been at the centre of mass hysteria events. In the summer of 2001, people in Delhi said they had spotted a mysterious monkey-like creature that appeared in the night and attacked people. Large colonies of the capital were gripped by fear as more and more bizarre ?sightings? were recorded. Vigilante groups patrolled the streets with sticks for weeks, before officials and psychiatric experts said the panic was created by ?figments of people?s imagination? that was made worse by the media coverage at the time.A year later, people in Eastern Uttar Pradesh reported spotting a light-emitting flying object that would attack them at night and scratch their face. Many referred to it as the ?muhnochwa?, a Bhojpuri amalgam that loosely translates to ?face snatcher?. At the height of the panic, people went off streets after sundown. Scientists from IIT Kanpur were roped in to investigate the event, and the ruled out the existence of the creature. The closest explanation, they said, could have been sightings of ball lightening, a rare meteorological phenomenon. Years earlier, in 1995, a more innocuous mass delusion took place when people across the country reported seeing idols of the Hindu god Ganesha drinking milk.",general,3592,60,70

World's oldest manatee dies a day after 69th birthday,"Snooty, the world?s oldest known manatee, died on Sunday at his Florida home, a day after celebrating his 69th birthday.In a statement, South Florida Museum chief executive Brynne Anne Besio said Snooty?s death appeared to be ?a heartbreaking accident? and added that staff were ?devastated?.In a press conference from Bradenton broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, museum provost and chief operating officer Jeff Rodgers said Snooty died after becoming stuck in a maintenance hatch leading off the tank he shared with three young rescued manatees, Randall, Baca and Gale.?The hatch is big enough for a 1,300lb manatee to get in,? Rodgers said. ?It appears that he was not able to get himself back around to get himself out of the situation.?Asked if Snooty had drowned, Rodgers said the manatee had been taken for a necropsy, the results of which were not yet known. The three young manatees were not injured, he said.The necropsy will be carried out by Snooty?s veterinarian of more than 20 years and the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission.Besio said: ?We?re all devastated about his passing. We?re reviewing what happened and will be conducting a full investigation. Snooty was such a unique animal and he had so much personality that people couldn?t help but be drawn to him. As you can imagine, I ? and our staff, volunteers and board members ? considered him a star. We all deeply mourn his passing.?Manatees, sometimes known as sea cows, are large aquatic air-breathing herbivores closely related to elephants. Under constant threat from mankind, whether in American waters, the Amazon or west Africa, manatee are classified as an endangered species by state, federal and world bodies. Numbers of wild manatees in Florida have recently increased as a result of protection programmes.Manatees generally live into their teens in the wild, with some reaching their forties or older, museum spokeswoman Jessica Schubick said. Snooty was on record as the oldest manatee in captivity, having spent 68 of his 69 years at the South Florida Museum. He was believed to be the oldest manatee in the world.Rodgers ruled out malicious or foul play in the manatee?s death, although he said the opening of the hatch remained a mystery as it was designed not to let manatees in the tank push through it. A ?Snootycam? trained on the tank was turned off at night, he said, and other security cameras could not see underwater. Snooty was discovered on Sunday morning.?We?ve been greeting people at the front door to share the heartbreaking news,? Rodgers said of a day through which the aquarium remained closed. He added that staff had helped adult visitors break the news to their children ?as they saw fit?.?Aquarium staff is heartbroken,? he said. ?We are working with them as well, with the emotional situation, they?re actively caring for the three rehab manatees today so life goes on for those manatees ?

Air India to fine unruly flyers up to ?15L for flight delay,"Passengers delaying flights beyond two hours in an air rage could be fined Rs 15 lakh, says national carrier Air India?s proposed set of standard operating procedures to tackle unruly flyers.The draft SOPs detail steps for the crew and ground staff in the event of ugly incidents such as two recent controversies involving parliamentarians Ravindra Gaikwad of the Shiv Sena and Trinamool Congress?s Dola Sen.Gaikwad was banned from flying by six airlines after he assaulted a senior Air India official with his slippers, allegedly angry over the state-run carrier shifting him from business class to economy on a Pune-New Delhi flight this March. But his name was struck off the ?no-fly? list 10 days ago after political intervention.Air India says the Gaikwad incident caused a flight delay of 90 minutes. Similarly, Trinamool?s Sen had an argument with the cabin crew and delayed the flight for 39 minutes.. @airindian prepares SOP to handle 'unruly passengers'. To levy fine upto R 15 lakh, in case they delay the flight. @htTweets @htdelhi? Faizan Haidar (@FaiHaider) April 17, 2017The proposal lists six steps to tackle similar situations, including informing the airport manager, no direct interaction with media, immediate filing of police complaint, assessment of damage, and fining a misbehaving flier in accordance with the amount of delay.If a rowdy passenger causes a delay of up to an hour, he will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5 lakh. For delays between one and two hours, the fine is Rs 10 lakh; and Rs 15 lakh for beyond two hours.An internal communication of the airline says such incidents should be prevented as these affect the crew?s morale.?The proposal from the commercial department has been forwarded to the legal team. After the legal opinion, we will notify it. In between, we hope the definition of unruly passengers will be out. Otherwise, we will define it,? an Air India official said on Monday.The fine could be symbolic, though.?Even a roadside hotel has a board saying ?right to admission reserved?. Air India, thus, must have a procedure for handling unruly passengers. Further, recent incidents have revealed that unruly behaviour does not require any provocation,? the proposal says.Hundreds of flyers ? mostly drunk, petulant or arrogant ? have been grounded, blacklisted, arrested, fined and imprisoned for their aggressive behaviour since aviation became an accessible and favoured mode of transport around the world.Last December, a Citibank vice-president and his girlfriend were arrested in America for fighting with the flight crew and fellow passengers.Back home, a police complaint was lodged against Gaikwad, the Sena MP for Osmanabad, who had bragged before television camera that he hit the Air India employee with his slippers 25 times.Air India retaliated by blocking seven attempts he made to book a ticket, changing the spelling of his surname and using prefixes such as Prof. He was forced to travel by train.All six airlines cited passenger safety as a reason for banning him from flying.Gaikwad didn?t face any police action. Instead, Air India lifted the travel ban as the central government intervened. He expressed regret for the incident, but did not apologise.The Shiv Sena, an ally of the ruling BJP at the Centre and Maharashtra, held him clean and threatened to stop all flights from Mumbai and skip a meeting of the NDA if the ban was not revoked. Also, Sena parliamentarians created a ruckus in Parliament.",general,3471,59,70

Rare venomous snake rescued from a park in Delhi,"A poisonous viper was rescued from a park at a residential colony in Rohini by an NGO on Saturday.The rare snake was first spotted by some children playing in the neighbourhood park, after which a resident immediately called Wildlife SOS for help.?A rapid response team, comprising two trained snake rescuers, arrived at the location and identified the snake as a Russell?s viper (Daboia russelii), one of the ?big four? venomous snakes to be found in the Indian subcontinent. They are protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,? a Wildlife SOS official said.Geeta Seshamani, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, told that the exquisite viper is not commonly found in the Delhi-NCR region. It was a dangerous operation as the Russell?s viper is highly venomous.?The team had to take precautionary measures to ensure the safety of bystanders as well as of the snake. Though slow moving, they are capable of fast strikes when provoked and will give out a warning hiss before striking,? Seshamani said.The NGO has kept the snake under observation. It will be released later in the wild.Chief wildlife warden of Delhi AK Shukla, said, ?In sensitive rescue operations such as this, public safety as well as the safety of the animal is of utmost concern and we are happy to see that the viper was safely rescued.?The Russell?s viper is shy and elusive by nature, and hence rarely sighted. Found in open grassy areas, scrub jungles and rocky hillocks, they feed mainly on rodents and small mammals, lizards, birds and frogs. They are a nocturnal species preferring to hunt at night but during winters they tend to be more active during the day. It is possible that increased urbanisation has left these reclusive reptiles with little space to hide which resulted in their being found in human settlements.",general,1812,48,70

AAP campaigns to get anti-corruption activist back in party,"A group of workers from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have recently started a campaign to get anti-corruption activist Anjali Damania back in the party.Damania has been responsible for exposing irrigation scam as well as Maharashtra Sadan scam that saw Nationalist Congress Party leader Chhagan Bhujbal being put in jail. A well-known face in Maharashtra, Damania quit the AAP in 2015 following allegations levelled against the party leadership. On Saturday, 150 AAP volunteers reached her home in Santacruz requesting her to return to the party. ?We want all good people to come back to the party and continue their fight against the corrupt,? said Abhishek Bhat, an AAP volunteer. The volunteers have asked Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to convince Damania to return. They have also started a twitter campaign to get her back. Damania, who was a part of veteran activist Anna Hazare?s agitation India Against Corruption (IAC), was also the founding member of AAP in 2012. She led the Maharashtra unit exposing various scams during the tenure of Congress-NCP government in the state. She also fought the 2014 Lok Sabha election unsuccessfully against Union minister Nitin Gadkari from Nagpur. AAP lost all the 48 seats it contested in Maharashtra. AAP then did not contest the Assembly polls and in September 2014 Damania resigned from the post of party?s convenor in Maharashtra. In February 2015, following allegations of alleged horse trading against Kejriwal, Damania quit the outfit. She tweeted ?I quit. I have not come to AAP for this nonsense. I believed him. I backed Arvind for principles not Horse-trading.?She became active again in the political circles when she started a campaign against the then revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who was forced to resign. Damania said she has not taken any decision on rejoining AAP. ?They gheroed me and asked me to return to the party. It is too early to react now,? said Damania. The AAP has lost much of its steam. Top leaders like Medha Patkar have quit th eparty. Apart from the occasional exposes against political leaders, the Maharashtra unit seems to be going nowhere.",general,2126,59,70

RBI asks banks to resolve 55 bad loan accounts in 6 months,"By Kumar Dipankar New Delhi, Jun 22 (PTI) RBI has asked banks to resolve 55 high value cases of bad loans within 6 months or face the prospect of being directed to go in for the new insolvency resolution mechanism as part of the strategy to rein in unacceptable level of non-performing assets (NPAs). Earlier this month, Reserve Bank of India identified 12 accounts for insolvency proceedings with each of them having over Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans, accounting for 25 per cent of total NPAs of banks. RBI has asked banks to find solution for 55 identified NPA accounts within 6 months otherwise the central bank would examine those cases and refer for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), official sources said. RBI is of the view that banks should expedite the NPA resolution process for these cases as soon as possible, the sources said. In cases where a viable resolution plan is not agreed upon within six months, banks would be asked to file insolvency proceedings against the defaulters under the IBC, sources added. The banking sector is saddled with NPAs of over Rs 8 lakh crore, of which Rs 6 lakh crore is with public sector banks (PSBs). The 12 identified cases account for 25 per cent or about Rs 2 lakh crore of NPAs. IBC has defined time-frame for the resolution and there is 14-day time period for admission or rejection of a case by National Company Law Tribunal. After a case is accepted by NCLT, the creditor would get 30 days to hire insolvency practitioners and then the entire process to be completed in 180 days which will look at various possibilities including revival of projects or liquidation. RBI had set up an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) for such cases that may be considered for reference for resolution under the IBC, under which the 12 accounts were identified with fund and non-fund based outstanding amount greater than Rs 5,000 crore as of March 31, 2016. These measures were announced by RBI following an ordinance giving it wide-ranging legislative powers to fight NPAs. The ordinance authorised RBI to issue directions to banks to initiate insolvency resolution process in the event of a default under the provisions of IBC.",general,2201,58,70
Saudi Arabia blacklists Qatari charity groups over terrorism,"Saudi Arabia and its allies on Tuesday announced they had blacklisted charity groups and individuals with ties to Yemen, Qatar and Libya, labelling them ?terrorist? over suspected ties to Islamist extremism. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt released a joint statement naming nine charity organisations and nine individuals ?directly or indirectly linked to Qatari authorities? as ?terrorist?, according to a statement carried by the SPA state news agency. The four Arab states last month suspended ties with Qatar over allegations the Gulf state bankrolled Islamist extremism, an accusation Doha has consistently denied. The four states recalled their ambassadors from Doha, banned Qatar from using their airspace and ordered all Qataris to repatriate. Among the demands of Riyadh and its allies are the closure of Qatari broadcast giant Al-Jazeera, which has been banned in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Three organisations in Yemen and six based in Libya were accused of ties to Al-Qaeda and a Syrian affiliate of the group in Tuesday?s statement.

2 new subjects added to competency tests in Maha schools,"From this academic year, two more subjects ? science and English (third language), for non-English speakers ? will be added to the competency tests introduced two years ago to assess pupils from classes 1 to 8 in basic skills.

Schools were found to be sharing the papers with students before the exams and in some areas they were being openly sold in the market.The government has decided to test students in science and English (third language) as surveys show that students are weak in these subjects. An Annual Status of Education Report (2016) showed that only 62.5% students in class 5 can read. This is much lower than the national average of 47.8%. Similarly, the number of students who can divide was 20.3%, while it was 25. 9% nationally.?It is necessary to develop students competencies in science and English along with math and other languages,? said said Nand Kumar, principal secretary of the department. ?English proficiency is needed in today?s world. Science skills are equally essential,? he added.Results of the state achievement surveys and competency tests revealed slight improvement in first language and math competencies, language skills improved by 6.08% and numerical skills by 4.02% in the past two years in the tests held in 2016-17 and 2015-2016.To ensure that schools conduct the tests in a fair manner, the GR has asked that centre heads should be appointed in schools to supervise the exams. A month after the exams, they will randomly test students in the same subjects to see if the scores are accurate. If a difference of more than 20% is recorded, then the teachers will be trained in evaluating students.Schools, however, are worried this will increase the number of exams in an academic year. ?Students will be burdened by the additional exams, it will increase their stress,? said Uday Nare, senior teacher, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri. The department needs to find ways of assessment without adding exams to the calendar, he said. New subjects from this yearClass 1 and 2---First language and mathClasses 3 to 5?First language, math, and, English (third language)Classes 6 to 8---First language, math, English (third language), and, science How schools will be judgedStudents scoring above 75% in all the skills will be considered as progressive studentsSchools in which all students score above 75% in all skills and bag more than 60% in the tests will be considered as progressive schools.If all students in a school score:Above 80% then teachers will receive appreciation lettersAbove 60%, they will get motivational lettersBelow 40%, cognizance will be taken",general,3124,56,70

Water taxi services on Yamuna to begin by June,"Delhi may join the elite club of cities with water taxi services by June end as the Centre?s Yamuna Water Taxi project to ferry tourists and public from Palla (Delhi-Haryana border) to Wazirabad is moving as per schedule.The service aims to promote tourism and reduce travel time between Wazirabad and Fatehpur Jat to 45 minutes. The distance between two points is nearly 20 kilomertres but due to poor public transport connectivity and heavy traffic movement on the stretch (it connects the national capital to Haryana) , it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance. Initially, only three of the five boarding points will open. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been appointed to implement the project and the process to procure vessels and develop infrastructure is already underway. The authority has moved a plea seeking environmental clearance from the National Green Tribunal (NGT).Amitabh Verma, chairman of IWAI, said as no permanent structure will be constructed, the authority hopes it will get a nod from the environment watchdog. ?Things are very much on the track. Tenders for dredging, three passenger vessels, and jetties have been floated. Hopefully, by the end of June, we will start the ferry service in the city,? he said.The decision came after a feasibility study was done to identify a suitable stretch of the river for navigation and development of water transport facilities. After this, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra along with the officials of IWAI, irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board (DJB), conducted a site inspection in July 2016. Experts disapproveEnvironmentalists are not amused with the idea and said the river does not have enough water round the year to survive such activities on a large scale. Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said the water available on the stretch is meant to be used for drinking purposes and this arrangement should not be disturbed. ?This will affect the biodiversity along the river. If one wants to use small-hand rowing boats for leisure, it makes sense but water taxis will be useless,? he said.Environmentalist Vikram Soni, a professor at Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, said the plan does not seem feasible because the river does not have enough water except for the three months during monsoon. ?This will lead to destruction of the flood plain. They should not touch it but make efforts to save it for future generations,? he said.Authorities optimisticAfter the feasibility study, it was found that the stretch is suitable for the implementation of one of the priority projects of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. ?Yamuna upstream, which is almost 22 kms from Wazirabad to Palla, is less polluted and has the ?required depth? for navigation. The study said that water taxi and recreation activities are the most feasible and environmentally sustainable for this stretch. The initiative will help keep burden off the roads to some extent,? added Verma.If the plan is implemented successfully, the authorities are optimistic that it will pave the way for introduction of more water recreational activities or sports in Delhi and the Centre?s ambitious Delhi-Agra steamer service through Agra Canal project. ?Water sports are quite common and popular abroad. This will not only help boost tourism but also facilitate to rejuvenate the river by sensitising the youth about the importance of the river,? he said.",general,3479,46,70

Kerala bar builds maze to beat liquor sale ban near highways,"A bar in Kerala has come up with an exceptional way to get around the new rule banning alcohol near highways.Aishwarya Restobar in Paravoor, Ernakulam, now has a full-blown maze around the building, much like in Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (the Triwizard Tournament, duh?).Reason?After the Supreme Court ruled a ban on the sale of liquor within 500 metres of national/state highways, things became difficult for Aishwarya Restobar as it was situated near NH 17. The only way to get around this was to take the bar further away from the national highway.Hence, as The News Minute reports, the owner of Aishwarya Restobar built the 250- 300 metre long maze to increase the distance between his bar and the nearest highway.So, technically, the bar is not longer 'situated within 500 metres from the highwayâ??. According to TNM, the construction of this maze cost around Rs 2 lakh.However, it is yet to know whether this trick will actually give the bar a free pass from the new liquor ban near highways.Kerala bar's ingenious idea to beat SC order: A twisted maze to the entrance https://t.co/m8Vi3uQVaZpic.twitter.com/oH0XbCcGruAlso read:Liquor ban: Left high and dry, states find ways to bypass order, protect revenue",general,1227,60,70

Beijing residents warned against touching 'dirty' snow,"From K J M Varma Beijing, Jan 7 (PTI) Chinese Met depatment today warned people in capital Beijing to avoid coming in contact with snow which officials said is ""dirty"" as it has absorbed pollutants which had enveloped the city since the final day of the last year. The Beijing weather forecast bureau said that snow followed by blasts of cold wind will clean up the air this weekend. Snow fell in many parts of Beijing today morning and is expected to last into the night, bringing a bit of relief from the smog that has persisted since the last day of 2016. The city witnessed slight snow but the smog continued to envelope the city. Meteorologist Guo Jianxing, however, warned the public not to get too close to snow. ""Because the snow absorbs pollutants, it is dirty,"" Guo said. ""People should carry umbrellas if they walk outside and quickly brush off any snow that falls on their skin,"" he was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency. According to the citys air quality surveillance centre, with the exception of northwestern Beijing, the capital remained ""seriously polluted"" as of 1 pm today. The density of PM 2.5 - tiny pollutant - was 178 micrograms per cubic meter. The weather bureau said gusts of wind, a major force to dispel the smog, will start to arrive tomorrow from the north. It said Beijings heavy air pollution will be eased and finally cleared from north to south. At worst, only very light smog will linger in a small portion of the city, it added. The smog has become north Chinas biggest environmental issue in recent years, particularly in winter, when coal-fired heating boilers rev up and the wind weakens. Despite drops in pollution indicators, smog still frequently occurs, the report said. Chen Jining, minister of environmental protection, told media here yesterday that his ministry is evaluating emergency plans of 20 cities including Beijing in dealing with heavy air pollution amid criticism that officials shun putting out high alerts to avoid taking action against erring factories. Chen said that inspections had found some cities failing to take effective measures following alerts, or their measures were impracticable. Though pollution in Beijing exceeded hazardous levels for the past several days, the city has not issued the red alert, the maximum warning which would warrant enforcement of odd and even number car system, closure of schools and factories emitting pollution as construction sites.",general,2453,54,70

The music director said his mother made a choice and motivated him to make a career in music. ""I never knew that I was born for music. My mom made the choice and she kind of predicted that I will be a music composer. The day I realized that music would be my passion and future was when I went to my studio that had no equipment. ""It was just a shell; just a sound proof room with an AC that smelled new. I felt one day I will have all types of equipment all over this place that I cant afford now."" Rahman, who participated in a panel discussion here on ""Creativity in Innovation,"" alongside fellow Oscar winner Resul Pookutty, said his only aim was to practice and learn music. ""Around 1986, I stopped playing for other composers. I felt practicing or learning about music was my investment. I didnt care about opportunities. ""If you are good enough, people will come to you. You have to raise your standards and prove that you are passionate. Then you dont have to go behind people. I felt its a jinx to go behind people.""",general,1203,60,70

Nothing unconstitutional in cow slaughter ban: Kerala HC,"A day after the Madras High Court ordered a month-long stay on the Centre's ban on cattle sale for slaughter, the Kerala High Court today said there is no need for it to interfere with the new rules as it doesn't violate the Constitution.Kerala High Court Chief Justice Navniti Prasad said this while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought quashing of notification on ban on cattle sale for slaughter.The court said there is no constitutional violation in the order issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change which has created an uproar in some states including Kerala.The Kerala High Court observed that there was nothing in the new central law on cattle trade and slaughter that takes away the rights of people with regard to eating beef.""If anyone reads it properly, the present law prevailing in the country along with the new order that came out none will not have come to this sort of conclusion. There is no ban on slaughter or sale of beef. What has been said in the new order is that mass sale of cattle for slaughter through the cattle market is banned,"" observed the Chief Justice.DIFFERENCE WITH MADRAS HIGH COURTWhen Advocate General CP Sudhakara Prasad pointed out the ruling of the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court had stayed the new order, the Chief Justice expressed surprise.Youth Congress activist Sunil, who filed the PIL, withdrew it after the hearing.The Madurai bench of Madras High Court had yesterday ordered a month's stay on the central government's notification on animal slaughter.Hearing a PIL, the court directed the state and central government to reply in four weeks.THE CONTROVERSYVarious bodies and political parties have reacted sharply to the government's decision, saying it is an ""ill-advised"" move which will widen the ""terrorism"" by cow vigilantes. It has also been criticised that the order imposes an indirect ban on beef.The notification had created an uproar in many states including protests by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.In Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, a group of students conducted a beef festival, showing their agitation against the Centre's order.Against this backdrop, union minister Venkaiah Naidu has said the Centre is examining the issues. It was also reported earlier that the government may exempt buffalo from the list.THE NEW RULESThe Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had last week notified new rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, which bans sale of cattle for slaughter in open markets across the country.A gazette notification, titled Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 by the ministry had stated that no one can bring cattle to an animal market unless he or she has furnished a written declaration that the cattle will not be sold for the purpose of slaughter.Further, upon sale of cattle, the animal market committee will take an ""undertaking"" that the animals are for agricultural purposes and not for slaughter.Also read:",general,3104,56,70
Police save woman attempting to live-stream her suicide,"In what could have been a repeat of last month's Arjun Bhardwaj suicide, a 32-year-old woman lawyer attempted killing herself in Mumbai while live-streaming her life's final moments on social media. Priyanka Jethalal Maru planned to jump off the 18th floor of an under-construction building. However, officials from the Mumbai Police who reached the location dissuaded her from taking her life. Maru was spotted on the 18th floor of an under-construction building in Mumbai's Sewri area by a resident of a nearby apartment. The resident informed the Mumbai Police control room, which sent a team to the location. Maru, who planned on jumping off the building, was seen shooting a selfie video. However, the police team, led by Inspector Shalini Sharma, persuaded her not to take the extreme step. Sharma, who is trained in handling such situations, was instrumental in dissuading Maru, news agency PTI reported.

Vatican turns off fountains for 1st time in yrs amid drought,"Vatican authorities have turned off 100 fountains, including two Baroque masterpieces in St. Peter?s Square, due to a prolonged drought affecting the tiny city state and the city of Rome, which surrounds it. Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the world?s 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. Standing in St Peter?s Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. ?This is the Vatican?s way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis,? he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days. Rome is gasping after 72% less rain than normal fell in July, according to Sky Italia?s weather TV channel. There was 74% less than normal in June, and a 56% reduction from the long-term average across March, April and May. Caring for the planet and its resources is an important issue for Pope Francis, who demanded swift action by world leaders in the first ever papal document dedicated to the environment. ?This decision is very much in line with the pope?s thinking on ecology: you can?t waste and sometimes you have to be willing to make a sacrifice,?

Jews world's best-educated religious group: Study,"Jews are better educated than any other major religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and a majority going on to higher education, a study has found.At the other end of the educational scale, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years.The main reason for the disparity is that Jews are largely concentrated in Israel and the US, countries with high levels of education generally, whereas 98% of the world?s Hindus live in the developing countries of India, Nepal and Bangladesh.Among Muslims, those that live in countries with strong economies are well-educated, but those who live in developing regions have comparatively short periods of formal schooling ? and girls fare worse than boys.But there are also notable differences between religious groups in the same areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where Christians are generally better educated than Muslims.The study, Religion and Education Around the World, was published on Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center.It found that, compared with the Jewish average of more than 13 years of formal schooling, Christians had 9.3 years, Buddhists 7.9, and Muslims and Hindus 5.6. Adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average.Almost one in five of all adults ? more than 680 million people ? received no formal schooling, but for Muslims and Hindus, the number missing out on education rose to around two in five.However, in recent years the amount of time spent at school has increased among all groups.According to Pew, the youngest Hindus in the study (born between 1976 and 1985) spent an average of 7.1 years in school ? nearly twice as long as the oldest Hindus (born between 1936 and 1955).Within three generations, Muslims, similarly, were spending an extra three years at school, with an extra 2.5 years for Buddhists. Over the same period, Christians gained just an extra year and Jews less than half a year.Among religiously unaffiliated adults, the youngest had an extra 2.9 years in school, overtaking Christians for the number of school years for this age group.Pew found similar changes when looking at the educational gender gap. Although overall a much higher proportion of women had received no formal education, and those that had generally spent fewer years in school, the gap was shrinking with successive generations.But among Hindus, there was still an 18-point gap between the youngest men and women, with 38% of women having no formal education compared with 20% of men.The gender gap among the youngest Muslims was 10 points, with 33% of women not going to school compared with 23% of men.The religiously unaffiliated had closed the gap within three generations, although there were still 2% of men and women having no formal education.In higher education, Jews strikingly reversed the gender gap. In the youngest group, 69% of women have degrees compared with 57% of men ? reversing a seven-point gap in favour of men among the oldest Jews to a 12-point gap in favour of women. Christians and the religiously unaffiliated also reversed gaps but to a lesser extent.The report emphasises the difference in education between people in economically developed areas and those in poorer, less developed ones, regardless of religion. Among the factors affecting education levels are socioeconomic conditions, armed conflict, child labour and child marriage.Christians in Europe and North America tend to be much more highly educated than those in sub-Saharan Africa.Hindus have relatively low levels of education in India, Bangladesh and Nepal ? but in the US, 96% have college degrees, a higher share than any other major religious group.In general, religious minorities in the US are more likely to have college degrees than the Christian majority (Hindus 96%, Jews 75%, Muslims 54%, Buddhists 53%, unaffiliated 44%, Christians 36%).In sub-Saharan Africa, Muslims are more than twice as likely as Christians to have no formal schooling ? and the gap is widening.The report says: ?Some scholars suggest that the source of the Christian-Muslim attainment gap is rooted in the location of Christian missionary activity during colonial times. Missionary-built educational facilities were often located in what became heavily Christian areas rather than predominantly Muslim locales ? As a result, Christians gained an educational edge over Muslims that lasted decades.?",science,4471,49,70

Accidental damage to Yamuna already restored by nature: AOL,"A scientific report prepared by Art of Living claimed that any ?accidental damage? to the ecology of the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Living?s cultural event in 2016 has already been restored by nature.This contradicts the earlier findings by the National Green Tribunal-appointed seven-member expert committee, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and Rs42 crore to fix the physical and biological damages caused to the river?s floodplains by the event.?If at all any such accidental damage would have taken place during the event, in all probability they have already been reversed by natural processes. With the arrival of monsoon in 2016, all the lost plants and animals would have re-colonised the event site,? the foundation?s report has claimed. Instead the NGO report has hinted that removal of shrubs, tall grasses, aquatic vegetation and reeds from the event site, which the NGT panel had dubbed as harmful to the floodplains, is actually beneficial to the ecology as it also helped remove invasive exotic species such as water hyacinth.Experts from both the NGT?s panel and the foundation?s team refused to comment on this ongoing war between scientists and experts of the two panels. Art of Living had filed a 200-page parallel report in the NGT to counter the allegations levelled against it. The foundation, founded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has been in the centre of controversy, had roped in at least 15 experts to prepare a scientific report. Experts in the Art of Living?s panel also alleged that satellite images, which forms one of the main pillars of the report submitted by the NGT-appointed panel, has been misinterpreted. The NGT panel had used satellite images and ground reports while claiming that large tracts of wetlands and water bodies were filled up for the event. ?One of the most glaring mistakes made in the report is the declaration of dry farmlands as huge tract of wetlands filled with water and several water bodies etc. Even the agricultural crops have been considered as wetland vegetation with shallow to deep water beneath them,? the NGO?s report has claimed. The experts pointed out that even the Survey of India?s report and National Wetland Atlas prepared by Space Application Centre have no mention of any such wetlands. The atlas had listed around 399 wetlands, including 301 micro wetlands in Delhi alone. The foundation?s report has also challenged the NGT-panel?s allegations that nearly 420 acres of Yamuna floodplains were damaged. Experts questioned how can an event, held over 25 acres of land, damage 420 acres of floodplains.The NGT panel had accused the foundation of levelling and compacting the soil resulting in heavy damage to the floodplains as it stopped the soil?s gaseous exchange and played havoc with the ground water recharging system. Experts who prepared the foundation?s report, however, claimed that compaction if any was done much earlier when construction of guide banks, DND and Barapullah drain were going on. ?It is impossible for even a practicing geophysicist to claim that ground was levelled or compacted without a geophysical study,? says the reports.",general,3182,59,70

Mayawati's resignation from RS may not be accepted: Reports,"Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati resigned from Parliament on Tuesday, hours after storming out of the Rajya Sabha over not being allowed time to complete her speech on alleged Dalit atrocities in Uttar Pradesh.The resignation of Mayawati, a Dalit leader and a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, may not be accepted since it does not follow a prescribed format, but her move could give her a political point by projecting herself as a champion of the Dalit cause. ?Jab satta paksh mujhe apni baat rakhne ka bhi samay nahi de raha hai toh mera isteefa dena hi theek hai (If the ruling party is not going to allow me to speak, then it?s better to resign),?

Read | What BSP chief Mayawati?s threat to quit Rajya Sabha meansThe Rajya Sabha session began at 11am, and shortly afterwards Mayawati began speaking on atrocities against Dalits after being given 3 minutes to raise the issue. As she went past the scheduled time, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien stopped her and an angry Mayawati stormed out of the House threatening to resign. In her 3-page resignation letter, she detailed the morning?s incident as the reason for her decision, which technically is a breach of protocol. A parliamentarian cannot cite a motive or reason for quitting, parliamentary procedure dictates. If people in power, the Bharatiya Janata Party or the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) does not allow me to speak in the interest of marginalised communities, then I can no longer continue in this Parliament, she said in the letter written in Hindi.Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukthar Abbas Naqvi said Mayawati had insulted the chair by threatening to resign. ?She must apologise.?He said the government was prepared to raise all issues. Opposition leader Ghulam Nabi Azad supported Mayawati and took objection to Naqvi?s remarks. ?When Mayawati tried to talk, she was told we have got the mandate. We did not know the BJP has got the mandate to massacre minorities and Dalits,? Azad, a Congress leader, said amid interruptions by the treasury benches. If her resignation is accepted, the BSP as well as the Opposition will lose an MP while the BJP in UP will bag the seat. Rajya Sabha members are elected by MLAs of the state and in UP, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP has a brute majority.The BSP chief?s term is going to end in April 2018. Given that her party has just 19 MLAs in the 403 member-strong assembly, the Dalit leader is unlikely to get any seat in the biennial polls in April. Her party has no member in the Lok Sabha, and observers say her focus on Dalit atrocities is part of a strategy for her to claw back political mileage.",general,2808,59,70
Congress got lesser seats than Apna Dal (Soneylal) in UP,"In a more shocking revelation for beleaguered Congress, the Uttar Pradesh verdict has thrown up yet another disturbing fact: that it is now an even smaller player than BJP ally Apna Dal.ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS 2017: FULL COVERAGEApna Dal (Soneylal) headed by Anupriya Patel, who is a minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi cabinet, contested on 11 seats and won nine of them. On the other hand, the Congress, which contested the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election as junior ally to the ruling Samajwadi Party, fielded candidates on 105 seats. The party won a meagre seven seats. What was more humiliating for the Congress is that it lost all the four Assembly seats in Amethi, a region considered to be the grand old party's pocket borough. Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi represents Amethi in Lok Sabha and despite the party using its 'star campaigner' Priyanka Gandhi to campaign for it in the region, voters rejected it.THE INSULTWhen Congress decided to contest Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh in association with the Samajwadi Party, the Opposition mocked it for playing a junior partner to the ruling party.

The controversy over Sidhu's appearance as a celebrity-judge on the hugely popular television show - The Kapil Sharma Show - erupted after Punjab CM Amarinder Singh told India Today that he would seek legal opinion over Sidhu continuing his TV work even after becoming a minister.On Tuesday, Sidhu said he respects Amarinder and will follow his orders but added that there was no conflict of interest in him appearing on TV.""Whatever Captain Amarinder Singh said, the boss is always right. But I want to tell you that the term office of profit only implies to a post held under government office. BJP MP and actor Kirron Kher works for television. I have quit IPL and nearly 70 to 80 per cent television assignments. I perform the government duties between 9 am to 6 pm. If I go anywhere after 6 pm and return by 9 am whatever I do at night should not be the business of anybody. Nobody should evince interest in it,"" Navjot Singh Sidhu had said. Sidhu, who was believed to be a front runner for the post of deputy chief minister, was given a rather lightweight department to look after. He was made minister of tourism and culture, and local bodies in the new Congress government in Punjab.WATCH: Navjot Singh Sidhu: TV job isn't office of profitALSO READ:",general,1738,58,70

Air hostess reveals she rescued human trafficking victim,"Though many might dismiss the role of a flight attendant or an air hostess, this story will throw much-needed light on some of the heavy responsibilities these women carry on their shoulders every day.A flight attendant named Sheila Frederick rescued a victim of human trafficking recently.

Celebrities post pics to support Irani's #CottonIsCool look,"When you see the likes of Vijender Singh, Amish Tripathi, Kapil Dev and Vasundhara Raje posting pictures of themselves wearing kurtas/sarees, it does spike intrigue, quite naturally. On a closer look, we discover that these sports celebrities, politicians and authors are just part of a larger virtual wave started by our Minister of Textiles, Smriti Irani. Earlier today, Smriti posted a picture of herself dressed to the T in a saree, saying she depends on cotton to stay cool in the Indian summer, thus giving birth to the trend #CottonIsCool:I celebrate Indian summers and cotton industry with my #CottonIsCool look. What is your #CottonIsCool look?! pic.twitter.com/wnLcE8jQrxShe then prompted her friends and colleagues to take the wave forward, post pictures of themselves wearing cotton, and further tag 5 more friends to not break the chain.

Why must we? Because not only does cotton keep one cool in the summer, it also gives a big boost to Indian handloom and livelihood to weavers.So, we give you four solid reasons to ditch all other fabrics in the cruel Indian summer and wear cotton everyday:1. It keeps you cool in summers and warm in winters: Basically, cotton provides thermal insulation because the fabric traps air between fibres. Cotton fibres also keep the fabric away from the skin, letting even more air pass through, which helps with insulation.",general,2137,59,70
South Delhi civic body to fine people defecating in open,"To prevent open defecation, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has issued a circular authorising its health and sanitation officials to fine the violators on the spot. The fine amount has been fixed at Rs 50, as per a circular issued by SDMC. All deputy commissioners have been asked to ensure compliance of these directions. The step has been taken in compliance with Supreme Court?s order (in 2000) to recover charges from person littering or throwing rubbish and causing nuisance so as to affect the sanitation and public health, said officials.?Though we have been making all efforts to make our area open defecation free, it is also important to make the people habitual of using public toilet complexes. Unfortunately, people living close to railway tracks still defecate in open. Besides issuing challans, we will educate such people with the help of NGOs,? said South DMC commissioner Puneet Goel.To change the behaviour of public toilet users, the Union ministry of urban development in collaboration of the SDMC launched Swachh Shauchalaya Campaign on Wednesday. It was launched by cricketer Suresh Raina ? one of the Brand Ambassadors of Swachh Bharat Mission. ?More than the construction of public toilets, it is their effective maintenance which is the biggest challenge. Users often don?t flush, leave the toilet dirty and the theft of bulbs, taps, bins, door etc is also common. The campaign aims to change the behaviour, inculcate a sense of responsibility and ownership,? said DS Mishra, secretary UD ministry.

Not fair to think audience doesn't understand art: Shreya,"Shreya Ghoshal has lent her voice to almost all genres of music in Bollywood films and her songs have been well-received too, both by critics and audience alike. In her career spanning 15 years, it seems that the singer has learnt to trust the listeners with their changing demand for music and that?s certainly worked in her favour.?Every time I have sung from my heart and not thought about the commercial aspect, it has done really well for me.

I am not holding on to any thought if I should take up a project or not.

She feels this was the right time for her to take a step towards solo tracks.?It came from my heart that I should go independent from films. Undoubtedly, there?s a lot of scope for good music in films but sometimes, we are confined in that boundary to sing within the story narrative and because it is a film, there are a lot of constraints.

Kailash slams Sonakshi on being chosen for Bieber concert,"Padma Shri award-winning singer-composer Kailash Kher says getting Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha on board to perform at Justin Bieber's maiden concert in India over any other acclaimed Indian singer is not a good sign, and sends a wrong message internationally.The singer added that getting a known Bollywood face has become a trend followed by event managers and producers of the Indian entertainment industry.""I read somewhere that a Canadian singer Justin Bieber is coming to India, and actress Sonakshi will perform at the gig. The news was cute, but quite a lie. It doesn't give a good message internationally,"" said Kher.""They (people from foreign shores) will think that Sonakshi must be a big singer in India. And then she will get concert offers from Canada, and then probably Sonakshi will laugh them off saying 'I am not a singer but an actor',"" Kailash said, over phone from Mumbai about Sonakshi, who made her debut as a singer in 2015 with single Ishqholic, and also judged singing reality show, Indian Idol Junior.He added, ""Whenever any singer from the West comes to India, we get an actor on board to match their level. We don't get singer for another singer, but actor... Event managers and producers of entertainment industry are so scared.""The actress will perform as one of the opening acts at the highly anticipated gig, which will be held at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai on May 10.The Indian award-winning singer feels people tend to give more value to actors instead of singers in India.""Live performances are thought to be more valuable around the world, not actors, but not in India... Indians are very emotional and that is why sometimes they miss out on logic while watching a live gig.""""The organisers don't consider crowd's sensibilities (while deciding on the acts in a live gig), and only go for a popular face. Often actors just come and say 'It is nice to be here'.""Be it for his work in the music industry or association with government initiatives or his endeavours to promote homegrown talent and live musicians, Kailash has expanded his horizon, and earned critical acclaim from all quarters.Hailing from Meerut, Kailash rose to fame after years of struggle in terms of finding shelter in a new city like Mumbai and hardships due to cash crunch.

Shiv Sena slams PM Modi for 'centralising power',"swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe Shiv Sena launched yet another scathing attack on its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through its mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday. In an interview to the newspaper, party chief Uddhav Thackeray attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of ?centralising? power.In a chat with Sena Member of Parliament and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut, Thackeray attacked Modi over his style of functioning, demonetisation, Good and Services Tax (GST) and the PM?s poll pitch ?acche din?. ?The ?acche din? are only limited to government advertisement; the ground reality is completely different. Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister? He is centralising power, instead of decentralising it. He is taking away the independence of the states,? Thackeray said.Thackeray, who has been a staunch critic of demonetisation, said the move has not yielded anything positive, instead, it has affected the livelihood of people. ?Around 15 lakh people lost their jobs because of demonetisation. This means around 60 lakh people were directly affected. You should give them jobs now. How are you going to balance ?Start-up India?, ?Make in India? programmes with such colossal job losses? ? Thackeray asked.He also slammed the state government over the farm loan waiver. Thackeray said the government should table the list of 36 lakh farmers, who were going to get the benefit of the waiver in the upcoming Monsoon session. He said the party would continue its ?dhol bajao andolan? (protest by beating drums) to turn the heat on the government over implementing the loan waiver.Interestingly, the Sena chief said he shares a cordial relationship with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ?There was no personal animosity between me and the current chief minister. My relation with him is really good. Often, he has accepted the suggestions I have given. He is putting forward views of his party, I am representing the people of the state. The difference is only that,? he said.The two parties share an uncomfortable relationship ever since 2014 Assembly polls where they contested independently. Earlier in 2017, the BJP and the Sena parted ways for the Mumbai civic elections. Sena, which is the junior partner in the central and state governments, has never missed an opportunity to speak up against the BJP and the prime minister.

India sends back 47 Pak students over mutilation of soldiers,"Taking a tough stand against Pakistan in the wake of beheading of two Indian soldiers from across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, India has sent back a delegation of students from Pakistan.Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Gopal Baglay said an NGO had invited a group of 47 Pakistan school children accompanied by their teachers as part of a student exchange program.India has advised the NGO that this is not the right time for such exchange programs.The delegation was coming to India on the same day when the Indian army soldiers were killed and their bodies mutilated .In a ceasefire violation, the Pakistan Army had on May 1 opened rocket and mortar firing on two forward posts along the Line of Control. Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT) attacked an Indian joint patrol team and mutilated its two soldiers.Pakistan has denied violating any ceasefire or killing Indian soldiers.Students were to visit Pakistan Embassy The students from Pakistan were scheduled to go on a day-long trip to Agra today and participate in an exchange of experiences with Indian students tomorrow at the Pakistan Embassy here.Expressing regret over the return of the delegation, the NGO Routes2Roots said the trip had to be shortened and the students and teachers have been sent back to Lahore.""Around 50 students aged between 11-15 years along with their teachers arrived in Delhi from Pakistan on May 1 and were supposed to meet their Indian pen friends and hosts of other programs which had to be cut short.""Keeping in view the security and sentiments of fellow Indians the delegation has been sent back to Lahore safely,"" Rakesh Gupta and Tina Vachani, founders of Routes2Roots, said in a statement.In October last year, a similar programme by the NGO was cancelled after the announcement of surgical strike by India along the LoC in September.""Even then as a precautionary measure we cancelled the exchange programme and now the same thing has recurred. If things go well, we will again bring the students, possibly within a month or two,"" Rakesh told PTI.

Telugu actors issued notice to explain link with drug dealer,"The sleuths probing a high-end drug smuggling racket on Wednesday issued notices to some Tollywood personalities seeking their explanation of their alleged links with the arrested narcotics peddlers.The Telangana Prohibition and Excise Department issued notices to some Tollywood actors, directors and producers under section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act asking them to appear before it next week to explain their alleged links with the arrested accused.?We are not revealing their names ... they have been asked to appear before the SIT,? said a senior Excise official.When asked about the grounds on which the notices were issued, the official said, ?Some of the names came out during interrogation of the arrested accused and there were also some evidence against a few others.?After busting the racket selling high-end narcotics like LSD and MDMA, the department has arrested 12 persons till Wednesday since July 2. The latest ones to be arrested in the case were an aerospace engineer who earlier worked for NASA and a businessman.Five of those arrested are B Tech graduates who held good positions in various MNCs.The officials had stumbled upon the Tollywood angle earlier during the investigation when they found that the clientele of the gang comprised nearly 1,000 customers, including students of city-based schools and colleges, a film producer, senior officials of MNCs and employees of IT firms in Cyberabad.The racket hinged around peddling of narcotics like LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and MDMA (methylenedioxy-methamphetamine).The department had earlier seized 800 ?squares? of LSD, each costing Rs 3,000, and 35 grams of MDMA worth Rs 1.4 lakh.LSD, sold in tablets or in liquid form, is known to be one of the most potent ?mood-changing? chemicals, while MDMA, commonly known as ?molly? or ?ecstasy?, is used primarily as a recreational or party drug.The two-member SIT was constituted on July 3.In view of the probe revealing disturbing facts on use of drugs by students, the department had sent advisories to 26 schools and 27 colleges asking their respective managements to sensitise teachers and students against the malady of drug abuse.?First we concentrated on student users and now focus is on other users,? the official added.

What is Chinaman bowling in cricket?,"India were forced to make a change to their one-off Test squad against Bangladesh as Amit Mishra, who injured himself was replaced by Uttar Pradesh and Kolkata Knight Riders' left-arm chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav. Although he is not the first ever Indian chinaman blower as that tag belongs to Preeti Dimri, he became the first ever chinaman bowler to earn a call-up in the Indian Test team. (Also read: India vs Bangladesh one-off Test: Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav replaces injured Amit Mishra)Not only that, he is only the second bowler in Indian cricket currently who belongs to a rare breed. The other one is Shivil Kaushik, who took people by surprise with his Paul Adams-esque ""frog in a blender"" bowling action when he played for the Gujarat Lions last year in the Indian Premier League.WHAT IS CHINAMAN?So what is Chinaman bowling? In layman's term it's basically left-arm leg-spin - the same as right-arm leg-spin. While a leg spinner turns the ball away from the right hander, a chinaman bowler brings it back into him, which can sometimes make life difficult. As a right-handed batsman, your natural instinct is to expect the ball to turn away from you . It's also called left-arm unorthodox spin.This a rare type and is actually considered to be more dangerous because of the sharp turn it generates into a right hander or away from the left hander.VARIATIONS OF A CHINAMAN BOWLERWell, it is traditionally wrist spin. A chinaman bowler has the normal variations of a normal wrist spin bowler. The stock ball comes into the right hander and leaves a left handed batsman. If he possesses ' a 'Googly', the ball is supposed to leave the right hander and come into the left hander. WHY CHINAMAN?The term is traditionally believed to have originated with the former West Indian spinner Ellis Achong. Back in 1933, England hosted West Indies in a Test match in Old Trafford. Achong, said to be a left-arm orthodox spinner or slow left-arm as it is popularly said bowled an unexpected delivery from his wrist which got a sharp turn after pitching outside off and got the English batsman Walter Robins stumped. Achong was the first Test cricketer of Chinese origin and it is believed that a perplexed and angry Robins commented while walking towards the pavilion - ""Fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman.""From then, left-arm wrist spinners have been referred to as chinaman bowlers.HISTORY OF CHINAMAN BOWLINGWell, this is a rare breed all together. So much so that there have been only around 30 of them in international cricket. Out of these only 16 - Achong, Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, George Tribe, Johnny Wardle, Garfield Sobers, Lindsay Kline, Johnny Martin, David Sincock, Inshan Ali, Bernard Julien, Paul Adams, Brad Hogg, Beau Casson, Dave Mohammed, Michael Rippon and Lakshan Sandakan are the ones who made the teams solely due to their bowling.Now one might wonder that what is the legendary Garry Sobers doing in the list? He was a left-arm fast bowler - well, he used to turn his wrist once in a while as well, to add one more dimension to his game. Even Achong, Tribe, Wardle and Martin were not specialised chinaman bowlers as they used to bowl finger spin as well.WHO MADE IT BIG?Not many have mastered the art really. But two people who really made it big are Australia's Hogg and South Africa's Adams.Hogg was always under the shadow of Shane Warne but whenever he got a chance, he performed admirably and slowly became an integral part of two World Cup-winning squads in 2003 and 2007. He has played 123 one-day internationals and picked up 156 wickets. He has also represented the Aussies in seven Tests and 15 T20Is picking up 17 and seven wickets in the process.However, Hoggy has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts since T20 leagues around the world started. The 45-year-old has enjoyed tremendous success in the Big Bash League and the IPL to be specific and is still going strong.Adams on the other hand has played 45 Tests and picked up 134 wickets for South Africa. He also played 24 ODIs, picking up 29 wickets in them.",general,4054,36,70
Tunnels proposed in Arunachal to cut distance to China border,"Itanagar, Jul 24 (PTI) The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will construct two tunnels through 4170-metre-high Sela Pass in Arunachal Pradesh, which would cut down the distance to China border through Tawang by 10 km. ""The tunnels would cut down at least an hour of travel time between the Army?s 4 Corps headquarters at Tezpur and Tawang. Moreover, the tunnels would ensure that NH 13 and especially the 171 km stretch between Bomdila and Tawang, remains accessible in all weather conditions,"" a BRO release said here today. This is in keeping with India?s bid for faster access to the Tibet frontier through the tough terrain of the state in the Eastern Himalayas. RS Rao, the commander of the 42 Border Road Task Force under BRO?s Project Vartak has initiated formal requisition to West Kameng Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sonal Swaroop for acquisition of land for construction of Sela Tunnel, the release said. The project constitutes widening of existing single lane road to NH double lane specifications from Baisaki and then taking off a greenfield alignment of length 12.37 km.

The above alignment has been approved by the Chief Engineer, Project Vartak. There is a shorter but less used road along the Bhutan border via Orang in Assam and Kalaktang in Arunachal Pradesh. ""Due to construction of tunnels across Sela pass the road length reduces by approximately 6.50 km in addition obviates high altitude, steep gradient and hair pin bends on either side of Sela pass which, would bring relief to commuters as lot of hardships have to be faced in winter season due to snowfall at on Sela pass,"" the release said.

Man in Modi mask whips TN farmers in protest in Delhi,"For over a month now, Delhi has been witnessing a bizarre protest at Jantar Mantar. The protesters, who are farmers from Tamil Nadu, have used strategies never heard before ? from wearing skulls, eating mice, conducting mock funerals to even stripping at Raisina Hill. Adding to their eyeball popping agitation this week, a man dressed as Prime Minister Narendra Modi flogged the farmers with a whip. The farmers said the idea was to show Centre?s ?insensitivity? to their plights. ?By ignoring us, it is like Modi is whipping us and trying to beat us out of Delhi? Sometimes I think if we get arrested it might be better. Jail would be better than this,? said P Ayyakkannu, the state president of the National South-Indian Rivers Linking Farmers? Association. At the outset, 25 farmers had volunteered to participate in the flogging, but soon after it began 23 of them backed out. One protester even reportedly fainted because of the pain. Prakash, who carried out the flogging wore one of the popular Modi masks and was dressed in the PM?s trademark jacket and kurta. A protester bites on to a mouse to depict loss of livelihood due to drought. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT PHOTO) These farmers have been in Delhi for 37 days now and are in no mood to leave. Their protest is aimed at getting a relief package from the Centre and having their loans waved off as their crops were ruined in a severe drought and a subsequent cyclone. Their loans from cooperative banks have already been written off, under orders of the state government and the Madras High Court. They have also asked for revised drought packages, that would allow them to buy seeds for the next harvest cycle and also compensate their losses.Protesters use skulls and noose to depict suicides by their fellow farmers. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT FILE) With he mercury going up in the Capital, the protests have also become more taxing. Ayyakkannu shows us the blisters on his thighs from the heat. ?We are sleeping on hot tar while the PM sleeps in an air conditioned room?,? said Palanichamy, a farmer who has been at Jantar Mantar since the beginning of the protests.The farmers claim that they have not been able to meet the Prime Minister. ?This is how they are treating farmers; like slaves,? said Prakash, who used to work in marketing for rice products in Tamil Nadu, before coming over to join the farmers at Jantar Mantar.Protesters strip outside South Block after being unable to meet the President with their demands. (HT FILE) The farmers have, though, met many political leaders, including finance minister Arun Jaitley, water resource minister Uma Bharti, home minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. However, Modi seems to be the one they want to meet. ?Modiji, Modiji. Jantar Mantar aaoji,? rings across the protest grounds.Meanwhile, they are not short of bizarre protest ideas yet. The next in line, is a literally ?deranged? act where they will try to showcase the impact of their current state. By wearing torn clothes and acting unstable they will depict how they have ?lost their minds? in this long battle at Jantar Mantar.",world,3193,53,70

Coral Reef in Mexico to get its own insurance policy,"A stretch of coral reef off Mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.The reef, off the coast of Cancún, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.Coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but their condition has deteriorated in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the acidification of the oceans.Under the Cancún insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, a US environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $1m (£770,000) and $7.5m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a 40 mile (60km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored. If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. The advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. As well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The Cancún scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the ?eco-system services? provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. This is scheduled to be activated in September, with further contracts to be signed in November and December, and full coverage will then begin from next January.?Public-private partnerships are the key,? said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview with the Guardian. He predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the Cancún scheme begins formal operation.?I used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],? said Tercek. ?We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.?Tercek said the Cancún scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be ?very scalable around the world?.A future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change.",science,3560,52,70

Fabindia removing 'Khadi' from products after legal notice,"Fabindia has started removing the brand name Khadi it uses to promote its cotton products after a legal notice by Khadi India that the use of the word amounted to ""unfair trade practice"" and misusing its trade name. Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC) had sent a legal notice to Fabindia Overseas Pvt Ltd, a chain of ethnic wear retail outlet, asking it to immediately stop using the word Khadi from all its cotton products and remove display banners from its showrooms. Sources said Fabindia CEO Viney Singh has responded to KVICs notice, saying it was complying with all the directions of the KVIC. Fabindia has stated that ""as per the direction issued"" by KVIC, it has complied with them, they said. Fabindia, in its reply, has also sought a meeting with KVIC officials to explain its position in order to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of Khadi India. KVIC Chairman V K Saxena, who justified serving the legal notice, referred to the earlier communications with Fabindia by which the private firms application for Khadi mark was treated as closed. He cited a September 29, 2016 letter which stated that ""upon the request of Fabindia, several meetings were held with KVIC and the last meeting was held on August 2, 2016, with Chairman of KVIC at New Delhi. During the meeting, it was assured that Fabindia will communicate their consent shortly. Also read: KVIC sends legal notice to Fabindia for violating regulations on Khadi""Since two months have passed and KVIC has not yet received any response from your end, it is presumed that you are not interested to obtain Khadi mark certificate for sales and promotion of Khadi products. ""Hence in the present circumstances, your application for Khadi mark certificate may please be treated as closed. Henceforth, no correspondence on this subject will be entertained,"" the communication said. KHADI MARK Saxena also drew attention to a February 16 letter of KVIC in which it was decided to issue Khadi mark certificate in favour of Fabindia to carry out trading/selling of genuine Khadi and Khadi products attaching Khadi mark tags/labels, subject to several conditions which were also mentioned. KVIC, which is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, had accused Fabindia of misleading and confusing the consumers by promoting its goods under its registered trade mark Khadi.In the February 8 legal notice addressed to Fabindia's New Delhi-based CEO, KVIC had said, ""You are called upon to explain your position in the above matter within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice, failing which the KVIC will be constrained to proceed against your company as per law for the violation of Khadi Mark Regulation and payment or incidental damages for the losses caused to KVIC by Fabindia.""It also said Fabindia was denied the certificate to use the brand name as it did not adhere to the procedural formalities for Khadi mark certification which was discussed with its representatives.",general,2994,58,70

Mumbai teen allegedly kills self for 'Blue Whale' challenge,"A 14-year-old boy in Andheri, a suburb of Mumbai, killed himself this weekend, jumping off the terrace of his seven-floor building on Saturday. Sources within the Mumbai Police tell India Today that the boy is believed to have been addicted to an online game known as 'Blue Whale'. Blue Whale is a challenge-based underground game with a shadowy history, and has previously been linked to suicides in Russia and other countries. However, officially, Mumbai Police has said that it is yet to find the reason behind the 14-year-old Andheri boy's suicide.The boy, a 9th standard student of an international school in Andheri, is survived by his parents and two sisters. He dreamed of becoming a pilot and had expressed a desire to go to Russia for training. On Saturday, a neighbour from a building adjoining the boy's spotted the teenager on the terrace, walking on parapet while shooting what seemed to be a selfie video. The boy then jumped off and killed himself. The Mumbai Police have registered an accidental death report (ADR) in the matter and have ruled it to be a clear case of suicide.Cops, however, refused to confirm whether the suicide was linked to Blue Whale. Speaking to India Today, DCP Navinchandra Reddy said, ""The parents have not given any information on the reason of suicide, they are in state of shock. We are investigating the case in all possible angles (sic).""BLUE WHALEBlue Whale is a video game said to have originated in Russia and its creator was reportedly arrested by Russian police earlier this year. The game gives players a series of 50 quests, with the final task asking them to commit suicide. The game also asks players to document the completion of each task in the form of photographs. The players are supposed to send the evidence of their completion to the game's administrator who then qualifies them to attempt the next task. Blue Whale's tasks range from the seemingly harmless - watching a scary video at 4 am - to the disturbing - writing/drawing on arms with a sharp object.For the final task, players are directed to jump off a terrace building while, again, documenting the act in the form of photos/video. According to media reports, Blue Whale has spread across several countries and taken lives of hundreds of teenagers. However, the Andheri suicide would likely be the first such case in India.Following the suicide, a WhatsApp message warning parents about Blue Whale has begun to do the rounds in Mumbai. The message, seen by India Today, references the Andheri suicide to say that parents should be wary of handing their children mobile phones or other devices that could allow them to access the online challenge.",general,2673,59,70
"Bankrupt former tennis star's Porsche, Maserati towed away","Just days after being declared bankrupt, Boris Becker suffered another blow when his cars were towed from outside a private club in London earlier this week.According to a report in the Daily Mail, Becker has been slapped with two parking tickets after he left his Porsche Cayenne GTS and his Electric Blue Maserati GHIBLI S outside his South Kensington private member's club.The former German tennis star Becker was declared bankrupt by a court in London after failing to pay a ""substantial"" long-standing debt since 2015.Lawyers for the the three-time Wimbledon champion pleaded with a Bankruptcy Court registrar last week to allow Becker a ""last chance"" to pay off the debt.But Registrar Christine Derrett, who recalled watching Becker play on Centre Court, ruled there was a lack of credible evidence the outstanding payment would be forthcoming and refused to adjourn the case.""One has the impression of a man with his head in the sand,"" she said of the six-time major winner after making the bankruptcy order following a brief hearing.The bankruptcy application was made by private bankers Arbuthnot Latham and Co. in connection with a judgment debt owed them by Becker dating back to 2015.The German's lawyers had argued there was sufficient evidence to show that he would be able to pay the debt soon through a refinancing arrangement, involving remortgaging a property in Mallorca, which was expected to raise six million euros (6.7 million).His advocate told the registrar his instructions from Becker were that it was expected the deal would be approved by a Spanish bank in approximately one month.Becker's advocate said his client was not likely to benefit from bankruptcy and it could have an adverse effect on his ""image"".",general,1737,58,70
Drinking water standards have improved in India: WWC,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, May 6 (PTI) The standard of drinking water in India has improved in the last five years but a lot of work still remains to be done, the head of the World Water Council has said. World Water Council (WWC) recently carried out a major survey on water awareness in major parts of the world, including India. The survey was done ahead of the 8th World Water Forum that is scheduled to take place in the Brazilian capital Brasilia in March 2018. As per the survey, more than one-third of Indians think that not enough is being done to achieve the UNs Sustainable Development Goals to make water and sanitation for all a reality by 2030, World Water Council president Benedito Braga said. ""There has been some work done in the past five years to improve the drinking water standards in India. Of course, theres still a lot of work to do there,"" Braga told PTI. Braga said more than three quarters of the Asians were convinced that governments need to lead the fight to make global access to safe drinking water and sanitation reality. According to the survey, 31 per cent of Indians said they had been in a situation where it was unsafe to drink water but they had no other choice and suffered from diseases like diarrhoea and gastroenteritis. A majority (71 per cent) of Indians said that safe drinking water had improved over the last five years. The survey stated that 62 per cent of the Indians said they believed that the government was doing enough to support access to safe drinking water. Referring to the Swachha Bharat Campaign, Braga praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts towards clean drinking water and sanitation. ""I think Mr Modi is very much concerned with water and sanitation issues. He has even appointed a special secretary in the ministry of water resources to deal with the Ganga River cleanup,"" he said. ""I understand there is a major effort from the current aid in government towards improving water and sanitation access in the country. Thats my perception,"" Braga said.",general,2034,52,70

Cannot relax noise rules during Ganpati festival: Bombay HC,"The Bombay high court on Thursday cautioned the state government against any relaxation in noise pollution rules during festivities like Ganpati and Navratri.A division bench of justice Abhay Oka and justice Vibha Kankanwadi said the state government cannot take ?any adverse decision? ? decision going against the judgment of the high court that says no loudspeaker or other sound amplifier can be used in a silence zone at any hour of the day.The court was hearing a bunch of public interest litigations filed by activists Dr. Yashwant Oke, Sumera Abdulali of Aawaz Foundation and Thane-based activist Dr. Mahesh Bedekar complaining about frequent violations of the Noise Pollution Rules, 2000, especially during public celebrations of religious festivals and the inaction of authorities even if complaints were lodged.The comment came after Abdulali?s counsel, advocate Rohaan Cama, said the state government?s move to seek rule relaxation was completely contrary to the law laid down by the high court and confirmed by the Supreme Court.He also highlighted the need to take strict action against unnecessary honking and urged the court to order the state to undertake special drives to curb the menace.Responding to the plea, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the road transport department and the traffic police will conduct workshops for taxi drivers, including drivers of Ola and Uber cabs, and autorickshaw drivers.Cama also said the need to issue appropriate directions to curb noise from construction sites. In this regard, the court directed the state to issue directions to all planning authorities across the state to incorporate the conditions ? of adhering to provisions of the Noise Pollution Rules, 2000 ? while granting permissions.The court also directed the state to seek a report from NEERI describing the process and procedure to carry out noise mapping in 27 cities across Maharashtra, which include urban areas within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Nagpur.Read more:Maharashtra government wants noise norms to be relaxed during Ganpati",general,2072,59,70

Artistes refuse to perform at Trump's inauguration event,"As unsettling as it might be, Donald Trump is America's President-elect.

Reportedly, several A-list artistes have denied to perform at the event that kicks off on January 19, 2017.

Wonder Woman loses job as UN ambassador,"The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism.The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. Among its key aims were challenging female stereotypes and fighting discrimination and violence against women and girls.But the appointment prompted an angry backlash from some quarters. More than 44,000 people signed a petition that claimed to have been started by ?concerned United Nations staff members? which called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to appoint a non-fictional woman to the role.?It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,? the petition?s authors wrote.Her scanty clothing ? ?a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots? ? meant that deploying her as a role model for the UN was culturally insensitive in many parts of the world, the petition added.Wonder Woman?s tenure as an honorary ambassador was launched on 21 October with an event that saw a silent protest by audience members who turned their backs on the panel, which included current and former Wonder Woman actors Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter.Others protested in the lobby, holding up signs that said ?I?m not a mascot? and ?Let?s get real?.Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, the Warner Bros subsidiary behind Wonder Woman, told the event the campaign would feature various initiatives ?over the course of the next year?, suggesting that the partnership was envisaged to last into 2017.But now the UN has confirmed Wonder Woman?s time as an honorary ambassador will end this week. ?From the UN?s side, there was no plan for it to be much longer than this,? said Jeffrey Brez, the UN?s chief of NGO relations and advocacy.DC Entertainment had approached the UN to explore a joint project to mark the character?s 75th birthday, Brez said. The campaign aimed to harness Wonder Woman?s popularity to allow the UN to target new audiences with its messages on equality for women and girls.The angry response in some quarters prompted the UN to make celebrating the achievements of ?real-life Wonder Women? one of the campaign?s core goals.The collaboration had lasted longer than previous UN roles given to fictional characters, Brez added, pointing out that a character from the video game Angry Birds served as climate change ambassador for a single day in March.Other fictional characters to have been given honorary roles include Winnie the Pooh as honorary ambassador for friendship in 1997, and Tinkerbell as honorary ambassador for ?green? to promote environmental awareness in 2009.Warner Bros and DC Entertainment have been ?extremely pleased? with the partnership?s role in raising awareness of the empowerment of women and girls, a spokeswoman said.?Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her UN honorary ambassadorship.?",world,3206,39,70

Scientists discover the function of human appendix,"Washington, Jan 10 (PTI) The human appendix, which is thought to be of little use to the body, may actually serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria, a new study has found. The appendix, a narrow pouch that projects off the cecum in the digestive system, has a notorious reputation for its tendency to become inflamed (appendicitis), often resulting in surgical removal. Although it is widely viewed as a vestigial organ with little known function, the new study suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. In particular, it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria. Several other mammal species also have an appendix and studying how it evolved and functions in these species may shed light on this mysterious organ in humans. Researchers from the Midwestern University Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US gathered data on the presence or absence of the appendix and other gastrointestinal and environmental traits for 533 mammal species. They mapped the data onto a phylogeny (genetic tree) to track how the appendix has evolved through mammalian evolution, and to try to determine why some species have an appendix while others do not. They discovered that the appendix has evolved independently in several mammal lineages, over 30 separate times, and almost never disappears from a lineage once it has appeared. This suggests that the appendix likely serves an adaptive purpose. Looking at ecological factors, such as diet, climate, how social a species is, and where it lives, they were able to reject several previously proposed hypotheses that have attempted to link the appendix to dietary or environmental factors. Instead, they found that species with an appendix have higher average concentrations of lymphoid (immune) tissue in the cecum. This finding suggests that the appendix may play an important role as a secondary immune organ.",general,1896,50,70
Baby girl delivered by two Delhi policemen in PCR van,"Delhi cops acting as midwives?

To cut a long story short, a PCR van (mobile patrol) arrived, and the woman delivered her baby in the van.?We rushed to the spot on receiving the call. What we saw was a woman, accompanied by her husband, suffering from labour pain. While taking her to the hospital, her water broke and we had to get the baby delivered in the van itself, near Netaji Subhash Marg,? says Inspector Rajendra Sehrawat, who was present during the incident. This is the seventh case of childbirth in the multipurpose vehicle this year. ?This is not new for us.

Sony unveils world's first smartphone with 4K HDR display,"Hot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone. Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read: Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere.",technology,3015,57,70

2 Chinese nationals held for swapping ?34L diamond with fake,"Two Chinese nationals, on Monday, managed to replace a piece of diamond jewellery with a fake one at Mumbai?s India International Jewellery Show. However, swift action by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) led to their arrest at Mumbai airport.The diamond, worth Rs34 lakh, was recovered from a bottle of shampoo.The CISF later also provided security at the India International Jewellery Show (IIJS)-2017, which was being held at Bombay Exhibition Center, Goregaon. ?On July 31, at 3:45 pm, Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) informed us that two Chinese nationals, while trying to strike a deal, cleverly switched and replaced a diamond piece weighing 5.4 carats, approximately costing Rs34 lakhs, with a fake piece,? said a CISF official.As soon as the information was received, a combined team of CISF personnel and council members spread out in the hall to locate the Chinese nationals and prevent them from exiting the venue. Meanwhile, their photographs were also taken from the council registration office and provided at all the gates. Subsequently, their movements were traced through CCTV footage, wherein it was revealed that the two Chinese nationals had already left the show. ?Once it was established that they had left, their passport details, registration details and photographs were taken from the council and sent to the Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) Mumbai and CISF?s airport incharge,? the official added.On the basis of the information, the immigration officials were able to detect the two Chinese nationals who were to board Air India flight AI 314 from Mumbai to Osaka via Delhi-Hongkong scheduled to depart at 7:45 pm. ?It was found that there were not carrying any check in luggage and only two small-shaving kit sized bags were in their possession. The individuals had also changed their clothes from what they were wearing at the exhibition,? the officer said.Because the size of the diamond was small, the X-ray machine could not detect it and therefore, they were then interrogated with the help of a Chinese interpreter, after being off-loaded from the plane.During interrogation, they revealed that the diamond was concealed in a small shampoo bottle, which was subsequently recovered.",general,2253,60,70

Delhi Police framing baseless cases against our leaders: AAP,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday again alleged that the Delhi police was filing ?baseless? and ?fabricated? charges against its leaders. The cases, they said, were failing to stand under the court?s scrutiny. AAP leader Atishi Marlena, while addressing reporters at the party office on Thursday ? a day after Deoli MLA Prakash Jarwal got anticipatory bail in an alleged molestation case ? hit out at Delhi Police for invoking stringent sections of criminal procedure, despite being in the know that the complaints are politically motivated. ?It was clear from the beginning that the complainant was a BJP worker. Still the police invoked section 354 (molestation) deliberately, which was later struck down by the court while granting anticipatory bail to Prakash Jarwal,? said Marlena. The AAP leader argued that the police in the past have repeatedly invoked ?wrong sections? in complaints against other AAP legislators as well, and the cases could not stand court scrutiny. Marlena cited the bail order, which struck down molestation charges, in Jarwal?s case to buttress the party?s charge. ?The complaint to the police for registration of FIR says that the accused touched the dupatta of the complainant and had a scuffle with her. This statement of the complainant not at all suggests that offence u/s 354 IPC has been committed,? the court order reads. ?The complaint itself suggests that the applicant came to the house of the complainant along with 40-50 other persons and started threatening her and her husband and in these facts it is very difficult to assume that the applicant had any intention to outrage the modesty of complainant or had any lust in his mind,? it added.",general,1691,60,70

The fest?s finale was much-awaited, owing to the appearance of singer actor Diljit Dosanjh, but sadly, it did not end well for the crowd and Dosanjh.The singer who had to appear onstage at 5 in the evening had thousands of fans waiting for him at the college grounds since 2 in the afternoon. The singer-actor finally came onstage around 7pm. The excited crowd had already broken barricades, stormed the sides of the stage and had to be repeatedly told to maintain decorum by Diljit?s team and the college authorities.A view of the crowd that had come to see Diljit?s performance at the fest. (Manoj Verma/HT?Photo) By the time Diljit finally came on stage, the crowds had mostly gathered around the stage, breaching almost every level of security possible. The singer urged the crowd to maintain decorum and promised to give them a great performance if they supported him; only to stop mid song and ask a bunch of students near the stage to move back. ?Meri sab to sincere request hai, picche ho jaao. Dilli sayyano da sheher haiga, sayyano waali gal kariye aapa. Masi masi mauka milda show karan da tussi pls hon do properly (I request everyone to move away from the stage.

(Manoj Verma/HT?Photo) However, in an effort to not disappoint the crowd, Dosanjh sang a few hit songs. It was when he was singing his hit Veer Vaar that a leak occurred in a cylinder near the stage and the audience was asked to evacuate the area, which resulted in a stampede. A nearby firework station fell, too, causing a few to suffer mild electric shocks. Dosanjh too had to be escorted to his vehicle, eventually having to leave the venue.

SC orders CBI probe in 62 extra judicial killings in Manipur,"The Supreme Court ordered on Friday a federal investigation into 97 alleged extra-judicial killings in 11 years by security forces in Manipur, overruling objections by the government and the army in a landmark decision hailed by human rights activists.A bench headed by Justice MB Lokur ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to set up a team for the probe and asked the agency?s director to respond within two weeks. The 97 cases were between 2000 and 2011.The army ? which is accused in at least 30 cases ? wanted an internal probe.The court gave the CBI time till by December 31 to lodge cases, complete its investigation and file charge-sheets before an appropriate forum.?These petitions should be listed positively in the second week of January, 2018, to ensure compliance with our directions for investigation by the CBI,? the bench said.In July last year, the top court had ruled that all incidents involving suspected use of excessive and retaliatory force by the army in Manipur must be investigated. The decision had come on a petition that alleged 1,528 staged shootings by the army and other security forces during 2010-12 in Manipur.?The army and paramilitary personnel ?cannot use excessive or retaliatory force? even in areas where the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) had been notified,? the order had said.Manipur police officers will not be included in the special probe team as the state force?s role in the killings has also come under the scanner. The police, the court said, hadn?t registered cases despite complaints by families of victims.The order is a setback for the army. Former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, who was defending the military in court until he retired this year, had argued against reopening the cases for investigation.But the top court rejected Rohatgi?s argument, saying ?death of a person, possibly innocent, cannot be overlooked only because of lapse of time?.The state has an obligation to conduct a thorough inquiry at an appropriate time. However, it cannot take advantage of the delay to scuttle an inquiry, the court said.?Our constitutional jurisprudence does not permit us to shut the door on such persons and our constitutional obligation requires us to give justice and succour to the next of kin of the deceased,? it added.The court also dismissed the Centre?s argument that the affected families were compensated.?This cannot override the law of the land, otherwise all heinous crimes would get settled through payment of monetary compensation,? the bench said.It asked the government not to reduce the National Human Rights Commission into a ?toothless tiger? but obey the panel?s suggestions.?The respect and dignity of the dead and the human rights of all of us will remain only on paper? unless the commission?s guidelines are followed, the bench said.Human rights activists in Manipur welcomed the top court?s directive but also sounded a note of caution about the composition of the investigating team.?It is too early to celebrate,? said Babloo Loitongbam of the Human Rights Alert that along with an association of families filed a petition in the Supreme Court in 2012 on the extra-judicial killings.Advocate and human rights activist Rakesh Meihoubam recalled the case of 12-year-old Azad Khan, allegedly shot dead in front of his parents and villagers, and a handgun planted at the site to label him a militant.

Village adopted by Manoj Tiwari has free WiFi but no water,"Kadipur, a small village in northwest Delhi, has free WiFi facility with 25 servers providing 24-hour internet connectivity. But when it comes to basic civic amenities, the village has nothing to show. The village, with a population of about 800, is battling broken roads, inconsistent water supply and choked drains. Saurav Verma, 18, a student of Delhi University and resident of Kadipur village, has to wake up at 5 in the morning every alternate day, and wait an hour till the water tank is filled up. Verma, and most other residents of the village, say while the WiFi facility may have waited, the government should have first ensured regular water supply, an approach road and improved connectivity.Kadipur was declared a ?free Wi-Fi? village on June 19 by the local councillor Urmila Rana. Villagers access the facility by registering their phone numbers on which they get security code to log in.Delhi BJP chief and Northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari had adopted Kadipur village under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna in 2014.A month after the WiFi facility was launched, Hindustan Times visited the village and found that while the internet facility was working fine, most villagers were disappointed with the civic infrastructure.?We get only two hours of water supply that too every alternate day. It would have been better if the government would fixed this instead of spending on improving internet connectivity,? Verma said.It takes Verma at least two hours to reach Delhi University (North Campus) as connectivity to different parts of the city from the village is poor. The villagers have to hail shared vans to reach the main road 5 km away from where they get transport. Though the internal roads were fine, the approach roads to the village are dust bowls with waterlogging at some places.Another resident, who did not wish to be identified, said, ?There are times when we could not sleep whole night because there are warehouses here where movement of trucks continue entire night. We complained to the local councillor but nothing happened.

Can't stop govt from linking bank accounts with Aadhaar: SC,"The Supreme Court today said the Aadhaar card can't be made mandatory by the government for extending the benefits of its welfare schemes to the people.The apex court, however, said the government cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar - or the the unique identification number - in other schemes like the opening of bank accounts.Last week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the Aadhaar card may become the only identity card in future, and will be mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns to curb tax evasion and frauds.Replying to the debate on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said that Aadhaar may become the only card in future replacing all other types of identity cards such as Voter ID and PAN cards.The government has also said the Aadhaar card is a must for anyone seeking to obtain or renew a driver's license, a new telephone number as well as for existing connections to stay operational after February 2018. In a controversial decision, it has also been mandated for children to get their mid-day meals and for 11 other government schemes.The critics of Aadhaar claim the government is violating a Supreme Court order of October 2015 which specified that the Universal Identification Document cannot be made mandatory for government schemes. The Supreme Court today said it will set up a seven-judge bench to hear the pleas challenging Aadhaar.

Swedish train named 'Trainy McTrainface' after public vote,"It?s happened again. A public vote to name four trains running between the Swedish cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg has resulted in one of the four being called Trainy McTrainface in an echo of the name chosen by the British public for the new polar research vessel.Trainy McTrainface received 49% of the votes in a poll, jointly run by Swedish rail company MTR Express and Swedish newspaper Metro.That placed it well ahead the other three options: Hakan, Miriam and Poseidon.The other trains have already been named by the public: one is named Estelle, after the five-year-old daughter of Sweden?s Princess Victoria, the next in line to the Swedish throne.Another is named Glenn, after a long-running joke that everyone in Gothenburg is called Glenn. The joke has a basis in fact: the name is particularly common in the city and its surrounding area, with its popularity stemming from the 1980s, when local football team IFK Göteborg had four players all called Glenn in its lineup. Forty-three per cent of voters supported the name Glenn.The fourth train has yet to be named. A fifth train, Ingvar, after the Swedish TV personality Ingvar Oldsberg, was named before voting began.The public vote was eventually overruled in the case of Boaty McBoatface and the ship named the RRS Sir David Attenborough, with an onboard submersible receiving the Boatface appellation.MTR Express said the McBoatface decision had led to disappointment worldwide and it hoped the name Trainy McTrainface would ?be received with joy by many, not only in Sweden?.",world,1545,58,70

CBSE textbook says perfect female figure is '36-24-36',"What is the perfect body type? A Class 12 textbook meant for Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students is putting all speculation over that question to rest, declaring authoritatively that the much-celebrated 36-24-36 figure is, in fact, the ""best"" body shape for females.It's not all hyperbole, though. The textbook, which The News Minute reports is titled Health and Physical Education Textbook, goes on to reason that even Miss World and Miss Universe beauty pageants take the 36-24-36 body shape into consideration while judging their contestants.An image of the section of the textbook comparing the physical and anatomical differences between males and females was initially posted on social media by a Twitter user named Anuj Khurana.The textbook doesn't stop at just female body shapes. A cursory sentence in the section on 'Differences in shape' says that when it comes to males, the 'V' body shape is considered the best.According to The News Minute, the textbook has published by the New Saraswati House and not the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), which usually brings out textbooks used in CBSE schools.After reports of the textbook started coming to light, the CBSE issued a clarification saying schools must take responsibility if they choose to include books of private publishers in their curriculum. The CBSE has been in the news recently for seemingly controversial content that has appeared in its textbooks or examination papers.Just a week ago, Class 12 students appearing for their biology examinations, were asked to answer which practice between burial and cremation was better.

Indiscipline in armed forces to be viewed ?seriously?: SC,"New Delhi, Dec 19 (PTI) Indiscipline on part of security force personnel must be ""viewed seriously"" and deserting work by disobeying orders of superior officers is an act of ""gross misconduct"", the Supreme Court has ruled. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur also said that past conduct of a delinquent employee can be taken into consideration while imposing a penalty on him. The courts remarks came as it dealt with a plea filed by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) against the Delhi High Courts August 2014 judgement directing reinstatement of a constable, Abrar Ali, who was dismissed from service due to his alleged acts of indiscipline and misconduct. In its verdict, the apex court held that though Ali was found guilty of deserting the force for a period of five days and not improving his conduct in spite of penalties imposed on him on three earlier occasions, the penalty of dismissal from service is ""excessive and harsh"" and ""in our view, the penalty of compulsory retirement would meet the ends of justice"". The bench, which also comprised Justices D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, said ""indiscipline on the part of a member of an armed force has to be viewed seriously. It is clear that the respondent (Ali) had intentionally disobeyed the orders of his superiors and deserted the force for a period of 5 days. Such desertion is an act of gross misconduct and the respondent deserves to be punished suitably."" The bench directed that Ali shall be entitled for notional continuity of service till the date of completion of minimum service required to make him eligible for pension but he will not be entitled for payment of salary and allowances for that period. Ali was appointed as a constable in CISF in September 1990 and in October 1999, an inquiry was proposed against him under the CISF Rules for allegations of misconduct and misbehavior.

"Students, teachers protest over delay in MU results","A group 50 students and teachers on Monday staged protested at the University of Mumbai?s (MU?s) campus,Fort, against the delay in declaring degree college results. The protesters, led by Bombay University and College Teachers? Union (BUCTU), criticised the varsity?s failure in assessing papers and declaring results within 45 days of examination ? as required by the law. They also voiced opposition to what they termed as ?extreme harassment of examiners? by issuing ? threatening? letters to them.This year, the MU adopted an on-screen marking process for assessing answersheets against the traditional pen-and-paper evaluation. The decision caused a delay in declaring results, as the MU could not appoint an agency to conduct on-screen marking for a long time. Even after the process began, the technical glitches in the system slowed down the pace of assessment. After Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, who also serves as chancellor of the public universities in the state, took cognisance of the issue and asked the MU to declare results by July 30, the university tried to speed up the process. Letters were issued to more than 1,000 teachers, who didn?t show up to assess papers, warning them of the consequences of skipping the assessment work.However, the teachers have asked the varsity to revoke the letter. ?It?s not the teachers, but the university which is at fault here.

Sacking Dhoni as Pune captain a third-rate decision: Azhar,"Former India skipper Mohammad Azharuddin has lashed out at the Rising Pune Supergiants franchise for sacking Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain of the team for the upcoming tenth season of the Indian Premier League.""The decision and manner of execution was third-rate and disgraceful. Dhoni has been a jewel in Indian cricket, he has won almost everything in the 8-9 years of his captaincy and even though the franchise can say they run the team with their own money, shouldn't they have seen Dhoni's stature and credibility before first stripping him of captaincy and then not even letting Dhoni the grace?

Gujarat govt canteens to offer meals at ?10 to labourers,"Poll-bound Gujarat has joined the likes of Tamil Nadu,Odisha and Rajasthan by coming out with its own version of canteens for providing meals to the poor at a highly subsidised rate.Under the Shamik Annapurna Yojna launched on Tuesday, labourers will be provided a meal per day at Rs 10. This is probably the first of its kind scheme for labourers, especially the homeless who do not have fuel and utensils for cooking.The meal ? five rotis, mixed vegetable, rice, pickles and green chilies (and desert on Sundays) ? will be served through saffron-coloured stalls. These stalls are at spots near various kadiyanakas (labourer markets).For the time being, some 25,000 labourers will be covered through 83 stalls set up across the state. The government plans to cover over five lakh registered labourers in the future.?No government in the past 60 years thought about addressing issues like the daily food requirement of labourers. Our government has taken an initiative,? chief minister Vijay Rupani, who served piping hot meals to workers at a stall in Narol area of Ahmedabad, said. Each stall has six attendants. While two of them ? donning apron, hand gloves and cap ? are there to prepare and serve food, the job of two others is to check identity cards and collect cash from the beneficiaries. The other two attendants will be managing crowds.Beneficiaries have to produce an identity card, either Aadhaar or voter card, and get themselves registered with the stall from which they wish to buy food every day.?NGOs have been roped in to prepare the meal. This will also help us to maintain the quality,? said an official from the Labour and Employment department. The BJP government in Gujarat will seek a sixth-term in assembly elections scheduled later this year. Subsidised canteens called ?Amma Canteens? launched by former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa proved to be hugely popular and earned her immense political goodwill.

EC fixes date for EVM hackathon after all-party meet,"The Election Commission of India today asked the political parties to feel free to hack their Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) this Sunday or Monday.

Representatives of seven national parties and 48 state parties were invited by the poll panel for the meeting at the Constitution Club in Delhi to reassure the parties that the EVMs cannot be tampered with and were secured. Most Opposition parties did not buy the Election Commission's argument.

Sennheiser launches headphones priced at ?45 lakh in India,"Successor to the legendary Orpheus, audio giant Senheiser's new HE 1 headphones are now available in India. And just like the legendary Orpheus, the new HE 1 will cost you a bomb to own. Senheiser has launched the premium, high-end headphones in India at an alarmingly high price tag of Rs 45,00,000. But, if the HE 1 are anywhere near as close as the headphones they will replace, well, they ought to be expensive. ""For a decade now in the Indian market, Sennheiser has shaped the industry and has been at the cutting edge of audio by continuously re-defining the gold standard of what is technically possible,"" said Sennheiser CEO Daniel Sennheiser. ""With the HE 1, we are once again pushing the boundaries and are showing that we can repeatedly set new benchmarks in excellence and reshape the future of the high-end audio world.""The new HE1 use a completely new amplifier concept that combines the superior impulse processing of a tube amplifier with the low distortion of a transistor amplifier ""to perfection"" according to the company. There are a total of eight vacuum tubes that process the incoming signal. The advantage of tube amplifiers is their superior impulse processing. However, one challenge is their sensitivity to air-borne-noise. For this reason, the amplifier housing is crafted from granular, in homogeneous Carrara marble and is freely suspended with the amplifier. The decoupling of the tubes in combination with the damping properties of the marble has the effect of reducing structure-borne noise to an absolute minimum. The tube amplifier stage is followed by a patented ultra-high impulse amplifier stage that is directly integrated into the cups of the headphones.Senheiser has used gold-vaporised ceramic electrodes in the headphones. The advantage of this design, it says, is the extremely short distance between the amplifier and the diaphragm which is less than one centimetre in the new HE1. Thus, the headphone system requires far less power for charge reversal. At a voltage of only around 5 Volt, the music signal is transmitted balanced to the high-voltage amplifier integrated into the headphones and is amplified there. This ensures extremely high impulse fidelity with relatively low power requirements. Just like the tubes of the tube amplifier, the system's MOS-FET transistors have a square characteristic curve to prevent the hard distortion that occurs in amplifiers with bi-polar transistors.Sennheiser uses a new amplifier concept in a class that the audio specialist calls Cool Class A. In the low-frequency range, Cool Class A provides Class A power at any volume. In the high- and ultrahigh-frequency range, the amplifier switches from Class A to the usual Class AB operation. That will, however, only be the case when listening to a very unusual frequency spectrum.",technology,2819,58,70

He was elected unopposed to the post of vice-president and assumed office on September 3, 1987. He fought the presidential election of 1992 and beat competition from G G Swell and Ram Jethmalani. Shankar Dayal Sharma succeeded R Venkataraman as the president and assumed office on July 25, 1992. 6) K R NarayananShankar Dayal Sharma resigned as vice-president after becoming the President, and elections were announced.

Delhi airport crossed 50-million passenger mark in 2016,"Delhi?s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) broke its own record of highest flight movements in one hour when it handled 82 flights in 60 minutes on November 16. The Air Traffic Controller (ATC) handled 40 landings and 42 take-offs between 11 am and noon on that day, and broke its previous record of 77 flight movements in an hour, officials said.Also, for the first time, the airport crossed the 50-million passenger mark in a year, with 55.65 million passengers, almost 10 million more than the previous year. With traffic growth at almost 20%, airport operator Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) is changing the master plan to increase the capacity of the terminal and the airside. The new ATC tower and fourth runway will help reduce congestion in the air and handle more flights.Read: IndiGo, SpiceJet flights come face-to-face at Delhi?s IGI airportAccording to airport officials, air traffic continues to grow but in 2012-13, due to a dip in domestic traffic, the overall passenger traffic fell to 34.37 million from 35.88 million in the previous year.?As the busiest airport in the fastest growing aviation market, Delhi airport achieved another milestone by crossing a record 50 million passengers in 2016. With this, the Delhi airport has entered the league of 25 busiest airports worldwide. This year, Delhi Airport made yet another record by handling a whopping 82 flight movements in an hour. We look forward to attaining many more milestones in 2017,? said I Prabhakara Rao, CEO-DIAL.The Delhi airport has a major market share of air traffic volume to the Middle East, European, Asian and American regions. It has an annual passenger capacity of over 62 million, including Terminal-3 that can handle 34 million passengers. The airport handles over one lakh passengers every day and aircraft movements have also increased. Almost 1,185 arrivals/departures took place from here everyday. In order to expand the infrastructure and expand Terminal 1, DIAL will shift two domestic low-cost carriers to Terminal 2 by mid-January.As domestic airlines, especially budget carriers, are growing at a faster rate, DIAL has decided to double the capacity of Terminal 1, which now caters to only low-cost carriers. ?We will expand it and in the next three years, the capacity of T-1 will increase from 15 million per annum to 30 million per annum,? Rao added.Read: Delhi airport staff will have to carry Aadhaar card from Jan 1The new Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower of the Delhi airport, which is the country?s tallest ATC tower, is ready and will be operational soon. The tower, which is among the tallest structure in Delhi, will give a 360-degree view of the airport to the controller and will eventually help in on time performance of the flight. The ATC complex and the 60-metre-high tower was built in 1999 and are at a considerable distance from the third runway, constructed in 2008.The tower will give controllers a commanding view of the airport, as well as a much larger working space, so that a larger number of controllers can operate and reduce the pressure on the controllers. The 101.9-metre tower is adjacent to the present ATC tower and once ready, it will be the tallest in the country and the 7th tallest in the world. The Delhi airport, which already has three runways, will become the first airport in the country to have a fourth runway, with construction likely to start this year.

Banks told to give all details on Mallya-Kingfisher bad loan,"In a landmark judgment, the information watchdog Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed a consortium of banks that lent a bad loan to embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines to reveal all the details of not just the loan the company defaulted on, but such information about the approval of the loan that is expected to land several top bank officials in a legal soup.Hailing it as a big victory, RTI activist Harinder Dhingra told Mail Today that it was a lesson to such public authorities and institutions that tried to hide behind the exemption clauses in the RTI Act to ensconse their ""wrongdoings"".The consortium had denied Dhingra much of information about the process that led to ""unwarranted"" granting of loan that eventually went bad.""It is strange that innocuous information pertaining to public money was denied in the name of hampering investigation. It is also strange that the bank does not know of what happened to the money it lent to the company. It doesn't know if the company has been declared a defaulter,"" said Dhingra.While Mail Today was the first to report that such a loan, nearly Rs 55 crore, had been given to Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines by the Oriental Bank of Commerce-led consortium, the latter had been stonewalling giving information regarding who approved the loan and on what grounds, such as collaterals etc, by invoking Section 8 (1) (h) of the RTI Act. The bank had argued that the matter was pending before different investigating agencies and disclosure of the information could hamper the investigation process. The concerned enforcement agencies are the CBI, ED and the SFIO.SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTThe CIC had earlier, at the case hearing on February 10, questioned the invoking of the exemption clause. In its latest judgment in the case, the CIC quoted several judgments from the Supreme Court as well as the Delhi High Court and observed that the bank had to furnish information asked by Dhingra and that the exemption did not apply.IC Sharat Sabharwal observed: ""Except for stating that the matter is under investigation of some agencies, the respondents (bank) have not made any other submission to justify invocation of Section 8 (1) (h) to deny most of the information and why its disclosure would hamper the investigation process. As stated above, the investigation agencies have chosen not to make any submission in spite of an opportunity given to them for the purpose.""The IC also cited that the exemption clause itself made it clear that ""a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.""The IC also quoted, among others, an SC observation in the case of UP Financial Corporation vs gem Cap India Pvt (AIR 1993, 1435). ""In fact, information about industrialists who are loan defaulters of the country may put pressure on such persons to pay their dues.""",general,2918,60,70

"UK teen marries IS fighter over Skype, tries plotting attack","A teenage girl is alleged to have married an Islamic State fighter in Syria via Skype and became so indoctrinated that she tried to get a gun and grenade to stage a terrorist attack against Britain. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with the alleged plot.She is believed to be from a Moroccan background and was aged 16 when she met the alleged Isis terrorist, who originally comes from Coventry, online. He is now believed to be dead, killed in a drone strike in April.The teenager, from London, is accused of receiving instructions on how to use the weapons and asking for help in carrying out the plot. The case is said to have involved explicit foreign direction, and the plotting is alleged to have happened between 1 December 2016 and 12 April 2017.The accused was aged just 16 when she ?married? the Isis fighter via Skype, in an online ceremony. There is considerable doubt that it would be considered valid under either Islamic or British laws. The man is understood to have used the internet and social media including Skype, an online voice and video communications programme.During Wednesday?s short court hearing, her lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, said that the girl would plead not guilty. In court, the teenager, wearing a Nike tracksuit and with her long black hair tied in a ponytail, spoke only to confirm her name and age.District judge Tan Ikram remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 11 August. She will also appear there on the same date in relation to another terror offence for which she had previously been charged.In a statement the Metropolitan police said the teenager had been charged with having ?the intention of committing acts of terrorism engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect the that intention?.The elements of the offence, the Met said, were: ?i. Communicating with a Daesh [Isis] fighter in Syria and arranging to receive weapons in order to conduct an attack in the UK; ii. Receiving instructions on how train and use weapons; iii. Reaching out to another to receive assistance in completing plan.?Last week, Met commissioner Cressida Dick said: ?Six attack planning plots were thwarted in the last four months alone, and we can expect that figure to rise.?Britain?s top police officer added: ?The bulk of this domestic threat seems to be from those who are inspired by overseas networks, though there have undoubtedly been some who have been more directly enabled by them also, and we should not assume that attempts by senior leaderships of overseas groups to direct more or less sophisticated UK attacks have gone away.?The terrorist threat level from Islamist inspired terrorism in Britain remains at severe, meaning that an attack is considered highly likely.

"Virat Kohli is human, he had to fail one day: Sourav Ganguly","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli will come back strongly in the second Test against Australia in Bangalore after a rare failure in Pune.CLICK TO WATCH FULL VIDEOKohli, who has had a record-breaking home season, became the first batsman in history to slam four double hundreds in successive series. However, Kohli fell for a second-ball duck in the first innings, chasing a wide one off Mitchell Starc and then shouldered arms to a straight ball from Steve O'Keefe in the second to record scores of 0 and 13 respectively. (Never challenge Virat Kohli, he will come good in Bengaluru: Harbhajan Singh to India Today)These were Kohli's worst returns at home in a Test where he has batted in both innings, it was his first duck at home and only fifth overall. A couple of off days for the captain meant a staggering 333-run defeat for India. Last week, not even the most ardent Australian fan would have thought that was possible. (Can Virat Kohli's India repeat 2001 heroics vs Australia? Harbhajan Singh and Nayan Mongia recall Kolkata miracle)But Ganguly said Kohli was only human and he was bound to have one off-day. ""Kohli is human and he had to fail one day. He failed in both innings in Pune. I think he played a little bit of a loose shot in the first innings outside the off stump but the Australians bowled him there,"" Ganguly told India Today. ""They must have seen Stuart Broad and James Anderson bowling to him in England outside the off stump. In the second innings, I think the game was already over. A 441-run target was a humongous task. Kohli will come back because he is a class act. His record against Australia is unreal,"" he said.

Google removing people's medical records from search results,"Google has started removing private medical records from its search results, after adjusting its policy regarding personal information.The change was made on Thursday to include the ?confidential, personal medical records of private people? in the bracket of information Google may remove unprompted from search results. Other examples of such information include national or government issued identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and images of signatures.The leaking of private medical records can be extremely damaging to the victims, both financially and emotionally, with future prospects affected and private lives of the vulnerable exposed. Given that Google?s indexing system will capture anything that?s publicly accessible on the internet, leaks such as those created by an Indian pathology lab which uploaded more than 43,000 patient records in December, including names and HIV blood test results, can be particularly damaging.The last change to the removal policy was made in 2015 with the addition of ?nude or sexually explicit images that were uploaded or shared without your consent? to cover so-called revenge porn.The new addition to Google?s scrubbing policy marks a change from the search company?s traditional hands-off, algorithmic approach which resists attempts at censorship. This has come under scrutiny over the last few years due to the spread of fake news and misinformation. Google recently adjusted its search results to down-rank contested information such as fake news.For many Google has become the gateway to the internet, meaning that removal from the company?s search results effectively scrubs them from the internet. While the information will still be accessible via other search engines or directly, other associated actions including the European right to be forgotten have seen being removed from Google?s search results as good enough to affect change.Google has recently come under fire for its search and services such as YouTube being used to spread extremist content, as well as its ad network being used to fund sites dedicated to spreading hate speech and propaganda. The company introduced new measures for YouTube to tackle the spread of terrorist material, while its head of European operations apologised after adverts for major brands appeared next to extremist material.",technology,2354,60,70

Scientists eliminate HIV infection in 'humanised' mice,"New York, May 2 (PTI) Scientists have successfully removed HIV DNA from the genomes of animals - including a humanised mice - using a powerful gene-editing tool, an advance that may help eliminate the virus in humans in future. The team is the first to demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication can be completely shut down and the virus eliminated from infected cells in animals with a powerful gene editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas9. Researchers, including those from Temple University in the US, build on their previous study in which they used transgenic rat and mouse models with HIV-1 DNA incorporated into the genome of every tissue of the animals bodies. They demonstrated that their strategy could delete the targeted fragments of HIV-1 from the genome in most tissues in the experimental animals. The researchers genetically inactivated HIV-1 in transgenic mice, reducing the RNA expression of viral genes by roughly 60 to 95 per cent. They then tested their system in mice acutely infected with EcoHIV, the mouse equivalent of human HIV-1. In the third animal model, latent HIV-1 infection was recapitulated in humanised mice engrafted with human immune cells, including T cells, followed by HIV-1 infection. In all three animal models, the researchers utilised a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector delivery system based on a subtype known as AAV-DJ/8. ""The AAV-DJ/8 subtype combines multiple serotypes, giving us a broader range of cell targets for the delivery of our CRISPR/Cas9 system,"" said Wenhui Hu, associate professor at Temple University.

The second instalment of 1997 hit film Judwaa has cameo of Salman and he recently shot for a song with Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee. ?It is essential to work with actors or actress including Khans or not Khans as they have a higher market value.

Mumbai's 'kaali-peeli' drivers oppose plan to install GPS,"The decision to install a Global Positioning System (GPS) has not gone well with the taxi unions. The two biggest taxi unions of the city have opposed the plan for black and yellow cabs if it puts a financial burden on their members.Mumbai Taximens Union and Mumbai Taxi Association have opposed the plan to install GPS citing additional expenses. ?The government has made speed governors mandatory for taxis and is now asking to install the GPS device. Who will bear the financial burden?? questioned Prem Singh, leader of Mumbai Taxi Association. Last week, Ranjit Patil, Minister of State for Home, said in the legislative assembly that conventional auto rickshaws and taxis will have to install GPS systems on the lines of app-based aggregators such as Ola and Uber, considering the safety of the passengers. He was replying to the issue raised by the leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil through a calling attention motion. The government needed to ensure that black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws had devices that can help track them.The government also wanted to install GPS in taxis and autorickshaws so that they could be tracked from the control room. The unions, however, claimed that they had brought their own taxi booking app, through which most of their taxis could be tracked.?There has not been a molestation in black and yellow taxis and therefore it is one of the safest transport modes for women,? said AL Quadros, leader of Mumbai Taximens Union. He added that if the government wanted to install GPS in taxis, they should release funds under the Nirbhaya scheme.The unions also slammed the state government, claiming that it completely failed to maintain law and order and controlling crimes in the city.Mumbai has around 45,000 black and yellow taxisREADPanel wants more time to submit report on taxi fares to Maharashtra govt Mumbai RTOs deserted after crackdown on unauthorised agents, touts begins",politics,1936,58,70
Vehicles consume 1.5 times more fuel on crowded roads: Study,"If you drive a car in Delhi and its suburbs then bad and crowded roads are burning a big hole in your pocket.An ongoing study on how much fuel is wasted because of potholed roads and bad traffic has found that vehicles travelling on ?average?, crowded roads consumed nearly one-and-a-half time more fuel per kilometre compared to ?good?, fuel-efficient roads. The figure is expected to rise to three times during the next phase of the study to be conducted on inferior road stretches.The study, commissioned in May, released its preliminary findings last week involving a Sports Utility Vehicle with a mileage of 10 -12 km/litre. Subsequent tests will be conducted with small cars and loaded and empty trucks. The findings use a three-tier grading system to assess road conditions. Traffic congestion is also a parameter.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) conducted the study. It was found that an SUV consumed about 40.25 millilitres of fuel per kilometre when it travelled on the Noida Expressway, considered a good, fuel-efficient road. The same vehicle consumed about 95.5 millilitres of fuel for every kilometre when travelling from Noida Expressway to Kalindi Kunj and onto Jasola.The consumption was even higher at 137.2 millilitres per km when the vehicle travelled from Botanical Garden to Kailash Hospital in Noida. ?The initial findings of the study conducted on two road stretches in Delhi have revealed that Delhiites could be consuming at least two-to-three times more fuel because of bad quality roads and traffic conditions,? said Ravindra Kumar, principal scientist of CRRI?s transport and planning division.?The result is they end up paying more.?A preliminary estimate puts the wastage across India at Rs 960 crore a day. Although the extra expense incurred by an individual driver might not ring alarm bells, the cumulative wastage would be an added burden on India?s oil imports bill.The initial study was carried out on more than 600 km of the best roads in Delhi and its suburbs such as the Yamuna Expressway, Delhi Gurgaon Expressway and NH24 to collect the baseline data ? the best fuel-efficient roads. ?Now we are driving the same vehicles on various roads of Delhi to find out how much extra fuel they consume,?

Sachin recollects how Lillee made him give up fast bowling,"Former Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee turned 68 on Tuesday and while there were a number of wishes from former cricketers and fans across social media, the most iconic one came from a legend of the game who admitted that he ?pretended to be a Dennis Lillee in the nets?.What made it iconic is that the legend is none other than former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar. With over 34,000 runs to his name in his international career, Tendulkar is regarded as arguably the best batsman in the history of the game with comparisons drawn alongside the legendary Sir Don Bradman. It isn?t a secret anymore that Tendulkar wanted to be a fast bowler at one point, but that didn?t happen, and instead he rolled his arms as a part-time leg-spinner later in his career.READ?| Ravichandran Ashwin fastest to 250 Test scalps, breaks Dennis Lillee?s recordIn a video posted on Facebook by Tendulkar late on Tuesday night, he wishes Lillee on his birthday before stating: ?I can?t ever forget the day I met you in Chennai in 1987. I was there to become a fast bowler, but this is something most of the guys don?t know. I was always a batter but while catching the train from Mumbai to Chennai, my brother told me ?It won?t be a bad idea to carry your batting gear because after bowling for a while, you might be standing there doing nothing. And that time you can pad up and play against all those fast bowlers.? I actually ended up doing that for the rest of the week. You correctly said ?I think this young lad should go out and bat and forget about bowling.??Well, Lillee seemed to have seen the talent hidden in that 16-year-old back then and the rest is history. However, Tendulkar admits that it wasn?t the end of his dreams of becoming a fast bowler and added: ?But that desire continued and instead of bowling in matches, I used to fulfill all my desires at the nets, bowling from 17 yards (and) sometimes also pretended to be a Dennis Lillee at the nets.?",sports,1953,58,70

Hizbul militant Bhat hid for 10 hrs during encounter: Report,"Sabzar Ahmad Bhat, the slain Hizbul commander who routinely released his photographs in combat gear for social media, was no braveheart. Details emerging about the terrorist's last moments point at his being more adept at shooting from a smartphone than the Kalashnikov on his shoulder.Senior Army sources, privy to the operation in which Bhat was cornered and neutralised in Tral area of Kashmir's Pulwama district last Saturday, told Mail Today that the 27-year-old terrorist remained in hiding for nearly 10 hours, without firing a single bullet at the troops.Bhat also frantically sent text messages from his handset to gather a crowd of stone-pelters at the encounter site to provide him cover, the sources said.HOW DID ARMY TRACK SABZARSecurity forces had tracked down Bhat's location using technical intelligence provided to the troops on ground by the Jammu and Kashmir police cells. These units have been successful in nailing a large number of terrorists in recent years.""The intelligence provided by the police confirmed that Sabzar and Faizan were in a cluster of houses in Saimoo village in Tral area and we laid a cordon on Friday evening around his house,"" senior Army sources said. The raiding party included Army, Special Operations Groups and state police troops.After laying the cordon, the troops tried to establish contact with Sabzar and his category A accomplice Faizan. There was no retaliation or firing from the terrorists in hiding as forces suspect the two did not want to give away their positions.A large number of weapons including an AK-47 and INSAS assault rifles along with a huge cache of ammunition and other warlike stores, were recovered from the hideout after the operation was over.After failing to establish contact with terrorists, the raiding team decided to ""smoke out the rats"" and called for fire tenders filled with petrol instead of water.STONE PELTERS TO RESCUE?Meanwhile, Bhat and his accomplice were trying to gather a crowd of stonepelters to be able to escape from the encounter location but the late hours did not get them much help. Sources said their messages betrayed desperation and fear.""Petrol was poured inside the first house using hose pipes and it was set on fire but the two did not react. The result in the second house was also the same. But when the troops poured in petrol in the third house around 8:15 am, the two ran out of the house and tried to breach the cordon,"" the sources said. Before Bhat could open fire, the troops fired a hail of bullets. Within a few seconds, the two ""propagandist terrorists"" were lying dead on the ground.Army sources said Sabzar, a Class 7 dropout, was a known womaniser and drug addict at the time of his joining the Hizbul Mujahidden two years back. He replaced Burhan Wani who had been killed last year by the Army in South Kashmir.Both the terrorists were tracked by technical intelligence sleuths and killed in similar brief encounters. Sources said in Burhan's case too, the terrorist was trapped when the technical cells of Jammu and Kashmir police had followed a terrorist named Sartaj and did not know about Burhan's presence there.However, in Sabzar's case, they were tracking him directly and were sure about his presence in the Tral area.Sources said the recent crop of local terrorists is high on propaganda and try to conjure up a hero-like status by spreading their pictures on social media in full combat gear. ""Little do they know that this act of theirs is of big help for security forces in identifying them and locating them,"" the sources said.As part of Pakistan's strategy, local terrorists, who are not even trained formally into firing and combat tactics, are being used as cannon fodder to keep the militancy in J&K alive.Also Read",general,3760,60,70

"Princess Diana tried to cut wrist after wedding, claim tapes","Diana was so unhappy in the few weeks after her fairy tale wedding with Prince Charles that she tried to slash her wrists, according to the transcripts of secret tapes of the popular princess. The shock revelations were made in a book about her battles with depression, life with Charles and his lover Camilla . ""I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades,"" The Princess of Wales is quoted as saying. The ""suicide"" tapes - are believed to have recorded in 1991 with the help of a friend - and have remained secret for 20 years, The Sun reported. But they are now being used in a republished version of Andrew Morton?s book: Diana- Her True Story. Diana in the tapes tells how life became a misery after life in Balmoral during their honeymoon. ""I got terribly, terribly thin. People started commenting: Your bones are showing. By October (1981) I was in a very bad way,"" she said. ""I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades. It rained and rained and rained. I came down early (to London) to seek treatment, not because I hated Balmoral, but because I was in such a bad way. ""I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades,? she was quoted as saying. In the original book Morton had revealed the suicide attempts - but had quoted ""friends"". Now the new edition reveals that it was Diana who had spoken candidly about how quickly the marriage had fallen apart. She also reveals how she kept looking for Camilla Parker Bowles, her love rival, even as she walked down the aisle at her wedding. ""As I walked up the aisle, I was looking for Camilla. I knew she was in there. ""I had a very bad fit of bulimia the night before. I ate everything I could possibly find which amused my sister (Jane) because she was staying at Clarence House with me. ""On the day, there was great anticipation. Happiness because the crowds buoyed you up ? but I don?t think I was happy."" Diana said she was in love with Charles and ""could not take my eyes off him"" . ""I just absolutely thought I was the luckiest girl in the world. He was going to look after me. Well, was I wrong on that assumption! ""So walking back down the aisle, I spotted Camilla ? pale grey, veiled pillbox hat, saw it all, her son Tom standing on a chair. To this day, you know ? vivid memory,"" she was quoting as saying. On her honeymoon she reveals she suffered ""appalling dreams"", adding: At night, I dreamt of Camilla the whole time. ""I was obsessed by Camilla totally. I didn't trust (Charles), thought every five minutes he was ringing her up, asking how to handle his marriage."" Diana remained the object of worldwide media scrutiny during and after her marriage, which ended in divorce on August 28, 1996. She was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 at the age of 36 along with Dodi Fayed.Also Read: Have you noticed this one glaring thing in all of Prince Charles and Princess Diana's photos?US tabloid claims Prince Charles is gay, splashes photos of scandalous 'kiss'",general,3018,60,70
Plane makes emergency landing after mid-air brawl,"London, Jan 15 (PTI) An ugly fistfight erupted on a packed London-bound flight at 30,000 feet after an air hostess was assaulted, prompting an emergency landing in Istanbul. The Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut was forced to make the emergency landing in Istanbuls Ataturk Airport after the argument broke out. An elderly man, named only as Z A Sh, reportedly began shouting and swearing at his wife, before he punched a fellow passenger. Cabin crew rushed to break up the fight, but the man ""violently"" shoved one of them away and punched another, The Mirror reported. The young man seen in the video of the brawl, with a beard and dark hair, then raced over to help the air hostesses.

16 cases of train sabotage cases in 2017 so far: Report,"Terming it as 'abnormally high', a top Railways official told India Today that most of these instances have occurred in non-traditional left wing extremism (LWE) affected areas, and do not carry the signature of Maoist subversive activities. ""There were 45 incidents in 2016 including 7 blasts, 3 instances of track tampering, 27 cases of sabotage and attempt to sabotage and 8 agitation related incidents. In 2017, in the first 40 days there have already been 16 cases and this is abnormally high,"" Mohammed Jamshed, Member Traffic, Railway Board told India Today.The stunning revelation by Bihar police about a suspected Pakistan's notorious counter intelligence agency ISI plot to spread terror on the rail tracks has led to Railways transfer sensitive cases to the NIA. ""Explosives kept at the track in East Champaran, the derailment of the Patna-Indore express on November 21 near Kanpur and the Koneru derailment have all been referred to the NIA,"" sources said. Subsequently with iron rails being found placed across the railway track, to cause derailment of another train in Mumbai, the CBI has been roped in to probe the matter. On Saturday, Gelatin sticks were found next to the railway track near Mumbai prompting the Railways and Maharashtra police to launch investigations. The Indian Railways is spread over 1,10,000 track kilometers across the country. ""There are three traditional trouble spots. The North Frontier pocket - Upper Assam has Bodo and ULFA agitation. The Asansol to Gaya track and the Dantewada-Jagdalpur track where Maoists carry out their subversive activities are 3 pockets of trouble. However, more often than note, Maoists issue a warning in advance before they remove fish plate or destroy rail tracks. Their aim appears to be to cause more damage to infrastructure than people,"" sources added. What is alarming this time is the loss of life and no one claiming responsibility for the incidents. Like the one in Mumbai, there have been instances of big boulders being brought from elsewhere and deliberately put on tracks. Also read: Terror angle in Kanpur train tragedy: NIA, IB on hunt for recruiter in derailment casesKANPUR TRAIN TRAGEDYThe NIA has sought cooperation from the Nepal police in connection with the interrogation of Shamul Hoda, a suspected ISI operative arrested in Dubai and deported to Nepal late last week. Hoda is suspected to be the mastermind of an ISI plot to derail trains and cause massive loss of life in India. The Bihar police initially busted three people - Motilal Paswan, Umashankar Patel and Mukesh Yadav for reportedly planting explosives on the rail track in east Champaran. Fortunately the explosives were detected and a tragedy averted. On sustained interrogation the three confessed to having allegedly been paid by Brij Kishore Giri, their handler in Nepal who in turn had been paid by Shafi Sheikh and Shamsul Hoda. According to officials in the Bihar police, the three had been paid Rs 3 lakh each for planting the explosives. Simultaneous investigations by the Nepal police revealed that Arun and Deepak Ram were killed on Hoda's instructions for refusing to blast rail tracks and kill people. ""Apparently Hoda did not want to leave any trail. Since both Arun and Deepak Ram knew of the plot and refused to carry it out, they were eliminated,"" sources said. Investigators painstakingly tracked down Hoda in Dubai and intelligence officials kept an eye on his movement and phone conversations. In one conversation Hoda spelt out the plan to derail trains and kill people, the intelligence officials passed on the audio link to their counterparts in the middle-east. ""Hoda was deported to Nepal where the police arrested him for the murder of Arun and Deepak Ram. He is currently being questioned and may be brought face to face with the other suspects in the case to unravel the entire plot,"" sources added. A team of NIA sleuths is also travelling to Nepal to question Hoda in connection with the Kanpur and Koneru derailments. But with 1,10,000 kilometers of railway track across the country vulnerable to subversive and anti-national elements, the Railways is now desperately working to devise ways to secure the rail line.

Banks not responsible for loss of valuables in locker: RBI,"Do not expect any compensation for theft or burglary of valuables in safe deposit boxes of public sector banks as the locker hiring agreement absolves them of all liability. This bitter truth was disclosed in an RTI response by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and 19 PSU banks. Stung by the revelation, the lawyer who had sought information under the transparency law has now moved the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging ""cartelisation"" and ""anti-competitive practices"" by the banks in respect of the locker service. He has informed the CCI that the RTI response from the RBI has said it has not issued any specific direction in this regard or prescribed any parameters to assess the loss suffered by a customer. Even under the RTI response, all public sectors banks have washed their hands of any responsibility. According to the information availed by the lawyer, the unanimous reason given by the 19 banks, including Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Punjab National Bank, UCO and Canara, among others, is that ""the relationship they have with customers with regard to lockers is that of lessee (landlord) and lessor (tenant)"". The banks have contended that in such a relationship, the lessor is responsible for his or her valuables kept in the locker which is owned by the bank. Some banks, in their locker hiring agreements, have made it clear that any item stored in the locker is at the customers own risk and he or she may, in their own interest, insure the valuables. The common feature of all locker hiring agreements states, ""As per safe deposit memorandum of hiring locker, the bank will not be responsible for any loss or damage of the contents kept in the safe deposit vault as a result of any act of war or civil disorder or theft or burglary and the contents will be kept by the hirer at his or her sole risk and responsibility. ""While the bank will exercise all such normal precautions, it does not accept any liability or responsibility for any loss or damage whatsoever sustained to items deposited with it. Accordingly, hirers are advised in their own interest to insure any item of value deposited in a safe deposit locker in the bank,"" they have said. Aggrieved by the responses, the lawyer -- Kush Kalra -- raised questions before the CCI -- why not just keep the valuables at home after insuring them, instead of paying rent to the bank for a locker when it is not going to take any responsibility for the contents. He alleged that all these banks, also including State Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Syndicate Bank, Allahabad Bank and others, have formed a ""cartel"" to indulge in such ""anti-competitive"" practices. He further alleged that the bank by forming an association or cartel are ""trying to limit the improvement of services which is directly affecting the competition in the market and interests of the consumer"". The lawyer has sought a probe under the Competition Act into the allegation of cartelisation by the banks in respect of the locker service.",general,3013,58,70

Saudi increases India's Haj quota by biggest margin in 29yrs,"Saudi Arabia has increased India's annual Haj quota from 1.36 lakh to 1.70 lakh, biggest such expansion in last 29 years, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said today. An agreement to this regard was inked by Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) Naqvi with Saudi Arabias Haj and Umrah Minister Dr Mohammad Saleh bin Taher Benten at Jeddah today, making the expansion effective from the current year. The Saudi authorities had five years ago slashed quotas for foreign pilgrims coming from each country by 20 per cent in view of safety of the devotees as they undertook expansion of Grand Mosque there. Accordingly, India's quota was brought down to 1.36 lakh from nearly 1.70 lakh in 2012. Expressing pleasure at signing of the agreement, Naqvi said his meeting with Benten was ""very fruitful"" as constructive discussion was held on the whole gamut of issues related to the pilgrimage, transport and accommodation facilities for pilgrims and their safety.

We like roti, dal and kadhi, so there is a change,? he regretted.Reluctant to leave anything to chance before the August 8 vote which has senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel vying for one of the three Rajya Sabha seats from Gujarat, the party leadership has decided to arrange for a Gujarati chef for the legislators? culinary comfort.DK Shivakumar, the power minister in Karnataka?s Congress government, said a Gujarati chef will be made available for the MLAs soon. ?Some have even expressed the desire to cook and asked the resort for permission, which has been granted,? he added. A nostalgic Shaikh said a typical breakfast back home in Gujarat consisted of ?bhakhri? and ?thepla?. Lunch normally consisted of dal, roti and a dry vegetable dish.However, breakfast at ?Eagleton - The Golf Village?, some 40km outside the state capital Bengaluru, typically comprised idli and dosa while the menu for lunch mostly included rice or ragi balls.?In Gujarat, we are not used to consuming much rice. We prefer roti,? Shaikh explained.The Congress legislators were flown to Bengaluru late on Friday after six of their colleagues quit the party, depleting its numerical strength in the Gujarat assembly to 51.At least half-a-dozen of the remaining legislators are reportedly loyalists of Shankersinh Vaghela, a former chief minister recently expelled from the party. Patel needs the support of 45 MLAs to be re-elected and the Congress is doing everything it can to keep its flock together.On Saturday, the Congress moved the chief election commissioner, accusing the BJP government of Gujarat of using ?money, muscle power and government machinery? to engineer defections. The BJP has denied all the charges.",general,2136,55,70
Congress-led UPA made economy strong: President Mukherjee,"President Pranab Mukherjee may have just served a reminder to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the economic growth rate. He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being very observant.Delivering the special address at the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, President Mukherjee said, ""Four of the five years during the UPA-I the growth rate was more than 8 per cent. The base of Indian economy was so strong that it sustained 2008 global economic crisis.""He said that rate of investment was about 38 per cent of the GDP with sound rate of savings.Mukherjee emphasised that the various governments (led by Congress party) worked hard to streamline and strengthen the fundamentals of Indian economy.'INDIA WAS ASSERTIVE EARLIER ALSO'President Mukherjee seems to have served another reminder to PM Modi by referring to 'aggression' shown by Indira Gandhi during 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.""That was the highpoint of assertion and aggression. If that was not aggression, then what is aggression of Indian nation,"" Mukherjee asked.Indira Gandhi expressed India's concerns through 1971 assertion, Mukherjee underscored, adding that it was India's strong response that Pakistan was forced to declare unilateral ceasefire.PM Modi has been talking about surgical strike as the first real assertion by Indian state against the rogue behaviour of Pakistan.President Mukherjee reminded the nation of the contributions of first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for laying the foundation of democracy in India.MUKHERJEE PRAISED MODIShowering lavish praise on Narendra Modi, Mukherjee said that he has acquired mastery over external affairs, foreign economy.""He is observant. I appreciate when he said that you can win election by majority but to rule you need consensus,"" Mukherjee said about Modi.He related a story about Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he requested Pranab Mukherjee not to be very harsh on the then George Fernandes, who was being attacked in Parliament over coffin scandal after Kargil war.Mukherjee served under four Prime Ministers as ministers beginning with Indira Gandhi and followed by Rajiv Gandhi, Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh.DISRUPTION IN PARLIAMENTPresident Mukherjee expressed concerns over continued disruption in Parliament.""Enormous power is vested in members elected to Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. Their primary job to make laws,"" Mukherjee said.Talking about Anna Hazare's anti-graft movement, he said that agitation was a message that the Lok Sabha had failed in doing its primary duty of framing an anti-corruption law, a Lokpal law despite several committees recommending for it.""In the first Lok Sabha during 1952-57, total 677 sittings of Parliament were held and 319 bills passed. But, in contrast the 15th Lok Sabha saw only 357 sittings and only 180 bills were passed because the disease of disruption has crept in,"" Mukherjee said.""Disruption in Parliament and law making is unacceptable to me,"" President asserted adding, ""In 15th Lok Sabha, as much as 46.1 per cent of allotted time was lost to disruption.""A visibly upset President said Session after session lapsed without passing a law. Who will make law then, he asked. CAG report is presented to the Lok Sabha. Who will examine it, he wondered.The first annual Budget of India was of Rs 397 crore only while the today India's Budget stands at Rs 17 lakh crore, Mukherjee said.",general,3402,57,70
46% of 3.2 crore pending court cases against government,"At a time when the country's courts and justice ministry are battling a backlog of more than 3.2 crore cases, it turns out that the government - both Centre and states - is the biggest single litigant, being a party in a whopping 46 per cent of them. According to statistics provided by the law and justice ministry, the central government alone is involved in 1,35,060 lawsuits across the country. Experts say India has far too few courts, judges and prosecutors for its 1.3 billion people. Bulk of the cases is pending in subordinate courts thronged by poor litigants who bear the brunt of the creeping system. RAILWAY HAS MOST PENDING CASESThe ministry of railways is the biggest contributor, being a party in 66,685 pending lawsuits of which 10,464 are more than a decade old. Five other ministries with the most number of cases are finance (15,651), communications (12,642), home affairs (11,668), defence (3,433) and health & family welfare (3,275). Listing the Narendra Modi government's achievements in the arena of justice delivery in the last three years, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said a key goal is to reduce government litigation as a result of which the overall case pileup is set to witness a sharp dip. ""A draft national litigation policy is under formulation to make the government a responsible and efficient litigant. I wrote to all governmental departments and ministries to take pro-active measures to settle cases were government is a party,"" said Prasad. Ministry sources said to give an impetus to the goal, a nodal officer has been appointed in each department to keep a track of disputes in which the department is involved, avoid filing appeals except in cases that involve a substantial policy matter, and withdrawal of vexatious litigation.SETTLEMENT ON THE CARDSThe ministry is also making efforts to ensure cases involving two government wings or PSUs are settled out of the court using alternate dispute redress mechanisms. Pendency in the Supreme Court is now at 60,750 cases. About 40 lakh cases are stuck in high courts. The pendency in district and subordinate courts is at 2.74 crore. The department of justice's ""Action Plan To Reduce Government Litigation"" says, ""Government is regarded to be the biggest contributor to litigation in India. Approximately 46 per cent of the total pending cases in courts pertains to the government. This includes cases relating to Public Sector Undertakings and other autonomous bodies. Government litigation includes service matters, disputes with private entities as well as inter-se disputes between two government departments and disputes between two PSUs."" The Legal Information Management and Briefing System (LIMBS) - an endeavour to bring court cases against the government on a single comprehensive online platform - was launched last year. It was an effort to ensure that various ministries do not adopt conflicting stands on the same issue before a court, a growing trend these days, and to make maximum efforts to settle disputes between governments and among public sector units out of the court, which will reduce the backlog to a large extent. Prasad said LIMBS has captured details of more than 1,30,231 cases in which the government is involved. ""It helps to introduce transparency as well as a sense of ownership among various stakeholders/ministries/departments during the entire cycle of a court case,"" he said. The progress of each case - what happened on a particular date, stand adopted by the government, etc - will be available at the click of a button for the official who has registered himself with the LIMBS. Several recent chief justices had been asking the Centre to take immediate steps to ensure that only minimal litigation between government departments and PSUs reach the court. They have also been calling for out-of-court-settlement of disputes to reduce the pileup.",politics,3883,55,70

"NGT orders ?10,000 fine for throwing waste at public places","Throwing garbage in the open will attract a fine R10,000, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) announced on Monday. The tribunal said municipal solid waste is one of the most serious pollutants in the country, especially in Delhi.According to the NGT, all authorities are under ?statutory? obligation to ensure that waste is ?collected, transported and disposed? of in accordance with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 so that it does not cause public health hazards.?All major sources of municipal solid waste generation - hotels, restaurants, slaughter houses, vegetable markets etc, should be directed to provide segregated waste and handover the same to the corporation in accordance with rules.Read More:East Delhi civic body proposes charge for clearing garbage?Any such body, person, hotels, residents, slaughter houses, vegetable markets which does not comply with the directions or throw their waste in any drain or at any public place shall be liable to pay environmental compensation at the rate of R10,000 per default,? a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar said.The archaic and futile anti-littering law of 2009 had a provision of fine of R50 to R500. In June, the state government asked the municipal corporations to change the bylaws, so that they are in accordance with the Union government?s Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The fresh provisions recommended fines ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 for throwing garbage and littering in public space.The tribunal noted that the national capital generates 9,600 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste per day and there is no ?clear map? ready with the municipal bodies to deal with this huge quantity of waste.It also directed commissioners of the three civic bodies to submit a scheme within a month before the tribunal for providing incentive to the people who give segregated waste at source, ?by way of rebate in property tax and on other hand to impose penalties on residents, societies, RWAs who do not provide segregated waste?.?It should be kept in mind that as per polluter pays principle, each person would be liable to pay for causing pollution, if the waste is generated.

The fatally poisonous Blowfish is a delicacy in Japan,"Trust the Japanese to do something the rest of the world can't even fathom, and ace it!For starters, the fish dish in question is called Fugu in Japan, or pufferfish, as the rest of the world knows it. Though it comes in various varieties, we most commonly know this fish as 'blowfish'--yes, the one that inflates at the prospect of any threat.First things first, this is what the pufferfish looks like:Okay, that's not a pretty picture. And that's not even an adult pufferfish. Let's just save you the gory details and get to the point. Here's what you REALLY need to know about this Japanese delicacy:1. It takes a chef three to ten years in training to be able to cut the fish right so it doesn't remain poisonous for the consumer. 2. Restaurant preparation of Fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries.3. Accidental poisoning by Fugu can lead to death within 10 minutes.4. Fugu contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin in its inner organs, especially the liver, ovaries, and the eyes; the skin is usually non-poisonous.5. The poison in Fugu paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious. The poisoned victim is not able to breathe, and eventually dies from asphyxiation.6.

Pakistan to fence whole border with Afghanistan,"Despite Afghanistan's strong reservations, Pakistan has started the fencing work along the whole Pakistan-Afghanistan border or Durand Line.

The 27-year-old former rickshaw driver is one of only four people in the world to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic condition dubbed ?tree-man disease? that left him unable to hold his three-year-old daughter. ?Bajandar?s cure was a remarkable milestone in the history of medical science,? said Samanta Lal Sen, plastic surgery coordinator at Dhaka Medical College hospital. ?We operated on him at least 16 times to remove the warts. The hands and feet are now almost fine. He will be discharged within the next 30 days after a couple of minor surgeries to perfect the shape of his hands,? Sen said.

Speaking from his bed at the hospital, which has been treating him free of charge, Bajandar said the pain of his condition had been unbearable. ?I never thought I would ever be able to hold my kid with my hands,? he said, showing a bandaged hand. ?Now I feel so much better.

Now he plans to set up a small business using donations received from well-wishers across the world. ?I was so worried about raising my daughter,? he said. ?I hope the curse won?t return again.?",world,2453,57,70

The officer added that it would be incorrect to say there is no evidence against accused in the case.Top sources in the Delhi police's special cell, which is investigating the matter, have revealed they sent as many as 40 video samples of the controversial JNU event for forensic examinationMost of the footage, they said, have been found to be authentic.Also read: If Afzal Guru is terrorist, so is Godse: Kanhaiya KumarUMAR KHALID MAY HAVE RAISED ANTI-INDIA CRIESAnti-India sloganeering did ring through the JNU campus that day, but Kumar's voice has tested negative in the forensic tests, highly-placed special-cell sources revealed.Kumar, the investigators said, had reached the scene after a clash broke out between JNU students and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists.But lab examinations have identified nine students as possible slogan-shouters, including Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, special-cell sources said.Most of the other slogan shouters were Kashmiri students from several universities, Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University included, according to special-cell officials.But no FIR has since been lodged against the Kashmiri suspects, they said.Also read: Ramjas violence: Campus politics turning colleges into battlegrounds, hurting academic freedom?KANHAIYA: HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED MY INNOCENCEIndia Today spoke to Kanhaiya Kumar, who said he has not seen this report, but added that he has always maintained that he has been wrongly implicated.

Panel seeks probe into Kingfisher dues worth ?295 crore,"New Delhi, Mar 17 (PTI) A parliamentary panel today sought a probe into defunct Kingfisher Airlines allowed to accumulate high levels of dues to state-owned AAI, which was in ""violation of all existing rules"". Bogged down by financial woes, Kingfisher Airlines was closed down in 2012. The carrier was promoted by businessman Vijay Mallya, who is wanted by Indian authorities for loan default and other cases. At the end of December 2016, the airline owed dues worth Rs 294.69 crore to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the amount has been written off. The national airports operator has also filed a legal suit against the carrier to recover the dues. Pulling up the AAI, the panel said it allowed the accumulation of dues to such a high level in violation of all the existing rules and procedures in practice. Besides, the committee has recommended that AAI may conduct an internal inquiry to ""fix the responsibility of AAI officials for the accumulation of dues by Kingfisher Airlines"". The recommendation has been made by the Department- related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture in its report tabled in Parliament today.

New tech uses glowing bacteria to safely detect landmines,"A team of researchers at an Israeli university has successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that could become a safer system for detecting buried landmines.An estimated 100m landmines are scattered in some 70 countries, a legacy of often long-past conflict, and the devices injure up to 20,000 people a year. Mine clearance work is typically dangerous, labour-intensive and costly.The team at Jerusalem?s Hebrew University has tested mine detection using bacteria genetically modified to give off a fluorescent signal when mines ? often made out plastic ? are close, which can then be detected with a laser.Reporting the findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers say their approach relies on tiny amounts of vapour given off by the explosives in the mines.It was recognised that some plants reacted to those vapours, and the research used modified bacteria that essentially glow in contact with the explosive vapour. Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle ? including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second ? a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkin?s team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour ? similar findings were reported by a team at Edinburgh University in 2009 ? but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.?Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system,? said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment. However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.?For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.?The university said in a statement: ?This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.? A byproduct of the research by Belkin and his team was announced three years ago: the use of modified bacteria to detect pollutants in water, suggesting further applications for the technology.",science,2460,57,70

Having smartphone within reach reduces brain power: Study,"Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) Your brain power may be significantly reduced when your smartphone is within reach - even if it is switched off - affecting your ability to concentrate on a task, scientists have found. Researchers from The University of Texas at Austin in the US conducted experiments with nearly 800 smartphone users to measure, for the first time, how well people can complete tasks when they have their smartphones nearby even when they are not using them. In one experiment, the researchers asked study participants to sit at a computer and take a series of tests that required full concentration in order to score well. The tests were geared to measure participants available cognitive capacity - that is, the brains ability to hold and process data at any given time. Before beginning, participants were randomly instructed to place their smartphones either on the desk face down, in their pocket or personal bag, or in another room. All participants were instructed to turn their phones to silent. The researchers found that participants with their phones in another room significantly outperformed those with their phones on the desk, and they also slightly outperformed those participants who had kept their phones in a pocket or bag. The findings suggest that the mere presence of ones smartphone reduces available cognitive capacity and impairs cognitive functioning, even though people feel they are giving their full attention and focus to the task at hand. ""We see a linear trend that suggests that as the smartphone becomes more noticeable, participants available cognitive capacity decreases,"" said Adrian Ward, Assistant Professor at University of Texas at Austin. ""Your conscious mind isnt thinking about your smartphone, but that process - the process of requiring yourself to not think about something - uses up some of your limited cognitive resources,"" Ward said. In another experiment, researchers looked at how a persons self-reported smartphone dependence - or how strongly a person feels he or she needs to have a smartphone in order to get through a typical day - affected cognitive capacity. Participants performed the same series of computer-based tests as the first group and were randomly assigned to keep their smartphones either in sight on the desk face up, in a pocket or bag, or in another room. In this experiment, some participants were also instructed to turn off their phones. The researchers found that participants who were the most dependent on their smartphones performed worse compared with their less-dependent peers, but only when they kept their smartphones on the desk or in their pocket or bag.",science,2654,57,70

Pawan Sharma, the founder of RAWW, a wildlife conservation NGO shared his feelings on the subject on Facebook and wrote, ""Actress Shruti Ulfat and three others from Nagarjun daily soap booked by Mumbai Range of Thane Territorial wing of the forest department for using Spectacled Cobra, protected species under Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule 2. They were produced in court yesterday and court gave forest department their custody for a day to know and find the people who supplied snake to them. They will be produced in court again today. When I had assisted the Anti Poaching Unit of the Forest Department for primary investigations at the Film City in October last year the actress made us wait for an hour with her rude staff which did not cooperate and all of them had misled the forest department stating that it was VFX /Graphics and not a real snake. However forensic reports in January this year revealed that the snake was real and the responsible people have started facing the heat. Posing for entertainment with a protected species which is one of the top venomous snakes of the country is unethical, illegal and misleading.",general,2255,58,70

You're in good shape: Trump to French Prez's 64-yr-old wife,"US President Donald Trump was captured complimenting the French president?s wife?s appearance Thursday as he toured a famous Paris landmark.Video footage posted on the French government?s official Facebook page showed Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and their wives chatting after their tour of the museums at Les Invalides.As they were saying their good-byes, Trump turned to Brigitte Macron, who is 25 years senior to President Macron, and gestured toward her body.?You know, you?re in such good shape,? Trump said, before repeating the observation to her husband. ?Beautiful,? he added.Brigitte Macron was her husband?s former high school teacher and their relationship has drawn international attention because of their significant age difference.But feminists and President Macron have denounced that attention as sexist, arguing that nobody would blink an eye if he were the older spouse.The Macrons? age difference is identical to that of Donald and Melania Trump, who were spending two days in Paris in celebration of Bastille Day.Trump has drawn criticism in the past for comments some say objectify and demean women, including the infamous ?Access Hollywood? tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women and boasted, ?When you?re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.?It wasn?t the only uncomfortable moment the France first lady shared with US President Trump, however. US president Trump?s official France tour started with an awkward handshake he exchanged with the France first lady.The lengthy and visibly awkward handshake happened when the France first lady, with her husband, welcomed Trump and his wife Melania Trump to Paris.

FIR against ex-Delhi Minister Tomar in fake degree case,"The Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) administration, on Thursday, lodged an FIR at University police station against former Delhi law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar , in a case pertaining to obtaining a fake law degree from the university.The FIR was filed about four months after Tomar?s ?fake? degree was cancelled by the university, after receiving approval of the TMBU?s academic council, syndicate and senate. TMBU proctor Yogendra, who goes by a single name, is the informant in case.?Documentary evidence emerging from the findings of a probe initiated by the TMBU administration, establishing the former minister had committed fraud for procuring a fake degree from university, has been attached with petition submitted to police for lodging the FIR?, he said. Rajesh Tiwary, TMBU?s OSD (legal),said the findings of enquiry related to university papers and residential address submitted by Tomar at the time of his enrolment in law course at Viswanath Singh Institute of legal studies (Munger), which functions under TMBU, had also be referred to in the FIR.The TMBU officials had no clear answer as to why it took the university nearly four months to initiate legal action against former minister after his degree was cancelled. In March this year, the TMBU senate had, by a unanimous voice vote, approved the cancellation of the law degree of Tomar, which was earlier found to be ?fake? in an inquiry held by the university in 2016.The finding was conveyed to a Delhi court hearing a case in connection with Tomar?s degree, through an affidavit filed on behalf of TMBU. Subsequently, the process for cancelling the ?tainted? degree had been initiated by the TMBU authorities.The senate approval has paved way for the issuance of a formal notification by university for cancellation of his degree, which had allegedly been issued with the connivance of some employees of the university.Earlier, the examination board and disciplinary committee of the university had given their consent for cancellation of Tomar?s law degree. Even the Delhi police, in its inquiry conducted separately, had found that Tomar?s law degree was fake.Tomar was arrested by the Delhi police on June 9, 2015 in connection with the fake degree case. He had submitted his resignation to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the following day, just hours after a Delhi court remanded him to four-day police custody.More than a dozen university employees, who had been indicted in the probe undertaken by university and also in Delhi police probe, for their complicity in issuing a fake degree to the former Delhi minister have, however, been spared legal action, for now.TMBU?registrar Mohan Mishra said hearing in the fake degree case was underway in the Delhi high court and the employees indicted in university probe had been also indicted in probe of Delhi Police. ?The TMBU decided to defer initiation of separate legal action against them till the decision of court on employees is known?, he explained.",general,3005,55,70

DU to include GST in curriculum of commerce programmes,"Students in Delhi University will now have to wraps their heads around the historic goods and services tax (GST) that has flustered many across the country since its unveiling on July 1. GST, hailed as the country's biggest tax reform since Independence, replaced a thicket of federal and state levies while transforming Asia's third-largest economy into a single market. In a meeting this week, the varsity's academic council approved the inclusion of GST in the curriculum of commerce programmes such as B Com (Hons), B Com (Prog) and BA (Prog).It has also recommended this to the university's executive council.The move aims to help commerce students comprehend the newly introduced tax reform. The ""one nation one tax"" section will be taught from this academic session as the council wants changes in the course contents of B Com (Hons) in accordance with recent developments on GST.TOP COLLEGES IN AGREEMENTThe attempt has also brought the top colleges in agreement. ""So far, goods and services tax was not included in the curriculum. Going by the status quo, it is important that students understand the tax well. We are awaiting a formal notification from the university and will include it in the curriculum for this academic year,"" said Reena Chadha, professor at Shri Ram College of Commerce. The university is the first in line to include the tax in the curriculum as Rajesh Jha, professor at Rajdhani College and an academic council member, pointed out that the executive is most likely to sanction the inclusion.Experts say GST should help widen the country's tiny tax base, free up internal trade, make it easier to do business and reduce the clout middlemen wield at state borders. Governments had been trying to introduce the reform for at least 10 years, but had failed to get the support of Parliament. The tax will be taught to students in B Com (Hons) in third and fifth semesters while B Com (Prog) students of fifth and sixth semester will have a paper on GST and Customs law. If approved by the executive council, it will also be taught to BA (Prog) students in the third and fourth semester. In a meeting concluded last week, the academic council accepted the recommendations made by the faculty of commerce and business.WHAT THE STUDENTS WILL BE TAUGHTStudents will be taught the constitutional framework of indirect taxes before GST, which include taxation powers of union and state governments, the concept of VAT, rationale and structure of GST, GST council, GST network, state compensation mechanism and registration, etc. The curriculum is also expected to include levy and collection of GST, which will cover taxable events like supply of goods and services, places of supply like within state, interstate, import and export, time of supply, valuation rules, taxability of reimbursement of expenses, and exemption from GST.""Tax has now been simplified for our country with GST. Revenue generated from GST will be generated in a manner that will benefit India. Economists are already expecting the tax revenue to reach 2 trillion from 1 billion so students should be apprised with the times they will have to work in,"" said Dr Bhibhu Pratap Sahu, an assistant professor at Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Khalsa College.Students will be taught shortcomings of pre-GST indirect taxes.Also Read:Foreign languages remain hot favourite among DU aspirants",general,3369,54,70

""President Trump has consistently made misleading claims, attacked the judiciary and threatened sovereign states, the press and public,"" he continued. He further said how todays outburst ""is broadcasting to foreign leaders his continuing impulsiveness, recklessness, delusion and ignorance about government."" Adding, ""That makes Trumps tweets a national security threat. It emboldens our enemies to take advantage of his flagrant shortcomings.""

Mumbai colleges may reserve seats for those who live nearby,"After demands by legislators, the state government is considering reserving seats in colleges for students who live close to them.Saying that junior college students were forced to travel longer distances despite having many colleges near their homes, legislators from all parties on Thursday demanded that a few seats be reserved in colleges for students living in the vicinity. The state education department said it will hold a meeting with elected representatives and stakeholders to consider admitting students in colleges near their homes and request the Bombay high court to amend the existing rules.Legislators said since online admissions were based on the marks student secure, students from Colaba and Fort are made to travel as far as Borivli or Ghatkopar and students in Ghatkopar get admission in Goregaon colleges. Colaba?s BJP MLA Raj Purohit said it was unfair for students living in south Mumbai, which has the most colleges, as they are forced to travel to suburban colleges because of their marks. Congress? Aslam Shaikh and Shiv Sena?s Sunil Prabhu supported Purohit and said a certain amount of seats should be reserved for students living nearby. Education minister Vinod Tawde said the department would convene a meeting of all stakeholders and legislators to discuss the issue. ?Admission norms are based on merit and the marks obtained by students. The procedure we follow has been approved by the Bombay high court. We are positive about changing the norms to allow students to bag seats in colleges near them,? he said. BJP?s Sunil Deshmukh, however, opposed the demand and said admissions should be granted based on merit and that would be unjust for high-scorers as they could be denied admission to good colleges. While updating legislators about this year?s junior college admissions, Tawde said, ?About 2.68 lakh students in Mumbai have sought admissions in FYJC and the government has made arrangements for 15,000 more seats. The students faced difficulties after the website crashed. About 10,000 students changed their minds after filing the forms and figuring in the first list. This too inconvenienced other students.? He added, ?When we conducted a survey to study the reasons behind students? such decisions, we found that students were in two minds about admissions owing to the absence of counselling.?",general,2345,59,70
CBSE may postpone Class 12 board exams by a week: Report,"The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is planning to postpone Class 12 board exams to March second week owing to the upcoming assembly polls in five states, sources said.

It is most likely the exams will start on March 9 or 10. But a final view is yet to be taken,? said a source.The exams usually begin on March 1 and end in April, and results are declared in the third week of May. The postponement will help conduct exams smoothly as teachers and staff will be busy with election duty, sources said. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur will go to polls between February 11 and March 8.There will no problem if results are declared on time, school principals and teachers said. ?I don?t think 8-9 days? delay in starting the examination will affect anything. There has been a lot of digitisation in CBSE. Last year too, CBSE was 10 days ahead in declaring the result,? said principal of a school in west Delhi, requesting anonymity.

Thailand to check monks' bad habits with smart ID cards,"Thailand?s Buddhist monks could soon be issued ?smart ID cards? flagging any drug or criminal records, in the latest move by the junta to restore the tarnished image of the men in orange robes.The kingdom has around 300,000 monks, who are held in high regard as keepers of the national religion. But in recent months the clergy has been plagued by a series of high-profile scandals ranging from sex and drugs to murders taking place at temples.The junta, which took power in 2014, wants to reorganise Thai Buddhism, with misbehaving monks first in their crosshairs.?Monks across the country already hold the paper-based cards but the information is out-of-date, which makes it hard to verify their background,? Ormsin Chivapruck, an official at the Office of the Prime Minister, told reporters on Thursday.Digitalised smart cards would enable up-to-date tracking with the monk?s monastic history recorded alongside any criminal offence or report of drug use, he added. The move is ?to prevent fake monks using religion, or suspected wrong-doers from hiding their illegal acts behind orange robes,? he added.Details will be discussed next week at a meeting of the Supreme Sangha Council, the body governing the national faith.But rollout of smart cards may be complicated as all Thai men are expected by social convention to ordain for at least a few weeks.Critics say the rigid hierarchy of the Supreme Sangha Council makes it unable to counter corruption or embrace change.The government has already forced more than 46,000 temples to submit their financial accounts, amid claims of widespread irregularities.The most famous monk scandal played out earlier this year as troops searched the temple of the mega-rich Dhammakaya sect on the outskirts of Bangkok, to arrest the controversial former abbot who is accused of money-laundering.

'Doomsday' vault flooded after surrounding soil melts,"It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world?s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity?s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide ?failsafe? protection against ?the challenge of natural or man-made disasters?.But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the world?s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. ?It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,? said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.?A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,? she told the Guardian. Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18C.But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. ?It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,? Aschim said. ?We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.?The vault?s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. The end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7C above normal on Spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point.?The question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?? said Aschim. The Svalbard archipelago, of which Spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to Ketil Isaksen, from Norway?s Meteorological Institute. ?The Arctic and especially Svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. The climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,? Isaksen told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.The vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. They have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood.Aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: ?We have to find solutions. It is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. We are doing this for the world.??This is supposed to last for eternity,? said Åsmund Asdal at the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, which operates the seed vault.",science,3191,53,70

Anna Hazare to launch public protest if RTI Act amended,"Ahmednagar (Maha), Apr 13 (PTI) Amid reports that the Centre is planning to amend the RTI Act, social activist Anna Hazare has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him not to do so as it would dilute its provisions and would be an ""injustice"" to common people. ""The central government is mulling to bring changes in the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has given information about it on its website,"" Hazare said in the letter made public today. ""It is the fundamental right of the people to know how their money is being spent and what kind of work the government is doing. Bringing changes in the RTI Act, which people have got after years of agitations, is like damaging their fundamental right. We feel that it is an attempt to weaken this historic law,"" he said. The government has proposed a new set of rules for processing Right to Information applications, complaints and appeals and has sought suggestions from the public by April 15. The proposed rules, aimed at replacing RTI rules of 2012, have been placed by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on its website for comments from public. Hazare said he was opposed to the proposed change in allowing withdrawal of appeal to the CIC. If this is allowed, there can a situation where the applicant would be pressurised to withdraw his appeal, he said. The anti-corruption crusader said he was also against the proposal to terminate the appeal proceedings upon the death of the applicant. Pointing out that there have been 56 cases of murder of RTI applicant in the last year, Hazare said the proposed change will make the things more dangerous. Hazare also opposed the proposed limit of 500 words for an RTI application saying that it would be unjust for common people.",general,1798,55,70

""Nobody in India has the capacity to take on Modi ji,"" he said. After the sudden break-up with Lalu Prasad's RJD over corruption allegations last week, Nitish aligned again with the BJP and formed a coalition government on July 27.

Gadkari seeks facilities for those detained during Emergency,"Union minister for transport and shipping Nitin Gadkari has demanded that the Maharashtra government provide special facilities to those detained during the Emergency under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).

The group, led by the Sangh?s vice-president Sacchidanand Upasane, national secretary Komal Chheda and Maharashtra unit chief Jayprakash Pande insisted that the detainees be treated as freedom fighters and be given all facilities available to a freedom fighter in the country. Incidentally, most of the MISA detainees are RSS activists or its supporters.The group submitted a memorandum to Gadkari, briefing him about the facilities and recognition extended to detainees in states like UP, MP, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. They claimed that in these states, the detainees are considered at par with the freedom fighters and given pensions and other facilities. The government in Rajasthan recently formed a committee to study facilities available to MISA and Defence of India Rules 1971 detainees in other states.

"UP CM rejects 'Metro Man's' resignation, gives 3 projects","Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has put Metro Man E Sreedharan back on track. The priest-turned-politician's pro-development push is set to see the train system chug into six cities of the state even before their population eligibility make the cut. Sreedharan delivered his home project, Kochi Metro, last month. On turning 85, he planned to ""hang his boots"", and met the UP CM to convey his decision of retiring from his advisory role to the state government. ""The UP CM not only did not allow me to tender my resignation but added the responsibility of planning metros for three more cities. He is very keen on getting the metro to his own constituency, Gorakhpur,"" Sreedharan said in Kochi on Thursday.While the first phase of metro will be commissioned for commercial operations in state capital Lucknow any time now, the home turfs of Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be gifted a metro rail much before they make it to the merit list. ""While the phase I project, a 10.5-km line for Lucknow is ready for inspection by the Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety and will be thrown open to the public once it gets a nod, detailed project reports for Varanasi have already been made,"" said Sreedharan. ""The UP CM now wants metros in Agra and Meerut too, along with Kanpur. For Meerut, there are already plans of linking it with the Rapid Rail.""MORE BUSINESSA boom in the development of mass transit metro projects in India is not only helping free up choked roads, but is also generating business opportunities as the country ploughs funds into updating its creaky public transport system. Adityanath's metro push, however, has to circumvent a wall of heritage structures in UP's temple towns. The plan for Varanasi proposed by Sreedharan met with the CM's disapproval as it went precariously close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.""We are now going to redesign the plan and are working on a light metro project for the city that will cost less, reduce noise and vibrations,"" Sreedharan added.Metro projects are usually commissioned for cities with a population of over two million (20 lakh) residents whereas light metro, which is yet to be implemented in any Indian city so far, is proposed for those with population between one and two million. State governments, however, can plan or propose a metro system in advance, looking at a city's long-term transportation requirements, tourism indices and a comprehensive mobility plan is drafted to study the feasibility of the project.Comparing the construction of metro rail with China, Sreedharan pointed out, ""While China builds 300 km of metro rail per year, India lags far behind with only 22 km a year.""As the dust settles following rumours of his running for the post of President, Sreedharan insists he was never spoken to about a possible nomination. ""It was entirely kite-flying by the media. No one from the government spoke to me about it. In fact even if someone did, I would have turned it down. I am 85. Do you think I will survive another five years?"" he laughed.As the Delhi Metro grapples with unprecedented delays in line openings and commuter rush, Sreedharan, who introduced the transport system to the city, said, ""Ever since I retired from Delhi Metro, I ensured that even my shadow does not hover around the place. The new MD and team are very competent. The challenges today are very different but they have worked very well.""Also WATCH:",general,3435,57,70

The military said the missile had features such as ""underwater controlled propulsion and advanced guidance and navigation"".Last year, Pakistan said it was ""seriously concerned"" by India's test of anti-ballistic missiles which media reports said could intercept incoming nuclear weapons.

There are sections of general trade in some parts of the country, which are limping back to normalcy,? he said.The company?s topline and volume growth were impacted by 200 basis points with the canteen store department not buying from it.?I think the most affected still remains the wholesale in the territory of central India like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, those are the cases where the traders are still sitting on the fence, waiting to understand what they need to do and how they need to react to the new era of GST,? he said.?I would believe that sooner or later, the trade channel should start unclogging and there would be some element of channel reset but the large number of wholesalers who are engaged in trade, would have to find ways and means of engaging with the trade, accepting GST is a reality and they will have to live with that,? he added.",business,1836,52,70
"Man, wife assaulted for stopping mob from beating cattle","A software engineer, Kanan, along with his wife and her two friends were brutally assaulted by a mob of armed meat mafia goons on Friday evening. ""It was about 4pm on Friday when all four of us were sightseeing in village Khedapoda, Chandili when we saw some gangster like men armed with sticks and knives, severely beating cattle,"" said Kanan, who took videos and clicked pictures of the distressed animals before dialling the #100 number for police and senior officials of the locality including SP Rahul. The police, however, did not come to the site. ""With no response from the police and SP Rahul, we tried reasoning with the goons ourselves. Little did we know, that they would attack us with the same sticks and axes with which they were beating the animals. I was attacked while my wife was molested by these barbarians. They snatched and smashed my phone which had all recordings. It's a miracle we are still alive. Seeing the lawlessness here, would not like to come back to Odisha,"" Kanan, elaborated further. Kanan is undergoing treatment. A case has been filed in Chandili Police Station, but no arrests have been made for the assault and no cattle have been seized till now.SP Rahul evaded India Today's calls and was not available for a comment.Sources revealed that 1000's of cattle are smuggled for slaughter on foot from Odisha to Andhra Pradesh through the vast rainforest cover in Odisha on a weekly basis. This is the same belt where Kanan and his wife and friends were attacked. This is not the first case of growing lawlessness in Odisha, where criminals are at large and police is missing in action. RECENT CASES OF ATTACKS- Earlier this week, in Odisha's Raigada district, animal activists informed police of several hundred cattle being smuggled on foot through the Chandili rainforest area in the middle of the night (with photographs and videos for proof). On arriving at the spot, the police official from Chandili Police was seen ushering cattle smugglers to hide the animals and no case was filed on the grounds that no cattle were found. India Today has access to photographs and videos to prove that cattle were indeed being taken on foot and audio recordings of police officials saying that no cattle were found on the spot. - Recently, animal lovers Teertho and Niranjan, were pelted with stones and beaten with sticks by meat mafia goons for visiting and clicking photographs at an animal fair, in Kaalapatthar, Beguniya district of Odisha. Niranjan was wounded on the head while Teertho was severely attacked and his wallet, phone and passport were stolen. - Shifting focus to Karanataka, Thimaraju, an AWBI officer, was thrashed by a mob of meat mafia goons last month, in the presence of police officials, for bringing to light the workings of an illegal slaughter house in Channarayapatna, Hassan district. ""I went for a visit with police officials to the illegal slaughterhouse where we found hoards of calves locked inside a small room. On releasing the animals, we were returning towards the PCR van when I heard a mob of butchers chasing me and surprisingly no police officer was there in sight for my protection. I was hit on the head and thrashed in front of the Police PCR van. The police had conveniently vanished for those few minutes."" This is a brief list of recent cases of attacks by meat mafia goons on tourists, animal lovers, AWBI officers and genuine gau rakshaks. In the above cases, even when police was informed of illegalities in their jurisdiction, no action was taken indicating a strong nexus between the police and the rampant meat-mafia in India which does not spare women or tourists.ALSO READ:Cow vigilantes or extortionists?

"Woman kills husband, sleeps next to his body for two nights","A woman in southwest Delhi?s Kapashera planned the perfect murder of her ?abusive? husband and almost got away with it too, but for the sharp eye of a police informer who spotted injuries on the body minutes before it was cremated.The woman, Shilpi Adhikari, 32, police said, killed her husband but did not know what to do with the body after the murder.She slept beside it for two nights inside her one-room house in Kapashera. On the third day, she informed her neighbours and tried to pass the incident off as natural death. She almost managed to get away with it too but for a police informer, who noticed strangulation marks on the man?s neck minutes before the body was to be cremated and informed the police. The police on Tuesday arrested Shilpi and registered a case of murder. Shilpi Adhikari, a native of West Bengal, worked as a housekeeping employee at the Royal Bank of Scotland. She waited for the weekend to execute her plan, when her husband Nitish usually drank heavily and thrashed her. It had to be done on a Saturday. She had waited the whole week. According to investigating officials, on Saturday evening after dinner, she offered Nitish alcohol. She had bought extra alcohol for her husband from a local shop near her house. ?She told her husband that it was her treat and continued giving him alcohol till late in the night,? an investigating officer said. Read: ?He beat me for hours?: Delhi woman who smothered husband says he left no choice?At around midnight, when her husband passed out she strangulated him. Unsure about what to do next, she continued to sleep in the same 8x10 feet room with the body,? the officer said. For more than 48 hours, Shilpi did not step out. On Monday morning, at around 9 am, locals in the Kapashera village heard Shilpi crying outside her house. She was wailing loudly, a villagers later told the police. She told locals that her husband had suffered a heart attack and died in his sleep. Nobody suspected her. The couple had two kids, aged 13 and 11, who live with their maternal grandmother in West Bengal. According to police, the locals, mostly migrants from West Bengal and Bihar, advised that the body be cremated as it had started smelling because of the heat on Monday as the day temperature was around 37°C. By noon, the locals reached the crematorium along with the body. Shilpi was there too. An officer said Nitish?s body was on a pyre, when a police informer noticed some marks on Nitish?s body and also realised that the smell emanating from the body wasn?t normal. He secretly called inspector Ashish Dalal, posted at the Kapashera police station. Dalal and his team immediately rushed to the crematorium and stopped the locals from cremating the body. ?Had we been 10-15 minutes late, the body would have reduced to ashes. There would be no evidence and it would have been a perfect murder. We took the body and sent it for post mortem,? an officer told the Hindustan Times.Doctors told the police on Tuesday morning that the man had died of strangulation more than 72 hours before the body was brought for post mortem. Shilpi, who was detained from the spot, was formally arrested. Nitish, according to Shilpi?s confession was an abusive drinker who thrashed her mercilessly. The beatings, like his drinking, had increased over the last few months leaving her with no option but to murder him.",general,3373,59,70

UIDAI is the nodal body responsible for rolling out Aadhaar, the 12-digit unique identification number that identifies residents based on biometrics. The authority swung into action after it received certain complaints about some of these operators charging money for enrolments -- a service that is free of charge. Some other instances relate to overcharging for updation of Aadhaar details, for which UIDAI has prescribed a rate of Rs 25, while some pertained to operators departing from the set procedures.

Maha law colleges allowed to revise fees after 9 years,"Private law colleges in Maharashtra have been allowed to hike their fees for the first time in nine years.Fees for both three-year and five-year LLB courses are being revised by the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA). Some colleges have been allowed to double or even triple the current fees, while in some cases the fees has been reduced.Till now, the fees at law colleges in the state was being regulated by their respective universities. Many universities including the University of Mumbai (MU) have not changed the fee structure of their affiliated colleges for a long time. MU had last revised the fees in 2008, when it prescribed annual fees in the range of Rs12,000 to Rs13,500 for both three-year and five-year LLB courses. However, after the state categorised law programmes as ?professional courses?, they were brought under the FRA?s ambit, making them eligible for fee revision.?The law colleges were brought under the FRA?s control, as the universities don?t have a mechanism to monitor the finances of individual colleges. We have decided to fix the fees of most of the colleges in the range of Rs15,000 to Rs20,000. But the colleges that are offering better infrastructure and good teachers have been permitted to charge even more. We have gone through the audited reports of colleges? expenditure. They are not supposed to profiteer off students? fees,? said a member of FRA.Some colleges had hiked fees without waiting for a nod from the university. In October 2015, HT had reported that the university had directed a law college in Goregaon to refund excess fee charged from students.The regulator has now fixed the fees of academic year 2016-17, which will be applicable retroactively, as well as fees for 2017-18, which will be applicable for the upcoming academic year. Colleges have welcomed the long-due revision in fees. ?All these years, we were running in huge deficit. Most of the colleges rely on part-time teachers, but we had appointed full time teachers,? said Jyoti Deshmukh, principal, VES College of Law, Chembur.The students, however, feel that the colleges need to upgrade their infrastructure and quality of education in order to justify the hike. ?Many colleges don?t have basic facilities such as library and moot court room.

Mehbooba Mufti claims Chinese interference in J&K unrest,"Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday accused China of meddling in the troubled state that has recently witnessed a spike in violence. The chief minister was speaking to reporters emerging from a meeting with Union home minister Rajnath Singh with whom she discussed the security situation in the state. She said the present crisis in Kashmir is not a mere law-and-order problem, adding the fight is against foreign powers. Earlier it was Pakistan but now there are reports of China meddling in the Kashmir affairs, she said. ?We cannot fight this war alone. We need backing of the whole country and all political parties to emerge victorious,? Mehbooba said.Mufti has earlier blamed Pakistan for the unrest in the state, but this is for the first time she pointed the finger at China. The allegation comes amid a standoff between Indian and Chinese forces in Doklam at the Sikkim border. Militants have stepped up attacks in recent months on government forces in the state as counter-insurgency operations intensify. Mufti?s meeting with the home minister in the national capital in the wake of the attack on Amarnath pilgrims on July 10, in which seven persons died, lasted for almost an hour after it commenced at 11.30am. She termed the attack a conspiracy to whip up communal tension in the state?Ensuring security of Amarnath Yatra obviously topped the agenda of the meeting,? said an aide to the home minister. Their meeting also came a day after the home minister briefed top opposition leaders on the situation in the valley and steps taken to ensure better security for the Amarnath pilgrims. The opposition has slammed the government for failing to ensure security of Amarnath Yatris. The home ministry in consultation with the state government has decided to erect 21 more security pickets on the Amarnath route to check whether any vehicle carrying pilgrims is moving beyond the deadline of 7pm in the Valley. The ill-fated bus that came under attack in the state?s Anantnag district had violated the deadline.",general,2053,56,70

(Dharamsala Test, Day 2: Key highlights)One had expected that Rahane would improve his stats at home in the marathon season which will end after the ongoing fourth Test against Australia in Dharamsala.

Police arrests prime accused in Delhi's Jamia Nagar rape,"Two weeks after a 15-year-old girl accused a 35-year-old builder and his four friends of allegedly raping and blackmailing her over a period of four months in south Delhi?s Jamia Nagar, the police on Saturday arrested the builder from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. The other four men are still at large. The arrest of Sajid Khan came hours after the girl?s mother was shot at allegedly by two unidentified bike-borne men, some distance away from her home in Jamia Nagar. The police are probing Sajid?s role in the firing, though they believe that he was not present at the spot when the woman was shot at. The 47-year-old woman was on her way to a local hospital with her daughter at the time of the crime. Two bullets were fired on them. One of the rounds brushed against the woman?s hip. She was admitted to AIIMS and is undergoing treatment, said police. Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal visited the woman at AIIMS on Friday and said the women?s panel will set up a committee to look into the incident. RP Upadhyay, joint commissioner of police (southeastern range), said that Sajid was the main accused in the gang rape case and was absconding since the FIR was registered. ?Our teams were working on the case and collecting information about the suspects after the FIR was registered. Six raids were made over the past two weeks to nab them,? said Upadhyay.On Friday, DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya said, the investigating team received inputs about Sajid?s movements in Bijnor. A team was immediately dispatched. ?Raids were conducted at his possible hideouts and he was finally caught in the evening. We have brought him to Delhi and are interrogating him. He has confessed to having raped the minor girl,? added Baaniya. Sources said Sajid has denied his role in attack on the girl?s mother. Senior police officer said that they have identified the men who fired at the woman. ?Raids are on to nab them. They will be caught soon,? added Baaniya.

CAG criticises Indian Railways over dirty linen and blankets,"The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has criticised the railways over cleanliness and management of linen, and suggested putting in place a mechanism to ensure strict compliance to norms.In its report tabled in Parliament on Friday, the country?s top auditor said the washing and sanitation of linen as well as blankets are not done as per the norms established by the railways.The Railway Board has instructed that washing of linen (except blankets) should be done after every single use and blankets be dry-cleaned every two months.?Various zonal railways had provided periodicity of once every fortnight/month/once in two-three months for washing blankets,? said the CAG report.The CAG has collected data on number of blankets in use and those washed during the review (2012-2013 to 2015-2016) period in 33 selected depots of coaches.It was found that in 14 selected depots, under nine zonal railways, no blankets had been dry-washed in the said period. And except for seven depots under five zonal railways, linens had not been sanitised in the other selected depots, the CAG has said.During 2015-2016, in respect of 12 coaching depots of eight zonal railways, blankets had been washed after an interval of 6-26 months, the report stated.These depots included Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (Mumbai), Sealdah (Kolkata), Gwalior, Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Secunderabad, and Hatia and Tatanagar (in Jharkhand).The report also said there were general stores depots which stored fresh linens along with those that were to be discarded. At the Basin Bridge depot in Chennai, pillow covers were being stitched from the used bedsheets to tide over shortages.In a few cases, in the Northern Railway, used pillow covers were provided to the passengers, the report said.The audit report said there was a need for the railways to increase the pace of setting up of mechanised laundries and prescribe norms for quality standards for washed linen.?A mechanism may be put in place to ensure strict compliance to norms of cleaning blankets and pillows as per required periodicity,? it said.The CAG also said at many storage depots, fresh linen was stored haphazardly and was exposed to dirt and contamination.?Proper storage space may be provided for storage of linen in store depots, so that linen can be issued in an organised manner,? it recommended.It has also advocated providing ?adequate storage space? for linen in coaching depots.In Western Railway, new linen was stored in a manner that they were exposed to dirt in storage depots in Mahalakshmi and Sabarmati. At the store in Kharagpur, face towels were kept in a room with broken windows susceptible to damage due to seepage of rainwater.In some zonal railways, new stock remained unutilised almost all their life span.In North Eastern Railway, the audit said, the stock at the depots had already completed two-to-seven months life from the date of manufacture before it was received at the Gorakhpur depot.In the South Eastern Railway, bedsheets (life cycle of 12 months) and pillow covers (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for seven months and similarly face towels (life cycle of nine months) remained unutilised for five months at the depots.?This indicated that lot received first were not issued first,? the audit said.In case of pillows too, instructions were not followed, it said.?Blankets and pillows were not dry cleaned and/or sanitised for long periods before supply to the passengers,? the audit said.The audit report also recommended that railways seek regular feedback from passengers to effectively improve passenger satisfaction in respect of quality of linen.",general,3646,60,70

"Rains, not BMC responsible for waterlogging in Mumbai: Sena","Even as the downpour in the city continued on Tuesday leading to commuter woes, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday defended the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and blamed the rain instead. Thackeray was speaking at the inauguration of the newly refurbished Mahakavi Kalidas Natyamandir arts theatre at Mulund. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, however, gave the function a miss, highlighting the strained relations between the allies. Speaking at the function, Uddhav Thackeray said what could the BMC do if it rained heavily.He said that the city didn?t witness much water logging this year so far and expressed confidence that Mumbai would not get submerged. ?But then what would the BMC do if it rains heavily?? he said. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders who boycotted the event said that they had written to mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar to invite chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for the event, which the corporation failed to. Corporators also said that the municipal commissioner had initiated an inquiry into the functioning of the theatre. The Priyadarshini sports complex, where the theatre stands, was handed over to the trust Brihanmumbai Krida and Lalitkala Pratisthan (BKLP) on a 30-year lease in 1990. BKLP is headed by Shiv Sena leader Aadesh Bandekar. Local BJP corporator Prakash Gangadhare has accused the trust of financial irregularities and illegal activities. Gangadhare said, ?The municipal commissioner has already ordered an inquiry into the irregularities. We opposed it because the mayor failed to invite the chief minister for the inauguration.?Ironically, T ward of Mulund is represented only by BJP leaders at the corporation, the state legislature and even the Parliament. Kalidas was refurbished at a cost of Rs27crore by the civic body. Mahadeshwar said, ?I don?t know anything about BJP?s boycott. Anybody can boycott an event in a democracy.Our motive was to re-open the art theatre as soon as possible for citizen?s benefit.?",general,1967,59,70

26 CAs under scrutiny for alleged links with shell companies,"New Delhi, Jul 23 (PTI) At least 26 chartered accountants have come under the scanner of the ICAI for allegedly helping shell companies, a senior official said. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is the regulator for accountancy professionals and can initiate disciplinary action against erring members. ""The role of (around) 26 chartered accountants with respect to their alleged links with shell companies are being looked into by the institute,"" ICAI President Nilesh Shivji Vikamsey told PTI. As the government continues its clamp down on shell companies in efforts to deal with the black money menace, many entities have come under the lens of various agencies, including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). Vikamsey said reference about the 26 chartered accountants came from the SFIO and details about them are being collected. The ICAI can initiate stringent disciplinary proceedings against members violating norms. The measures can include suspension and even cancelling their registrations. Shell companies are dubious entities that are generally used for laundering illegal funds. However, the term shell company is not defined under the companies law. At ICAIs foundation day function on July 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought to send out a strong message against chartered accountants trying to help entities in black money dealings.

US court allows Trump commission to collect voter data,"A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for Donald Trump?s commission on election fraud to resume collecting detailed voter roll information from the states.The commission asked states last month to provide publicly available data including registered voters? names, birth dates and partial social security numbers, but it later told them to hold off until a judge ruled on a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) in Washington. The US district court judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, in the District of Columbia, denied the advocacy group?s request to block the data collection in a ruling that the commission?s vice-chairman, Kris Kobach, called ?a major victory for government accountability, transparency and the public?s right to know about the integrity of our elections processes?.?The commission requested this publicly available data as part of its fact-gathering process, which is information that states regularly release to political candidates, political parties and the general public,? said Kobach, the Republican secretary of state in Kansas. ?We look forward to continuing to work with state election leaders to gather information and identify opportunities to improve election integrity.? Nearly two weeks ago, the Trump administration had appeared to back away from its extraordinary attempt to gather voters? personal information, following a barrage of legal challenges and furious backlash from state officials as well as the public over privacy concerns. In addition, while Kobach has said that the effort was aimed at stopping voter fraud, his detractors say he is looking for a solution to a non-existent problem. They have also accused him of using it as a backdoor effort at mass voter suppression.The privacy group had argued in its suit that the commission should have completed an assessment of privacy concerns before making the request. The judge found that the group had standing to make that argument but said the commission was not an agency and therefore was not required to do such assessments. The judge also found the group failed to show that its members would be harmed by the data collection. ?The only practical harm the plaintiff?s advisory board members would suffer ... is that their already publicly available information would be rendered more easily accessible by virtue of its consolidation on the computer systems that would ultimately receive this information on behalf of the commission,? the judge said. She did not say that any states must comply with the commission?s request. The privacy group said it would be watching closely to see what the commission did next. ?The commission cannot evade privacy obligations by playing a shell game with the nation?s voting records,? Epic?s president, Marc Rotenberg, said. Similar lawsuits are pending in Texas, Florida and New Hampshire. The New Hampshire lawsuit, brought by two lawmakers and an American Civil Liberties Union chapter, was put on hold pending the outcome of the Washington case. Trump, a Republican, created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May to investigate his allegations, offered without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in 2016. At the panel?s first meeting last week, he questioned the motives of states that have refused to comply with the commission?s request, suggesting they had something to hide. Before the commission paused data collection earlier this month, an Associated Press count of states? responses found 17, plus Washington DC, did not plan to provide any information. Election officials in some of those states questioned the commission?s intent to search for voter fraud; in some states, the main concern was voters? privacy. Thirty states said they would provide limited information that was considered public already. And some of those states said the commission would have some hoops to jump through such as paying for the data or filling out additional request forms. Alabama, Hawaii and Idaho had not announced decisions about whether to comply.",politics,4064,54,70

Singers liked till they sing playback for major stars: Ankit,"Singer-composer Ankit Tiwari has some substantial work behind him in Bollywood, but he still seeks an identity that?s truly his own, independent of the glitz of cinema and the limitations of being a playback artist. The 31-year-old shot to fame with the chartbuster song Sunn Raha Hai Na Tu from the film Aashiqui 2 (2013). Later, he composed for Aamir Khan?s blockbuster PK (2014). Other hits include Tu Hai Ki Nahin (Roy, 2015), Dil Cheez Tujhe Dedi (Airlift, 2016), Tere Liye (Sanam Re, 2016). Despite this, Ankit isn?t fulfilled. ?People only like singers till the time their songs are featured in films, ya jab tak kisi bade hero ki playback karte hain (or as long as one sings playback for a major star),? he says.?Singing for someone else means that singers aur musicians ki apni koi pehchaan nahi hoti (singers and musicians get no recognition on their own). I?m searching for that pehchaan (identity / recognition) through my independent singles,? says Ankit, who is now working on a project titled Originals by Ankit. He will release 12 non-film songs on YouTube, one each month consecutively for a year.Though he isn?t known to be a songwriter, Ankit feels for lyricists ? here?s a group that contributes much to a film?s success but gets little praise for it, he says. ?The most thankless job in our film industry is that of lyricists. Next in the list are writers. These two don?t get any recognition at all, whereas they have the most important roles in every film today,? the singer adds.Success has brought along a disadvantage for him, says Ankit. ?The biggest change for me,? he says, ?was that ki jab mere baare mein kisi ko pata hi nahi tha (when no one knew about me), there was a margin of error.

300 WhatsApp groups used to mobilise stone-pelters in J&K,"encounter sites: Official Srinagar, Apr 23 (PTI) Nearly 300 Whatsapp groups were being used to mobilise stone-pelters in Kashmir to disrupt security forces operations at encounter sites, of which 90 per cent have been shut down, a police official said today. Each of these 300 Whatsapp groups had around 250 members, the official said while explaining how determined attempts were being made to disrupt the operations of the security forces by mobilising stone-pelting mobs at the encounter sites. ""We identified the groups and the group administrators, who were called in by police for counselling. We have had a good response to this initiative,"" he said on the condition of anonymity. In the last three weeks, more than 90 per cent of these Whatsapp groups have been shut down, the official said. He said the governments policy of suspending internet services appeared to be showing positive results in curbing stone-pelting during encounters and cited the case of yesterdays encounter in Budgam district. Just a few youth gathered to hurl stones after two militants were gunned down in the encounter yesterday. This was in sharp contrast to an encounter in Durbugh village in the same area on March 28, when a large number of stone-pelters had assembled and three of them were killed in firing by security forces. ""With no internet services, the mobilisation of mobs has almost become impossible. Earlier, we would see youth from as far as 10 kilometres from the encounter sites joining the protesters to pelt stones at security forces to disrupt the anti-militancy operations. ""That did not happen yesterday during or after the encounter in the absence of internet on mobiles,"" the official said. He said some of the youth listed personal issues like alleged harassment by security forces as reasons for taking to stone-pelting. ""Most of them get carried away momentarily,"" he said, adding authorities are also looking at further sensitising the personnel on the need to adopt a humane approach while dealing with the youth. ""With the internet facility withdrawn, the activity on these social networking groups and other sites like Facebook has come down drastically,"" he added. Stone-pelting on security forces near the encounter sites has been causing major operational problems for the law enforcing agencies over the past one year. More than half a dozen youth have been killed in such incidents in the first quarter of this year. However, the common people especially those from the business community say they are facing hardships, because of the inability to stay connected online. ""Today, the business depends on internet for communication. I am into stock markets and I have had no business since the mobile internet services were withdrawn on Monday,"" Mudasir Bhat said.

Pak court begins hearing against PM Sharif in Panama case,"Pakistan?s supreme court has begun hearings that will decide the future of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is fighting for his job and contesting a damning corruption report by an investigative panel. The supreme court is expected to order Sharif be tried Sharif on corruption charges, or disqualify him, but few expect the judges to dismiss the case after the panel tabled a damaging 254-page report into his family wealth. Sharif has denied any wrongdoing after the report alleged his family?s vast wealth was beyond their means and accused his children, including presumed heir Maryam, of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of four flats in London?s Mayfair. Sharif, 67, has rejected demands by opposition parties to resign, warning his replacement would destabilise the country and imperil hard-won economic gains since his poll victory in 2013.?It hurts that despite all of our hard work, attempts are afoot once again to push the country back,? Sharif told a meeting of his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party at the weekend.In April Sharif narrowly escaped disqualification after the supreme court ruled there was insufficient evidence to remove him ? by a 2-3 split ? over documents released by the Panama Papers leak into offshore wealth. But it ordered further investigations, and the formation of the joint investigation team (JIT) panel. Sharif has talked of a conspiracy against him, but has not named anyone. His allies, however, privately claim that elements of Pakistan?s powerful military and the judiciary are bent on toppling him. The army spokesman brushed aside questions about claims the military?s hidden hand was the driving force behind the JIT investigation, saying ?the Pakistan army is not directly connected?. The six-person JIT panel included one member from the military intelligence agency and another from the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, the country?s top spy agency. Sharif, the son of an industrialist, is serving his third term in power and has had a fractious relationship with the army. He was originally nurtured by the military as a civilian politician who would protect their interests, and he served as prime minister twice in the 1990s. But relations soured and his second stint as prime minister ended when he was ousted in a 1999 coup leading to a decade of exile. Relations with the military during the current term have also been tense. Sharif?s legal team and the opposition will be given a chance to contest the JIT findings and Sharif is also expected to be summoned to appear before the court in coming days or weeks. Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting claims of conspiracy to save his skin and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he should step down. Imran Khan, the opposition leader who pushed the hardest for Sharif to be investigated, said the prime minister would end up in jail, and vowed protests if he was not ousted by the court. ?Either we will celebrate in Islamabad or otherwise we will hit the streets to save our democracy and to make sure we send this mafia to Adiyala jail,? Khan told supporters.",world,3137,57,70

DMK chief Karunanidhi misses first party meeting in 48 years,"In a general body meeting of DMK in which M Karunanidhi didn't participate, for the first time in 48 years, MK Stalin was today elevated as 'working president' of DMK at its general body meeting in which party partriach M Karunanidhi didn't participate for the first time in 48 years.Stalin the second son of Dayalu Ammal and Karunanidhi had won over the internal battles within the party to become the 'working president'. His main hurdle was his elder brother MK Alagiri, who controlled the southern helm of Tamil Nadu until the period he was evicted from the party. WILL DO WHAT KARUNA SAYS: STALIN""Our leader is someone who gives rest to retirement but unfortunately he needs rest now and as a working president I shall stand by his views and do what he says,"" Stalin said after taking charge.Stalin clarified that his post as a working president is not a post but a responsibility.As the meet got over, Stalin left for Gopalapuram to meet his father and DMK chief Karunanidhi to seek his blessings. THE STALIN-ALAGIRI WARBy 2012-13, Stalin began a passive cleansing process within the party where his confidantes replaced those who were loyal to Alagiri. This angered Alagiri who openly spoke against Stalin and the party making his father furious. The already suspended South Zone Organisational Secretary was expelled on March, 2014.Alagiri complained that his father was acting partial towards him favouring Stalin. ""DMK needs to get rid of thieves,"" Alagiri once said. Even after the drama that ensued, Alagiri tried to meet his father on many occasions but failed until recently when Karunanidhi was hospitalised The rivalry between the two brothers didn't end.The expulsion of Alagiri also brought Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimozi's position within the party under question as she was much closer to Alagiri. It was believed that anytime a question on handing over authority to a successor was put forward to Karunanidhi, the Dravidian stalwart would only give an indirect reply keeping the leadership in uncertainty as he knew that it was the only thing that kept his family together at peace.But as his health deteriorated recently and with the death of former CM and AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, Stalin's supporters raised flags within the party to make him the next leader.Party insiders were a bit appalled to know that the Stalin camp, demanded absolute power before becoming a working president. INSIDE DMK'S GENERAL BODY MEETINGThe DMK must be applauded for its act of passing a resolution, a homage message to the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.Then, as party's deputy legislative Assembly leader Thuraimurugan brought forth MK Stalin's name for the post, party general secretary, Anbazagan concurred it.Speaking during the meet, Thuraimurugan broke down to see that his leader is unable to participate but for the betterment of the party agreed to the fact that the party needed a 'working president'. Even then, taking a dig at the recently conducted AIADMK general body meeting, Thuraimurgan said that DMK is a party that gives importance to 'self-respect' more than anything.'A DELAYED DECISION'Senior journalist Gnanisankaran called Stalin's elevation as a delayed decision.

Poor's Right to Life more crucial than rich's privacy: Govt,"The Aadhaar hearing in the Supreme Court is fast turning into a right to privacy raised by the ""elite"" class versus right to life for millions of poor in the country. Strongly backing the Aadhaar scheme, the Modi government on Wednesday submitted before the Supreme Court that the right to life of millions of poor in the country through food, shelter and welfare measures was far more important than privacy concerns raised by the elite class. Controversially, Attorney General K K Venugopal arguing for the Centre also stated that privacy claims required better priority in developed countries ""not in a country like India where a vast majority of citizens don't have access to basic needs"". He said right to privacy cannot be invoked to scrap the Aadhaar scheme. The government was categorical that after enrolling nearly 100 crore citizens spending an astronomical amount of Rs 6,300 crore there was no going back. 'AADHAAR ESSENTIAL FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE'The AG attempted to drive home the point that Aadhaar was essential for good governance, transparent implementation of government programmes and to ensure that benefits reach only those who qualify to get them and not ghost beneficiaries. ""Through aadhaar, benefits of welfare schemes reaches only those who are entitled to it. Depriving large sections of people of food, shelter and welfare schemes is also depriving them of fundamental right to live. Biometric details for aadhaar is essential for saving prople from animal existence"", Venugopal told a nine-judge bench which is deciding whether right to privacy should be declared a fundamental right. At one point, Justice D Y Chandrachud, who was part of the bench, interjected the AG saying privacy is not an elitist concern and it is equally applicable to the large masses. ""For example, if state wants forced sterilisation on say slum dwellers for population control among that group, perhaps only privacy claim may stand in the way"", said Justice Chandrachud.""Privacy is ingrained in right to life and liberty...each one of them cannot be and need not be elevated as a fundamental right. It has to be on a case to case basis. Privacy is just one specie like right to have passport, right not to be handcuffed they are various specie of public liberty"", argued Venugopal.He also reminded the bench that ""world bank has said all countries must follow aadhaar- like model"".'TRANSGRESSION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS'The bench is hearing PILs filed by a retired Karnataka High Court judge K. Puttaswamy, and social activist Aruna Roy against making the cards mandatory for accessing government schemes and subsidies.They argued that the manner in which biometric information is extracted violates and transgresses individual rights of citizens including privacy.The PILs had said the manner in which biometric details are collected by private contractors and NGOs hired by UIDAI without any safeguard makes them prone to misuse.

Inaugurated 13 years ago, the facility had fallen prey to negligence of the civic body, thus losing sheen soon after its opening. The two-storeyed haveli has been lying locked for almost a decade. The number of visitors dwindled over the years and encroachers returned to the site. In want of adequate maintenance, the about 1,000-yard structure has turned into a dump. Union youth affairs and sport minister Vijay Goel, who initiated the project during his second term as a Member of Parliament from Chandni Chowk around 2004, had sent a proposal to the culture ministry seeking funds for the restoration of the facility as ?a heritage museum and interpretation of Shahjahanabad?. The proposal was prepared by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). After examining the scheme, the ministry gave its approval in March, but the work could not be initiated as the fund was not transferred. ?The first instalment, a grant of Rs 1.69 crore, has just been released to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the nodal agency for executing the restoration project. I expect the work to begin soon,? said Goel.However, the minister added that he wanted a non-government agency to take up the project. ?I don?t trust the municipal corporation. I want other agencies like INTACH or similar bodies to be roped in for the purpose. The project is getting delayed because of the corporation?s lackadaisical attitude,? he said. As per the revival plan, artifacts, articles, rare photos and paintings depicting the culture and lifestyle of early residents of Shahjahanabad (during Mughal period) is slated to be exhibited. A library with a space for research scholars is part of the plan. This will be a one-stop destination, where a visitor will be able to study the composite culture of the Walled City under one roof, said Goel.?Articles like utensils, garments and other exhibits such as hookah will be displayed. Literature pertaining to the city and the history of the place since its inception will also be provided, so that people coming to the museum can learn about it. We will also brief tourists about places to see in old Delhi and what to eat where. We basically aim to recreate the scene of yesteryears,? the minister said. Once it is restored, cultural events are also likely to be hosted here. The haveli was constructed in 1929. Until it was turned into a museum, a municipal dispensary was being run in its two of its rooms and the remaining part was abandoned. Goel contributed funds from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund to restore the building as the Walled City museum.",general,2877,58,70
Pak-origin London Bridge terrorist buried in secret: Report,"The Pakistani-origin terrorist behind the London Bridge terror attack, Khuram Shazad Butt, has been buried in secret after a number of cemeteries in the UK refused to accept the body, a media report said on Sunday.A relative of the 27-year-old drove his body to a graveyard near the family home in East London recently where he was buried without any rites or mourners, the Sunday Mirror reported.?The family are distraught with what he did but he is still their son and brother. His mother is not in a good way health-wise after what has happened so it was decided she should not attend,? the newspaper quoted a source as saying.The family feared any ceremony could be too traumatic and draw negative attention.Butt?s friends and associates were not notified of the burial.Butt was the ringleader of the attack in London Bridge and nearby Borough Market last month.He and two others drove a van into pedestrians before stabbing and slashing revellers enjoying a night out.Seven victims died, dozens were hurt and Butt and the two other terrorists were shot dead.Butt became radicalised after watching hate preachers on YouTube before becoming linked to Al Muhajiroun, the banned extremist group whose leader, Anjem Choudary, is in jail and now moved to an isolation unit.",world,1273,59,70

""In (the) earlier government, every minister thought of themselves as the PM,"" Shah said.His comments came at a press conference in Mumbai, where he earlier met with members of the Maharashtra BJP unit's core committee. He's on a 3-day tour of Mumbai ahead of the Presidential polls.On the Shiv Sena's proposals for the Presidential nomination, Shah said his party was open to all suggestions.The Sena on Friday said RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was its first choice for the post.

Note ban opens up new channels of corruption: Economist Kurz,"New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Describing demonetisation as an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg, eminent Austrian economist Heinz D Kurz has said it is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to root out corruption. Actually, he said, the Indian governments move opened up new avenues of corruption. ""As far as I understand the situation, the policy of demonetisation has already been abandoned by the government, because it turned out to be an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg. ""I strongly doubt that the demonetisation exercise will root out corruption and engender more transparency. It is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to achieve these goals,"" Kurz told PTI in an interview. ""By introducing the Rs 2,000 banknote, a currency of twice or even four times the value of the banknotes that have been declared illegal, in the system... This can hardly be called demonetisation,"" he added. Kurz is a professor of economics at the University of Graz, Austria. Noting that while the goal of fighting corruption is laudable, he said: ""I consider it to be singularly naive to think that this can be done by banning some banknotes. ""There appears also to be evidence that the policy of demonetisation opened new channels of corruption."" Kurz pointed out that whoever was informed about the demonetisation policy ahead of its introduction (sort of insider trading) could have used the information and laundered money. Also, he further said Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes brought to banks were apparently counted, but not scrutinised as to whether it was counterfeit money. Asked about impact of demonetisation on Indias economic growth, Kurz said that ""first, it is much too early to assess already the impact of demonetisation, which will show up only later. Secondly, the data published are rough estimates that do not, and could not possibly, take account of this impact"". ""It would therefore be wrong to infer that demonetisation had no effect on the economy,"" he noted. The Indian economy is going pretty strong, Kurtz said, adding however that not well thought out policies such as the demonetisation project have the potential of affecting it badly.",general,2180,60,70

Maha hikes compensation for rape survivors to ?10 lakh,"The Maharashtra government has decided to increase compensation for rape and acid attack survivors to Rs10 lakh. This compensation, however, will be for those survivors, who have been meted with the most horrific acts of violence, including gang-rape, leading to physical and mental disability. The state cabinet on Tuesday took this decision to increase the compensation offered under the 2013 ?Manodhairya? scheme to provide financial assistance to survivors. The scheme offered assistance of up to Rs3 lakh. ?In cases where women face gang-rape or permanent physical or mental disability through violent actions, such survivors need the maximum amount of help for rehabilitation. But there may also be other cases where rape is attempted on the pretext of marriage or the crime doesn?t lead to permanent physical trauma or disfigurement. Considering this, we have categorised compensation for different cases,? said Vinita Singhal, principal secretary, women and child development department.?In the most cruel crime, where the survivor faces permanent disability, financial assistance will be Rs10 lakh. Of this, 25% or Rs2.5 lakh will be disbursed immediately to the survivor while the remaning Rs7.5 lakh will be a fixed deposit in the bank and the survivor will continue to get monthly interest on it,? she said.For other cases, the monetary help will be Rs3 lakh, Rs2 lakh and Rs1 lakhUnder the old scheme, the state government would give a maximum of Rs3 lakh to survivors who suffered from complete disfigurement of the face or physical handicap in case of an acid attack, while those with minor injuries were getting Rs50,000.Apart from the monetary compensation, the government, under this scheme, also provides counselling to the survivors and vocational or educational training.",general,1793,55,70
UP government makes registration of marriages compulsory,"The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday approved a proposal to make registration of marriages compulsory for every resident of the state, regardless of religion or community.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath presided over a cabinet meeting to adopt the Uttar Pradesh Marriage Registration Rules-2017, which stipulates compulsory registration of marital alliances and lays down penalties for any delay in this regard. Though the fines are not particularly hefty ? Rs 10 for delay up to a year and Rs 50 beyond that period ? it is liable to increase over time. ?We took all sections of society into confidence before taking a decision on the issue,? health minister Siddharth Nath Singh told mediapersons later in the day.However, Singh admitted that the cabinet did not concede to demands from a few Muslim clerics who wanted their community exempt from having to furnish photographs of the bride and groom. ?Yes, they made such a demand because the nikahnama (the Islamic marriage contract) does not carry images. But if photographs can be submitted to procure documents such as Aadhaar cards, I don?t see why the same cannot be done for marriage registration,? he said.While the stamps and registration department will double as the nodal agency for marriage registration, the government will launch an online portal to ensure easy access. The Centre had already made marriage registration compulsory across the country, in keeping with a 2006 Supreme Court ruling. Uttar Pradesh was among the only two states that had failed to implement the directive, an anomaly that minister for women welfare and tourism development Rita Bahuguna Joshi had earlier vowed to rectify. ?We will implement the Supreme Court?s order in the state. A cabinet note is being prepared, and the same will be sent for the cabinet?s approval,? she had said.The erstwhile Samajwadi Party government had deferred taking a decision on the matter in view of strong objections from Muslims. Community leaders maintained that as the nikahnama contains all the relevant details pertaining to marriages, the state should treat it as a valid substitute for the registration certificate.",general,2148,56,70
Jawan killed in accident saves lives by donating 6 organs,"He could not serve the nation and its people while alive. But in death, 22-year-old ITBP recruit Roshan Kumar became the saviour for half a dozen families. Days after he received news of his first posting with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Uttarakhand native died in a road accident last week in Delhi's Dwarka area where he was visiting relatives. But six of his vital organs became life-savers for as many transplant patients at hospitals in the Capital. India has a huge gap in demand and supply of organs. Experts say many people are unwilling to donate relatives' organs due to religious beliefs, because they don't understand how it works, or because it is too difficult to do so due to red tape. Roshan belonged to an army background, and was brought up by an uncle. ""When he was just one year old, his parents died. I looked after him. From his very childhood and schooldays he wanted to become a soldier and serve the country. For this, he worked very hard. His dream was about to become reality. Now Roshan is not at the border to protect the country. But I am proud to say that he served the nation by saving six lives,"" Roshan's uncle told Mail Today, requesting anonymity. According to government data, about 2 lakh people are waitlisted for kidneys and 30,000 for livers. Legal donations meet about 3 to 5 per cent of the demand. ROSHAN WAS HIT BY A SPEEDING BIKEIn desperation, some patients on the waiting list seek the services of middlemen to procure organs for money illegally. Dr AK Rai, medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, ""Last week, late night we received a call from a Dwarka-based hospital that they were referring a severely injured accident patient to us. We activated our expert team as the patient had very little chance of survival. Even in the time of grief, family members of the deceased agreed to donate the organs of their young son to fulfil his only wish to serve the country."" Roshan was on foot when he was hit by a speeding bike and fell, receiving serious brain injuries.Doctors retrieved the organs in quick time. ""After the patient was declared brain dead and the family agreed to donate his all organs, experts' team from NOTTO (National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation) and Safdarjung Hospital started the procedure of organ retrieval,"" said (Prof) Dr Anup Kumar, head of renal transplant department at Safdarjung. HE SERVED HIS NATION IN DEATH""All potential organs such as eyes, heart, liver, kidneys and intestine were procured, which gave fresh lease of life to six patients. Two people got eyes and one patient at AIIMS received the heart. Two patients got kidneys, one got a liver and the intestines were sent to Medanta hospital."" Roshan's act is a message of brotherhood and harmony for the nation, say doctors. ""He is a gem,"" Dr Kumar said. ""One of his kidneys was transplanted to a Muslim patient at Safardjung Hospital who was on dialysis for two years and could not find any donor."" Speaking to Mail Today, 47-year-old Parvez Alam who stays at Khanpur in south Delhi, said, ""I am blessed that I have received a kidney from a Hindu patient who was brain dead. Roshan proved Hindu-Muslim Bhai Bhai. I was searching for a kidney for the past two years, but the miracle happened when I was in the last stage of dialysis. May Roshan's soul rest in peace.""

Amateur swimmers allowed burkinis in competitions in England,"London, Mar 5 (PTI) Muslim women swimmers have won the right to race in loose-fitting full body outfits or burkinis while taking part in amateur swimming competitions in England. On a request from the Muslim Womens Sport Foundation, the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) has relaxed its swimsuit regulations to allow women to wear loose-fitting full body outfits. Until now, full body suits like those worn by Olympians have been banned, as they help streamline the shape of the body and have performance-enhancing characteristics. The new guidance, which will only apply to amateur competitions in England, states that competitors will not be allowed to wear any suit that a competition referee believes will increase performance, The Telegraph reported. Photographs published by the governing body suggested that loose-fitting outfits would be permissible, while specifically excluding body suits similar to those worn by elite competitors. ""Swimmers wishing to swim in such a suit shall present the suit to the event referee for inspection prior to their swim,"" the guidance states. ""Once the referee has been informed of a swimmer wishing to wear a suit, as described above, there is no requirement for the referee to question the swimmer further, the ASA swimming management group do not want athletes being asked why they wish to wear the suit,"" it says. Chris Bostock, chairman of the ASA sport governing board, termed the move as a ""very positive step forward"" for competitive swimming in England and one that he hoped would encourage many more people to take part.",general,1575,60,70

Art of Living event destroyed Yamuna floodplains: NGT panel,"The damage to the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Living?s three-day cultural festival last year will cost more than Rs 42 crore and at least 10 years to fix, according to the expert panel appointed by the National Green Tribunal.The Foundation has, however, called the committee biased and acting with vested interests.The expert panel, headed by Shashi Shekhar, secretary of ministry of water resources, submitted its report to the NGT on Wednesday, on damage assessment following the Art of Living?s three-day World Culture Festival in March 2016.The panel has suggested a time-bound action plan, which comprises two components - physical and biological rehabilitation. The physical component is estimated to cost around Rs 28.73 crore and the biological part would cost around Rs 13.29 crore.?In addition to this, there would be expenditure for the monitoring by a team of experts for 10 years and the cost of transportation of material outside the floodplain,? said an expert.The 47-page report estimates that approximately 120 hectares (about 300 acres) of floodplains of west (right bank) of the river Yamuna and about 50 hectares (120 acres) floodplains of the eastern side (left bank) of the river have been adversely impacted ecologically at different magnitudes.The Art of Living spokesperson, however, has alleged ?bias beyond doubt.??The Expert Committee members of the NGT who were supposed to be non-interested parties to the case and were to act as the eyes and ears of judges have given biased interviews in public while the case is sub-judice... The closeness of the petitioner with the expert committee members was not disclosed to us when it was appointed by NGT and went into the preparation of the report,? said Kedar Desai, the spokesperson.Desai said the Art of Living Foundation is a ?responsible and environmentally sensitive NGO? and its legal team will be looking into the report to decide on the appropriate future action.The NGT had allowed the festival in March 2016, saying that as the matter was ?fait accompli?, they could not ban it. The three-day World Cultural Festival soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and damaging the Yamuna floodplain ecosystem.The NGT slapped an interim fine Rs 5 crore on the Foundation for environmental damage while efforts were made to ascertain the exact costs of the damage.An initial four-member committee had recommended that the Foundation pay Rs100 to Rs 120 crores as compensation for the restoration work.The green court had later asked an expert panel of seven members to estimate the damage to the floodplains and how much it would cost to fix these damages. This committee observed that the festival had ?completely destroyed, not simply damaged? the riverfront area between DND flyover and the Barapulla drain, which had served as the main event site.?The ground is now totally levelled, compacted and hardened and is totally devoid of water bodies or depressions and almost completely devoid of any vegetation.?Huge amount of earth and debris have been dumped to construct the ramps for access from the DND flyover and from the two pontoon bridges across the Barapulla drain,? the report said.It said the floodplain was severely harmed and ?almost all its natural vegetation? was lost, affecting the natural habitat of a large number animals, insects and other organisms.",general,3368,59,70

Bengaluru witnesses its first lesbian marriage,"At a time when the Indian society has just begun to come to terms with homosexuality, case of an alleged lesbian wedding in Bengaluru has become a point of discussion .It is believed that a 25-year-old woman married another 21-year-old woman at a temple in Koramangala.The parents of one of the girls had filed a missing complaint only to later find out that their daughter was not only in a lesbian relationship , she had also married another woman at a temple in the city.The 21-year-old girl is allegedly now being counselled by the Vanita Sahaya Vani, the women's grievance cell of the police. The marriage is not legal after Supreme Court decriminalised section 377 in 2013.The story of the two women is just like any other love story. The older lady was fascinated by the younger one and have been together as they are distant relatives.The older lady said that she was so in love with her wife that she used to take her shopping and buy her expensive gifts.At one point of time, the older lady expressed her love only to meet with rejection. The older woman pursued and convinced the younger one to marry her. Today, they claim to be a 'couple madly in love' with each other. COUPLE TRACED TO KORMANGALA APARTMENT Based on the missing complaint filed by the younger woman's family, the police initiated a search operation and traced them to an apartment in Koramangala.The couple tried to seek help of an NGO to fight their case and also to let their family and police know that they are happy together and as adults have taken their own decisions.As of now , the police is perplexed as to how to pursue this case, while the 'wife' is undergoing counseling.While many feel that the whole idea of criminalising homosexuality was to bring sanity in society, but legal experts feel that the SC order was clear that one cannot be booked for being lesbian or gay. It needs to be taken on a case by case situation.But to legally take action or even arrest, one of them needs to file a complaint or else it will not stand strong in the court.Also Read:",general,2054,46,70

UAE envoy denies seizure of Dawood Ibrahim's assets,"United Arab Emirates' envoy to India Ahmed Al Banna has denied media reports that wanted underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's properties and assets were raided in UAE.He dismissed the media reports that claimed property worth Rs 15,000 crore had been seized.A couple of weeks ago when reports about raids on Dawood's properties surfaced, even BJP's official social media handles went on an overdrive, claiming it to be a masterstroke of PM Modi's diplomacy.INDIA TODAY EXCLUSIVE: India media has already painted me black, says Dawood IbrahimA series of tweets had credited PM Modi's diplomacy with the success. It said, the prime minister had handed over a list of Dawood's properties during his visit to the UAE in 2015, and demanded the authorities to act against Dawood.Speaking exclusively to India Today, UAE envoy Al Banna said a legal process has to be followed in the country for an action against any individual. EXCERPTS FROM THE INTERVIEW:Q: Coming to area of security cooperation, in recent years we have seen an extradition treaty between India and UAE and some individuals have been deported. In terms of one specific name Dawood Ibrahim, there were reports that NSA Ajit Doval has handed over a dossier to UAE, can you confirm it sir?A: Well, I know there are international laws, rules and regulations, there are bilateral agreements and those agreements you know finalises any or emphasises on any decision that a country might take in terms of extraditing. Now, there is judicial system and there is a legal system and within the international framework within those agreements signed, the judicial and legal system works.

Again, we don't know whether it is true, untrue. Would you like to confirm?A: This is the first time I hear of it. I don't know anything of that as I mentioned UAE is a country where there are rules, regulations, laws, constitution and if there are any proceedings in our legal system, within our jurisdiction system then let it be. I don't think any action can be taken against anyone without that legal process, without the jurisdiction process.Q: But if you find substance in India's evidences against Dawood Ibrahim, the UAE will act?A: Then again, there are agreements as I said. The agreements between India and UAE will handle that and the meetings that will take place will handle that.WATCH:",general,2778,51,70

The last policy came in 2001.An initial draft was first issued in May 2016 following which the Prime Minister?s Office (PMO) constituted a group of ministers, which suggested some changes.Making the initial draft public last year, WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi had said the aim of the government was to shift from entitlements to rights and from empowerment to creating an enabling environment for women.",science,1653,52,70

Gandhi was once called 'half-naked fakir' by Churchill,"It now appears that Winston Churchill's ""seditious fakir"" comment during his wilderness years is linked to an occasion when Mahatma Gandhi posed for portraits at Kingsley Hall in London.The painting, by Ukrainian-born artist Jacob Kramer who spent all his working life in England, was made when Gandhi was at the Second Round Table Conference in 1931.During the London visit, Gandhi had invited Kramer to capture his likeness for posterity. The image, made with black and white chalk on buff paper, shows the icon of peaceful protests smiling mischievously, seemingly aware that he had the British Establishment on the run.In London from September 12 to December 5, 1931, Gandhi stayed at Kingsley Hall and used an office at 88 Knightsbridge during this visit. Here, according to the Mahatma's grandson Gopal Gandhi, a day was allotted to artists and Kramer is said to have made three or four drawings of the Mahatma.His impressions were published in the Yorkshire Post on January 31, 1948, after Gandhi's death: ""I was with him from 10.30 am until 6 pm. It was one of his silent days and neither of us spoke a word. But one did not need to speak to Gandhi to be aware of his personality. A shrivelled little man though he was, he filled that room with an extraordinary spiritual force. He was the most impressive subject I have ever had."" Gandhi had vowed to spend every Monday in silence.Shockingly, around the same time, the United Kingdom's future prime minister Winston Churchill (1940-1945 and 1951-1955) unflatteringly described Gandhi thus: ""It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious middle temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east, striding half-naked up the steps of the viceregal palace, while he is still organising and conducting a defiant campaign of civil disobedience, to parley on equal terms with the representative of the kingemperor.""",general,1906,54,70
Dhirubhai enjoyed creating wealth for people: Anil Ambani,"Mumbai, Jun 29 (PTI) Leading businessman Anil Ambani today said more than creating wealth for himself, his father late Dhirubhai Ambani derived greater happiness from creating wealth for masses. ""If you ever asked what part of being an entrepreneur he (late Ambani) enjoyed the most, he would say, I enjoy creating wealth. But what I enjoy even more is in creating wealth for the people of the country,"" the Anil Ambani Group chairman said while addressing an industry event here. It can be noted that the late Ambani, who had a humble beginning as a primary school teachers son in Gujarat, is regarded as the father of capital markets and the equity cult, who made millions of investors millionaires with the IPO of Reliance Textile Industries in 1977. A person who had put in Rs 1,000 then in the IPO is worth over a million today, going by the price of RIL. Stating that the launch of Kothari Pioneer Mutual Fund, which was countrys first private MF in 1993, was his (Dhirubhais) idea of achieving wealth creation for the masses, Anil said the launch of Reliance MF in 1995 was an added effort to achieve the same. He claimed that the launch of Reliance Growth and Reliance Vision funds in 1995 is justifiably regarded as a watershed event in the history of mutual funds in the country as these brought millions of retail investors into the capital markets and generated unprecedented wealth for them. He said Reliance MF has grown from an AUM (assets under management) of under Rs 60 crore in 1995 and Rs 2,200 crore in 2002 to Rs 2.25 trillion now, which is an over 100 times of growth, while the total AUM of the AMC (asset management company) currently is Rs 3.58 trillion. At the same time, the domestic mutual fund industry, with 5.7 crore individual accounts, has expanded its AUM to reach Rs 20 trillion. Describing free markets as the best invention, Ambani said that of all earthly inventions, the free market is perhaps the greatest force for economic good in human history. Hailing the governments focus on financial inclusion, he said the national rollout of JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile-as-digital-platform) has prepared the ground for bringing hundreds of millions of unbanked and excluded citizens into the financial system. Calling for a deeper penetration of financial products into the markets, he lamented, ""Even though 9/10 of us have a mobile phone and 3/10 of us have a smartphone, only 1/25 has an investment in a mutual fund.""",general,2460,57,70

Mumbai police arrest robbers who broke into 37 homes,"A woman from Chembur had gone to buy vegetables outside her building for a few minutes in April. When she returned she saw that her house was ransacked and her gold jewellery missing. Another woman in Shivaji Nagar went to her daughter?s school to pick her up and when she returned she found her house robbed.For the past one year, the Mumbai and Thane police were getting regular complaints of house break-ins within minutes by unknown thieves.After months of investigation and rounding up several history sheeters, the Tilak Nagar police found just one witness. He told the police that the robbers were dressed in jeans and t-shirts and had sunglasses. He said that the men got out of a Swift Desire and seemed to be guests at a house. However they left the building within 10 minutes, said the witness. ?We only knew that they drove a Swift Desire,? said inspector Santosh Kamble from Tilak Nagar police station.A team of three officers were then assigned to investigate the series of house break-ins. The officers, including PI Avinash Pore and PSI Amol Ambawane, found that the car that the robbers used had a number plate of a bullet bike from Meerut. The informers told the officers that this gang was from Meerut and travelled by car from Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai. The gang would stop on the way to Mumbai and break in to houses. ?The Meerut gang only chose two- or three-storey houses for a quick escape,? said Shahaji Umap, deputy commissioner of police (zone VI). After finding out that the men had rented an apartment in Mumbra, the police team searched the house to find their clothes and other belongings. ?The five had rented an expensive apartment, saying that they were engineers and had to travel a lot. They did so to avoid staying at lodges and hotels,? added Umap. The team then left for UP on July 5 where they traced the five people who stayed in Meerut and Bulandshahr. After waiting for 12 days and following the five, the police officers arrested them when they gathered at Meerut on Monday to begin their journey to Mumbai.

BHIM-Aadhaar app to allow payment using fingerprint launched,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched BHIM-Aadhar pay app, that will allow people to make payments without using a smartphone. Instead, the app will enable payments through the fingerprint scanner, by authenticating the biometric details of a user with Aadhaar database. The app, which will be available for download to merchants across the country, will link your Aadhaar number and biometric fingerprint to complete a transaction. This will not only make cashless payment more prevalent but also possibly more easy and hassle-free. To enable the transactions through BHIM-Aadhar, merchants will have to purchase fingerprint scanners.With the implementation of the new system, all you will need is your fingerprint to make a payment. Using the Aadhaar number linked to your bank account, the payment for your purchase will be requested by the merchant but is finalised only when you keep your finger on the biometric machine connected to the app through the smartphone.",technology,981,60,70

Swachh Bharat campaign uses Baahubali in promotional posters,"With estimated 60 per cent of toilets built under Swachh Bharat Mission lying unused, startups have come up to the rescue of the railway ministry with innovative communication module to induce behavioural changes in people. From national icons like Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh to present-day heroes like Baahubali, the module uses these characters to urge people to stop littering and defecating in public.A pilot project has been launched by a behavioural intervention startup, Antyodaya Group at the New Delhi railway station which uses behavioural science to communicate the message. Posters and hoardings have been put up at the station appealing passengers to be like Gandhi, Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh by keeping the country clean.TOILET INFRASTRUCTURE""The Swachh Bharat Mission is mostly confined to create toilet infrastructure but little has been done to change the mindset of people towards using these facilities. As a result, the infrastructure largely remains unused. The startup is inspired by this behvioural pattern that needs to be changed,"" said Sourav Panda, the founder of the startup, adding, it uses applied and social psychology, behaviour economics and choice architecture to spread the message of cleanliness.Official sources said Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, touted as world's biggest cleanliness programme, with nearly eight per cent of the total budget reserved for the behavioural-change component, but over last three years, the focus has been on building toilet infrastructure without the proper understanding of how people's mindsets can be changed towards their usage.Sources said nearly 60 per cent of the total toilets built under the mission are not being used as also unused toilets are being converted into storage spaces and thus causing huge loss to the public.Seventy per cent of all diseases diagnosed are related to sanitation.

"Rare whale washes ashore at Mumbai beach, dies during rescue","In a rare incident along the state?s coastline, a seven-and-a-half-foot-long sperm whale washed ashore at Rajodi beach, Virar, around 3pm on Thursday.Though the state mangrove cell confirmed that it was a sperm whale, the officials are unclear whether it was a juvenile whale or a pygmy or a dwarf (subspecies). The whale weighed 60 kg. Fishermen from Rajodi said they spotted the whale close to the shoreline towards the south side of the beach and it looked injured. ?The mammal most likely hit a large rock close to the shoreline and got injured. We tried pulling it out, but it died as soon as it came close to the beach. We informed the forest department but nobody showed up at the spot,? said James Rodrigues, a fisherman and Rajodi beach resident. ?Along with seven others, we buried the animal near the spot where it had washed ashore. We have not seen a mammal like this at this beach before.?When HT contacted the forest officers from Vasai-Virar, they were unaware of the beaching incident. According to the Konkan Cetacean Research Team (KCRT), the last documented evidence of this mammal to have beached is from Goa in March 2016. ?This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state?s coastline for more than a decade. It is extremely rare and our team is going to collect tissue samples and study the mammal,? said Mihir Sule, member, KCRT. This was the 15th case of dead marine animal carcass washing ashore along Mumbai?s beaches. Between 2015 and 2017, 74 carcasses have washed ashore along the city?s coastline. Both the dwarf and the pygmy sperm whales are protected under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Owing to lack of information about the species, the mammal is not listed under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",general,1790,60,70

Philippine Prez offers Muslim self-rule to counter ISIS,"President Rodrigo Duterte offered self-rule to the Philippines? Muslim minority on Monday in an attempt to defeat Islamist militants who seized a southern city in the gravest challenge to his year-old rule.Duterte hopes the promise of autonomy will persuade Filipino Muslims to reject the Islamic State group, whose followers still control parts of Marawi after nearly two months of fighting that had left more than 500 people dead.Duterte vowed to shepherd through Congress a ?Bangsamoro Basic Law? bill jointly written and submitted to him Monday by government officials and the country?s largest Muslim guerrilla group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).?This moment is a significant step forward in our quest to end centuries of hatred, mistrust and injustice that cost and affected the lives of millions of Filipinos,? he said in a speech to MILF leaders and government officials.Both sides said that giving the mainly Catholic nation?s large and largely impoverished Islamic minority a better choice was crucial to heading off the lure of violent extremism.?These misguided people have filled the vacuum created by our failure to enact the basic law, and feed into the frustration of our people,? MILF chairman Murad Ebrahim told the same gathering, referring to the Marawi gunmen.Muslims since the 1970s had waged a decades-old insurgency that claimed more than 100,000 lives in the Mindanao region that includes Marawi.The MILF signed a peace treaty with Duterte?s predecessor Benigno Aquino in 2014 but Congress refused to pass the self-rule bill -- a key provision of the accord.Small rebel factions began pledging allegiance to the IS soon afterwards. The Marawi attack on May 23 was their first major action, forcing Duterte to impose martial rule across Mindanao.The chief government peace negotiator, Irene Santiago, said Manila expects the bill?s passage within a year.?The next 12 months are full of opportunity but also fraught with so much danger. The dangers are staring us in the face: violent extremism, the source of the crisis in Marawi,? Santiago added.An Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has been in place in parts of the south since after a rival faction, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), signed peace with Manila in 1996.However it had failed to end violence and rebellion.Santiago said both the MILF and MNLF helped to draft the new self-rule bill giving all sides optimism about its passage. Duterte is also set to decide within the week whether to extend military rule over Mindanao.The constitution limits martial rule to 60 days, a safeguard against abuses put in place after the downfall of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship.However Congress can authorise an extension.The military said there were still 60-80 gunmen holed up in about 500 Marawi houses and buildings after weeks of day and night air strikes and artillery pounding.About 300 civilians also remain trapped in the area and some of them have been taken hostage, the military said.",world,2997,55,70

285 Delhi schools told not to start nursery admissions,"The Directorate of Education (DOE) has warned of action if school on government land starts the nursery admission process from January 2 next year. The order applies to 285 schools such as Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, Vasant Valley and Apeejay. The government had on December 19 issued a circular saying it will release a separate set of guidelines and schedule for these 285 schools. The new set of rules is to make schools comply with land allotment terms. The terms state that schools running on government land will not refuse admission to residents of the ?locality?. It says ?the society shall undertake to admit 75% of the students of the neighbourhood or from the locality in which the school is located?.For the remaining 1,400 schools, the nursery admission process will begin January 2. ?It has come to the notice of the department that some of these schools have issued the admission notice to start the admission process from January 2, 2017 in violation of the directions,? said a circular from the DOE.Read: Nursery admissions: Shifting goalposts, litigation trouble for parents in DelhiThis order indicates the admission process for the 285 schools will be delayed and there will be two separate schedules for different schools. ?All the schools around my house are on government land.

Taking note of the poor response, several district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) have published advertisements in newspapers, urging farmers to avail the loan. The government has also extended the deadline to claim the money to August 31 from the earlier July 15.The delay in issuing directions to banks owing to the failure in convincing RBI is to blame for this.?There is poor response to the interim waiver scheme.

Women claim their braids being chopped off by unknown people,"The braids of three women in an outer Delhi village were chopped mysteriously by unknown persons on Sunday, leaving villagers scared and seeking superstitious remedies.The three incidents, which occurred over a period of about 12 hours on Sunday, took place in the houses where the women lived. Each of the women said the chopping of their braids happened soon after they experienced sudden unbearable headaches and fell unconscious. The braids were left behind at the spot.Though the police could neither comment confidently on the motive behind the mischief, nor trace the people behind it, they claimed that CCTV cameras had captured three men suspiciously roaming around in the village.Speaking to the media, Surender Kumar, DCP (south-west), vehemently opposed villagers? suspicion that these activities had supernatural connections. ?Witchcraft is totally ruled out. We are probing this in a scientific manner,? he said adding that theft could also be a possible motive. Villagers, however, denied any thefts in the area.According to media reports, around a dozen similar activities were reported in places such as Gurgaon, Palwal and Mewat in Haryana. However, Sunday was the first time this was reported in Delhi.The first victim was a 55-year-old woman living in Kanganheri village in outer Delhi?s Chhawla. A woman with red hair, she was returning home from her farm around 10.30 am on Sunday when she suddenly experienced a severe headache.The moment she entered her home, she locked the outermost six-feet high iron gate and jumped into a bed in the drawing room, leaving the drawing room door ajar. Her sleeping position was such that her face and gaze were away from the door.?Suddenly, I felt extreme pain in my head. I held my head and screamed for my grandchildren. But my screams were drowned in the sound of the cooler,? she told HT.When her granddaughter visited the drawing room a few minutes later, she found the woman unconscious on the floor. ?Her chopped braid was lying on the ground. We immediately informed the villagers and the police,? her son told HT. He had run out of the house to see if there was anyone, but he could not find any stranger.?No one approached me on my way back home from the farm. No one followed me into my house and no one touched me when I lay on the bed. I don?t remember anyone chopping off my hair either,? she said. Unaware of similar happenings in Haryana, the local police initially suspected the role of one of her relatives. But even as the villagers were discussing this unusual activity, a similar case happened in another house in the village with a population of over 5,000.This time it was a 45-year-old woman who had been dropped off at her home by her son around 8 pm. She had just got off the bike when she reported headache. Her son took her to bed and left. Within minutes, she experienced a similar pain and fell unconscious. When she woke up, she found her reddish braid chopped off. She too had not seen the culprit. By 11.30 pm, a 50-year-old woman living at the other end of the village lost her whitish braid. She had to be taken to a hospital before she regained consciousness. The same pattern in all three cases has prompted police to suspect that the culprits intoxicated the women.?There were also thefts at one or two of these women?s homes,? the DCP said. The villagers, however, rejected the police?s claims of intoxication or thefts. A case of poisoning, outraging the modesty of a woman, theft and under arms act has been registered at Chhawla police station.",general,3546,60,70
"Cyber Hub, Leela Hotel change entries to counter liquor ban","To circumvent the 500-metre liquor ban on pubs, bars and restaurants, the developers in Gurgaon are changing the entrance to their properties; making motorable distance more than 500 metres and moving these establishments out of the purview of the Supreme Court?order. This is in violation of the sanctioned plans and maps approved by the department of town and country planning. However, insiders say that the developers are ready to take the risk as there is no other way for them to avoid the ban. The excise department, meanwhile, said the process to measure the motorable distance of the bars and pubs will begin on Wednesday. At the Ambience Mall, the developer has closed the entrance to the Leela Ambience Hotel and visitors will now have to drive around the residential complex before entering the hotel. This has also hit the entry to the Ambience Lagoon apartments and invited the ire of the residents. ?We have complained to the police and DTCP officials but nothing has been done. Fast moving luxury cars and commercial traffic is now moving in front of our complex. Children and elders can?t go out on the road,? said Sanjay Lal, member of the RWA executive committee. Liquor sales at bars and pubs in Cyber Hub and Ambience mall are major crowd pullers and generate huge revenue for these properties. The bar/pub owners in Sector 29 also want HUDA to block entry to one of the roads so that the motorable distance can be increased. ?We have invested crores in setting up these facilities. The government should now help us,? said a bar owner, preferring anonymity. Similarly, the entrance to Cyber Hub near Rapid Metro station next to Shankar Chowk has been moved to ensure that the motorable distance is more than a kilometre from NH8. More than 150 bars and pubs in Gurgaon have been hit by the Supreme Court?s ban on liquor sale within 500 metres of state and national highways.

Resolving regulatory probe of NSE top priority: CEO Limaye,"The new chief executive of India?s embattled National Stock Exchange (NSE) said on Monday his immediate priority was to resolve a regulatory investigation facing the country?s largest bourse and improve relations with stakeholders.Vikram Limaye took over the NSE on Monday, with the exchange facing a probe from market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) about whether company employees provided unfair access to co-location servers to select brokers.Co-location servers are placed at the site of exchanges to speed up algorithmic trading.The probe has delayed a much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of the NSE that bankers had said could raise up to $1 billion.Limaye, a 50-year-old finance industry veteran who was previously CEO of infrastructure lender IDFC Ltd, also has to face regulatory scrutiny after NSE suffered a technological glitch that caused widespread disruptions in trading last week.?The immediate priorities for me are to resolve the co-location issue with SEBI,? Limaye told Reuters in an interview on Monday. ?Then, we need to obviously improve various stakeholder relationships whether it?s with SEBI, government, clients, media, employees,? he added. Limaye said the NSE was in talks with SEBI to settle the issue of unfair access to brokers. ?That we believe will be the fastest way to resolve this,? Limaye said. ?We will have to file an official application for consent in order to start that process.? Sources told Reuters last month that the NSE was in talks with the market regulator to settle the issue, in an effort to move ahead with its listing, and accept a penalty. SEBI has not said whether it would be open to a settlement.Limaye said he had ?no visibility? on when the exchange could go public, as the regulatory probe had to be resolved first.He said he would also focus on better communication to fix the bourse?s image. ?Unfortunately, what we haven?t done a good job (at), historically, is communicating,? he said. ?So, I firmly believe even the co-location issue could have been managed a lot better.?A number of high-profile executives have left the NSE, including co-founders and former CEOs Chitra Ramkrishna and Ravi Narain.Limaye is the first chief executive to come from outside the exchange?s founding team since it was set up in 1992.",business,2321,58,70
Malaika slams user who trolled her for 'divorcing rich man',"From her special numbers to TV?appearances, Bollywood actor Malaika Arora Khan has managed to carve her own identity. The actor, who made her debut in the Hindi film industry with the blockbuster debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Chaiyya Chaiyya from Dil Se (1998), is still remembered for the song. However, for trolls, she is a woman first and what matters right now is that she divorced a ?rich man?. On Wednesday, Malaika Arora shared a gorgeous picture of herself on Instagram and a follower decided to troll her for using her ?alumni? (read alimony) money to wear ?short clothes and going to gym or salon?. Little did he/she know that the Munni Badnam star would reply with the perfect comeback. Take a look at the interaction: Super excited to be affiliated with Khanna Jewellers @khannajewellerskj as their brand ambassador. Crafted to perfection, their stunning statement jewellery is a must have for every jewellery lover. #khannajewellers...#maksquad?? #hair @hairbypriyanka #stylist @manekaharisinghani #manager @ektakauroberoi #mua? @subbu28 #photographer @prasdnaik A post shared by Malaika Arora Khan (@malaikaarorakhanofficial) on Aug 2, 2017 at 6:20am PDT Then, Malaika decided to reply: The entire conversation only proves that no matter if a woman is successful, she will be attacked the moment she decides to step out of bounds the society decided for her. Apart from being a successful woman who lives life on her own terms, Malaika has literally played all the roles traditionally prescribed for a woman - she married quite early, had a son and raised him and was always around with the ?khandan?. But then, she got divorced and alimony is the taunt being thrown at her. The details of the alimony are only known to Malaika, her husband Arbaaz Khan and perhaps the family. The couple has handled the divorce with the utmost dignity. But we can vouch for the fact that she did not need an alimony to buy clothes (short or not, her choice), go on vacations and enjoy her life. If anything, she is as successful, if not more, than her ex-husband.What happened between Arbaaz and Malaika is their personal concern. But to claim that Malaika married and then divorced Arbaaz for money doesn?t hold water. For those who do not agree, please get a course in feminism and for others, here?s a playlist of some of her most popular songs. Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,2382,60,70

None of mobile payment apps in India fully secure: Qualcomm,"While government is pushing for digital payments through mobile phones, chipset maker Qualcomm said that wallets and mobile banking applications in India are not using hardware level security which can make online transactions more secure.

Users use fingerprint which might be captured ... in India that is the case for most of all digital wallets and mobile banking apps,"" Qualcomm Senior Director Product Management Sy Choudhury told reporters here. He said that even most famous digital payment application in India is not using hardware level security. ""Reason we are saying that none of them is using it because we work with OEMs (original equipment makers),"" Choudhury said.

He said that Qualcomm is now approaching digital payments companies for using secure environment for processing payments on mobile phone. ""We are providing secure execution environment in the chipsets. This layer separates transactions on mobile phone from operating system. This checks any malware from effecting transactions,"" Choudhury said. He said that Qualcomm is also coming up with new feature in its mobile chipsets from 2017 that verify user with payment gateway using unique features like device id, phone manufacturer signature, Android version in the phone, root kit of operating system, location and time, which will be nearly impossible to duplicate. ""Device attestation feature will start shipping in 2017. For end users it should be available by end of 2017,"" Choudhury said.",general,2041,59,70

Quake bigger than Nepal 2015 may hit North India soon: Study,"A 5.8 magnitude earthquake rattled Uttarakhand on Monday (February 6) evening sending tremors all across north India, including Delhi and its adjoining areas, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. Luckily, no damage to life or property was reported from Uttarakhand or other parts of north India rattled by the quake epicentered 31km below the earth surface in Pipalkoti near Rudraprayag.Uttarakhand and the northern Himalayan region have witnessed several high and medium intensity tremors in the recent past. Nepal was devastated by a magnitude 7.9 quake on April 25, 2015. However, experts have warned of a catastrophic earthquake in north India in near future. Several reports based on study of movement of tectonic plates have pointed out that a catastrophic earthquake could hit Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of north India in years to come.Scientists of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) said that the big one could come sooner than expected. Dr Sushil Kumar, senior scientist at WIHG, explained the Indian Plate is moving towards the Eurasian Plate at the speed of 45 mm/year causing immense pressure under the earth surface in the region, a report in Jagran said.The Himalayan region has had four major earthquakes in the past 150 years. According to geologists, the regions between Kangra and Nepal-Bihar did not experience any earthquake for a long time till the April 25, 2015 earthquake. The region was the ""maximum probable zone"" for an earthquake. The Himalayas had experienced three great quakes during the past century - Nepal-Bihar (1934), upper Assam (in 1950) and Kangra, Himachal Pradesh (1905).HOW THE HIMALAYAN RANGE WAS CREATEDThe earth's landmasses ride like gigantic rafts on ""plates"", or sections of the earth's outermost layer, the crust. These plates frequently slip and slide, causing earthquakes. We don't feel the small ones. The big ones, literally, shake us up.The Himalayas and north India are on particularly shaky ground. Sometime in the geological past, before humans, India broke off from an ancient supercontinent called Gondwana, a name still used for what is now Chhattisgarh.The Indian plate skewed north, displaced an ancient sea, travelled more than 2,000 km - the fastest a plate has ever moved - and slammed into the Eurasian plate, creating the Himalayas.About 60 per cent of India is vulnerable to earthquakes caused by the great, northward grind of the Indian subcontinental landmass.according to geologists, the 1950 Assam earthquake may have geologically set the stage for a really big one in the Himalayas. Now that 65 years have passed, it may be time for a big one.(With inputs from IANS)",general,2693,60,70

"Mark Zuckerberg is why I?m walking, says Sheryl Sandberg","Sheryl Sandberg has credited Mark Zuckerberg with saving her life after the sudden death of her husband, saying the Facebook co-founder and his wife, Priscilla, were ?why I?m walking?.In an interview with the Guardian, Facebook?s chief operating officer spoke candidly about dealing with the loss of her husband, Dave Goldberg, who died of a heart attack in 2015 when they were in Mexico for the weekend.?Mark is why I?m walking,? she said. ?Most of what [he and Priscilla] did is not even in the book, because they did so much. When I felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry, I would grab him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me and be like, ?We?re going to get through this and we want to get through it with you?. He did it over and over.?Sandberg?s latest book, Option B, written with psychologist Adam Grant, explores her grief at the loss of Goldberg and acts as a manual for how to build resilience and achieve ?post-traumatic growth?. She wrote the book after posting a highly personal account of her first month as a widow on Facebook. The post attracted a huge outpouring of support and more than 74,000 comments to date. ?After that, I didn?t feel so alone,? she said.Sandberg described how her self-confidence had been shattered after the death of her husband, and that she had needed building up by colleagues including Zuckerberg. She described panicking to him about getting something wrong, and feeling better when he replied: ?Really? I thought you made a good point in that meeting and helped us make a better decision.? The executive, who started dating her old friend and tech billionaire Bobby Kotick 10 months after the death of her husband, also spoke about her anger towards people who judge widows who date again.One Facebook user called her a ?garbage whore?, while another said she was ?one classy lady? for ?already sharing fluids with a nice guy?. ?I?m hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date [after the loss of a partner], particularly women, because women get judged more harshly,? she said. ?Men date sooner, men date more, and women get judged more. And, you know, obviously that?s super unfair.?She added: ?I think I?m helping people remember that dating, for those that want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it?s option B. If I could, I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I just had it taken away from me.?In the book ? for which she studied the research of behavioural scientists, neurologists and psychologists for tips on how to build resilience ? Sandberg offers practical methods for dealing with grief. These include writing down three joyful experiences and three things done well every day.The author of Lean-In admitted becoming more distanced from friends after the loss of her partner. Asked if she had been let down by loved ones, she replied: ?I don?t know anyone who?s been through this who hasn?t had friends who disappointed them. I think we all go through that.?But the process of dealing with the loss of her husband and best friend had given her life a deeper meaning, and more perspective on life?s difficulties, she said. ?I would definitely choose to be before, so I could get Dave back. I?d give up all the growth. But the deeper sense of meaning, gratitude, purpose ? those things are wonderful things.?Read the full interview and an exclusive extract from Option B in Weekend magazine",technology,3428,56,70

MNS workers attack Zara outlet for selling Pakistani clothes,"After staying out of headlines for a long a time, Raj Thackeray's party did what it knows best. Citing Pakistan's decision to sentence Kulbhushan Jadhav to death, Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Tuesday stormed into fashion brand Zara's showroom in Lower Parel and threw away clothes bearing Made in Pakistan tags.

IAF to induct first indigenously developed 'eye in the sky',"This news couldn't have come at a better time than this. On February 14, the day Aero India 2017 begins, the IAF will be the proud owner of its very own indigenous all-weather airborne early warning and control system popularly known as the AEW&C. This aerial platform is meant to be a force multiplier that will guide the IAF's fighter aircraft during combat. It will have the capability to detect incoming fighters, cruise missiles and even drones from both Pakistan and China.For Dr. Christopher, Chairman, DRDO it will be a fine day indeed. He was earlier the Programme Director (airborne early warning and control system) and Director, Centre for Air-Borne Systems in the DRDO before being elevated to the topmost post. Speaking exclusively to India Today, he said that his association with the early warning system programme goes back to 1985 when it all started. He also had a narrow escape having flown on the same test aircraft as a flight engineer that crashed in January 1999. 'I flew on that same test aircraft, the previous sortie, the last but one sortie before it crashed,' he told India Today.The indigenous AEW&C system has been developed by Bengaluru based CABS and integrated onto a Brazilian built Embraer-145 aircraft. It is equipped with a 240-degree coverage radar and can detect, identify and classify threats in the surveillance area and also act as a Command and Control Centre to support Air Defence operations.Dr. CP Ramanarayanan, Director General - Aeronautical Systems (Aero) participated in the final trials of the AEW&C. 'I was onboard this flight in Jodhpur and it was so heartening to see all the functional performance requirements were met meticulously,' he says. According to him the users (IAF) observed that this was such a trial they have never undergone. So while the second AEW&C will be handed over to the IAF in a few months time, the third which was initially to be with CABS, will also be handed over to the IAF.LOTS OF CATCHING UP TO DOChina today has more than 20 AWACS and Pakistan has 8 AWACS, India on the other hand has just this one AEW&C and 3 Phalcon systems.

UK school offers 'uniform hijabs' for Muslim pupils,"By Aditi Khanna London, Jun 28 (PTI) A secondary school in north-west England has become the first in the UK to offer hijabs or headscarves worn by Muslims as part of the uniform for pupils. Sir John Thursby Community College in Burnley, Lancashire, reacted to concerns that some hijabs were being worn incorrectly by introducing a uniform version. However, the move has come under fire from some Muslim parents and pupils, who feel the uniform hijabs are uncomfortable and not modest enough. They have launched an online petition, signed by 150 people, protesting against the lack of consultation over the new uniformed hijab. ""Unfortunately, there was very little consultation by parents or the girls attending the school. Consequently, a scarf designed by the school has been created. It is very tight and in some cases too short as some of the girls have long hair and so it defeats the object to wear it,"" the petition reads. It also questions the ""real agenda"" behind the move and if it is to ""put girls off"" wearing a headscarf. Headmaster David Burton has written to parents to defend the policy and dismiss suggestions that the school is against headscarves as untrue. ""We are sorry that there have been suggestions that the school is against headscarves. This is not true.

The Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals, has asked mandals to speak to MPs and MLAs in their constituencies to push the Centre to abolish silence zones, as an amendment to the noise rules. BSGSS? decision comes a day after HT reported the state asked the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to remove the concept of silence zones from the Noise Pollution (Control and Regulation) Rules, 2000, ahead of this year?s festivals.Silence zones are areas within a 100m radius of hospitals, courts, educational or religious institutions where noise levels must not exceed 45 decibels (dB) and 40dB during the day and night. There are 1,537 silence zones in the city.BSGSS members told HT they welcomed the state government?s move and that they will ensure this year?s festivals don?t have as many restrictions as those in previous years. ?We are happy CM Fadnavis kept his promise to relax noise norms for Ganeshotsav. We are not against anti-noise campaigners; we just want to celebrate the festival with all the fervour it deserves,? said Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS. ?These rules affect our daily aarti (prayers),? he said. Dahibhavkar said Ganesh mandals in the state were told to reach out MPs and MLAs as the Centre needs to be ?pressurised for the amendment to happen?. ?If the silence zone rule is not abolished, we will ask the state government to do away the zones through a notification, for the 10 days of the festival,? said Dahibhavkar. Noise rules have been blatantly violated in Mumbai over the years. Last year, noise levels during Ganpati reached 116.4 dB. In 2015, noise levels reached 123.7 dB (as loud as a thunderclap).

The illegal weapons are then shaped by the manufacturers with the help of heat generated in a furnace.There have been several instances wherein the police have nabbed arms suppliers in Ghaziabad.In April, the police arrested a man who was carrying 12 pistols and 11 magazines, and had come to Ghaziabad from Muzaffarnagar to deliver weapons.In January, the Ghaziabad police arrested two persons from Shatabdipuram and recovered three illegal pistols and 600 semi-built magazines (used to store cartridges in weapons) from their possession.?Ilyas has also been to jail earlier in connection with supplying and manufacturing arms. We suspect that the accused was on his way to meet Mobin in Pasonda and the purchaser was to be identified later on. Our teams have launched a search for Mobin, who is presently absconding,?

RSS launches 'no Chinese Rakhi' campaign in UP,"The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is likely to step up its campaign against Chinese goods in the run up to the Hindu campaign against the Hindu festival Rakshabandhan on August 7 by encouraging traders to not sell Chinese-made Rakhis.Volunteers of the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), the RSS Muslim wing, burnt Chinese goods in Lucknow. Whatsapp messages? like ?Wear an Indian Rakhi if you care about your country? have started being circulated in the city.Raksha Bandhan is among the six major festivals that the Sangh celebrates and the campaign comes amid an increasingly bitter New Delhi-Beijing standoff over Doklam, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan. This, Sangh leaders say, has prompted them to think of ways to weaken the Chinese financially.?This time we are going to encourage both traders and buyers not to sell Chinese Rakhi?we want to make the people aware of the sinister designs of the dragon and how by cooperating with us they can help deflate the Chinese ambitions,? said RSS pracharak Mahirajdhwaj Singh, who is associated with the MRM. The RSS has previously campaigned against Chinese crackers during Diwali and its chief, Mohan Bhagwat, called for a boycott of Chinese goods earlier this year.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an RSS affiliate floated to promote Indian products, will follow up the initiative with a two-day meeting in Gonda from July 29. Part of the campaign includes door-to-door contacts, making people aware of how the Chinese are allying with Pakistan to create disturbances in India. Sangh volunteers at the Gonda meeting will discuss ways to create awareness among people to boycott Chinese products. Bhola Nath, who is associated with the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, told HT that a massive rally would be organised in Delhi?s Ramlila grounds in October. During the rally, the Modi government will be urged to opt out of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ?China is cunningly using the WTO to flood the Indian market with cheap goods. There are larger concerns too. Several Chinese telecommunication companies, a few of which have earned huge profits, make the country?s mobile communications network vulnerable,? he said.Read more| Sikkim standoff: Don?t buy Made in China stationery, Mumbai schools tell studentsPrashant Bhatia, convener of Laghu Udyog Bharti, another RSS affiliate working to promote small and medium scale industries, has also joined the ?no Chinese product? campaign.

Russia seeks India's EVM technology for 2018 polls: Report,"Russia is hoping to embrace India's EVM technology for its upcoming presidential election, even as Indian politicians themselves continue to debate their efficiency.Russia hopes to learn from ""India's experience"" of conducting polls through EVMs, ahead of the 2018 presidential election, according to a report in The Economic Times.The report says, Nikolai Levichev, Deputy Chairman of the Russia's Election Commission, visited Uttarakhand this year during February's Assembly polls to observe and understand the process of voting through EVMs. He also monitored elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Manipur and Goa and was reportedly impressed with the EVM system as it reduced the role of people in the poll process.Levichev also held ""wide-ranging consultations"" with senior officials in Delhi to learn more about EVM technology and understand its best practices.Russia's interest in EVMs comes at a time when India's Opposition leaders have expressed grave concerns regarding EVM tampering.In a press conference held just yesterday, Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal had alleged tampering on a ""massive scale"" in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind. ""We challenge the Election Commission to make the EVM available to us for 72 hours. We will read the code and rewrite it too,"" Kejriwal said.Alleged EVM tampering has also remained a hug issue in Parliament, with various Opposition leaders disrupting proceedings to protest the issue.In light of tampering allegations, the Election Commission also decided to replace over 9 lakh EVM machines with advanced M3 machines, ahead of the 2019 general elections. These machines will become inoperable the moment someone attempts to tamper with them.Also read: Many countries have banned EVMs since they can rig elections Meanwhile, in a move to return the favour, Russia will assist India in developing a ""state-of-the-art tabulation system"" for counting of votes. This system is also expected to help Indian officials in ""obtaining faster region-wise and group-wise polling patterns.""The 2018 presidential elections -- in which Vladimir Putin will seek re-election -- will be a massive process for Russia, which is why the country's election commission hoping to ensure it goes smoothly with the help of EVM technology.",politics,2253,58,70
Called Kangana and apologised: Saif on nepotism act at IIFA,"In an open letter published Friday, Saif Ali Khan, in response to the backlash he faced after jokingly taking a dig at Kangana Ranaut, wrote that he had ?apologised? to her, and he doesn?t ?owe anybody else an explanation. The issue is over.?Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan (R) and director/producer Karan Johar perform on stage during the IIFA Awards of the 18th International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Festival at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (AFP) In the letter, published on DNA, Saif goes on to say that the comments he made on nepotism with Karan Johar and Varan Dhawan were a joke. ?It?s not something that I wrote or something I believe in. It was a joke on ourselves, between Varun (Dhawan), Karan (Johar) and me. It was not supposed to be a big deal, but I realised at some point, that it might have offended Kangana (Ranaut). I called her and apologised personally. That should be the end of it. Everybody needs to take a chill pill and back off,? he wrote.But he is aware of the controversy his comments stirred up. Nepotism has always been a hot topic in Bollywood, and when three industry bigwigs yelled ?nepotism rocks? in front of thousands of fans at the 2017 IIFA Awards, they were slammed in the press. Saif wrote about the negative stories published about the issue. ?What I can?t seem to understand are some of the media reactions to this. While most people have been sensible, three reporters from the websites BollywoodLife, The Quint and Elle India, made a point of saying that all I did was use big words like eugenics and genetics,? he wrote, referring to a comment he made about how it is possible that members of the Kapoor family join the film business because it is in their genes.Actors Varun Dhawan, Saif Ali Khan and filmmaker Karan Johar during the press conference of 18th International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards in Mumbai. (IANS) He then proceeded to attack the journalist who wrote the article in Elle. ?As for the girl from Elle: I?m sorry you found words like eugenics in a conversation about nepotism misplaced. Perhaps if you got your head out of the hemline of the actress of the month and read a book, your vocabulary might improve.?The ?flagbearer of nepotism,? he said, making a reference to the words Kangana used to describe Karan Johar on an episode of his talk show on which Saif was present, ?is the media.??Nepotism is probably least prevalent in the movie industry and rampant in politics and business,? he wrote, speculating that perhaps what Kangana means when she accuses the industry of nepotism, ?is that people from Dharma or Yashraj are against people like her, who have come up the hard way without their support and that they only support their own people.??Whether that is true or not I have no idea and it?s none of my business,? he conceded.?Nepotism cannot work in the film industry because it is a democracy. The film industry is the most fair line of work. So yes, maybe I got a chance because of my mother, but that is more genetics than nepotism. It?s a genetic investment that the producer was making,? he wrote.Saif also said that ?for every star kid, there are many guys and girls from total non-filmi backgrounds. Take Shah Rukh Khan, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit-Nene, Jackie Shroff.??It?s the audience that makes a film a hit,? he wrote, and ?not the family members.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,3423,59,70

Rape-accused kills self after order to drink victim's urine,"A 25-year-old post-graduate youth, who felt humiliated by a panchayat diktat asking him to drink a girl?s urine for allegedly raping her, claimed his life, police said.The incident happened over a week ago in a remote village of Targain in Budhal tehsil of Rajouri district, 150 km northwest of Jammu.The deceased has been identified as Fazal Hussain, son of Mohammed Abdullah.Before committing suicide by jumping into Samar Sar lake, near Targain village, Hussain had recorded an audio clip on a mobile phone wherein he stated that he never raped the girl and felt humiliated by the panchayat?s diktat.SSP Rajouri, Yougal Manhas told HT over phone that in the next two to three days, the police will ascertain the facts and take action accordingly.Manhas said the mobile phone belonged to one of Hussain?s relative, probably his cousin.?He had stated in the clip that he was asked by the panchayat to drink girl?s urine and he also claimed that he never raped the girl,? said the SSP.He, however, informed that none of the two families ever approached police.?They didn?t report the matter to police and appeared before village panchayat,? he added.The officer said that the Hussain?s body was recovered from the lake on Sunday after it was spotted floating by some shepherds in the upper reaches of Budhal.Another police officer from Budhal said that the parents of the girl from the same Targain village had approached the panchayat with a complaint of rape against the accused.?The girl?s family had sought justice and the panchayat came up with such a weird punishment,? he said.Initial investigations revealed that the panchayat had asked Hussain?s family to compensate the girl?s family with money.?But Fazal Hussain refused to pay.

Ganga tunnel of East West Metro is 1st of its kind: Minister,"Kolkata, Apr 17 (PTI) The underwater tunnel of East-West Metro Corridor Project here, built below the Ganga river bed, is the first of its kind in the country, said Union Minister Babul Supriyo today after going into the tunnel. ""This is the first such project in the country. Building a tunnel under the river had never taken place elsewhere in India. Further being built under Ganga, it has an emotional value as well,"" Supriyo, who went inside the tunnel between slab numbers 820 and 840, said. He has been asked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to personally supervise the work, said Supriyo while interacting with the officials of Afcons-Transtonnelstroy of South Africa, the agency to build the tunnel between Howrah Maidan and the proposed Mahakaran metro station near Writers Buildings here. Supriyo also collected soil from the place and kept it in two utensils - one for gifting to the prime minister and another for himself as a memento. The entire stretch of tunnel from Howrah Maidan to the Ganga bank in the city will be 1.7 km, of which a significant part will be on the surface. ""Basically, we reached almost the bottom of the Ganga and spent a considerable time (there). It was an exhilarating experience. I salute the engineers and the workers for the heroic work,"" Supriyo, the Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises said. Asked about the safety of the project, he said ""Let me allay any apprehension about the safety. We did not feel uncomfortable inside though we were 32 m below the river water - that is the sea level."" He said the tunnel went under buildings like Howrah Station but there were no threat to them as the latest technology had been used. The tunnel boring machine (TBM), used in the excavation work, will now go beyond the slab number 840 to dig up earth under the river bed and finally reach the east bank - that is the city. Expressing hope that the Howrah Maidan-Esplanade part of Phase II of the project, which would connect Howrah Maidan to Sealdah) will not miss the deadline, Supriyo said ""We expect to clear the logjam in the wake of the existing rule that infrastructure projects would not come up within 100 m of the heritage buildings."" ""There are three heritage constructions - two synagogues and the Currency Building within 30 m of the proposed tunnel. But IIT-Kharagpur in a feasibility study said the tunnel work and metro movement would not cause any damage to the structures."" ""We are not setting up a time-frame and the Union cabinet is preparing a note to exempt the Metro work. Lets hope for the best,"" he said. The entire second phase of the East West Project, with 100 per cent funding by the Centre, had been facilitated by the West Bengal government with intervention by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet colleagues to clear settlements. Phase 1 of the East-West Metro Corridor Project, he said, is expected to be completed on time and thanked Banerjee for removing encroachments along the route. ""During my chance meeting with the West Bengal CM in 2015 which the media had christened as Jhalmuri diplomacy, I had broached the topic of encroachment and with the intervention of TMC leaders it was resolved. ""The encroachers will be relocated in a new building in the area,"" he said.",general,3288,60,70
Stop doping or the sport dies: Usain Bolt to fellow athletes,"Usain Bolt has issued a stark warning to his fellow athletes that they must stop doping otherwise track and field will die. The triple Olympic 100m and 200m champion insisted that the sport was on the mend following the staggering revelations of state-sponsored doping in Russia but conceded more needed to be done to tackle the scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.?I don?t think it gets any worse than that,? he said, referring to the problems in Russia which he agreed had left the sport at rock bottom. ?But it?s on its way back up now. Hopefully, athletes will see what?s going on and understand that if they don?t stop what they?re doing the sport will die. And hopefully they will understand what the sport is going through and what they need to do as athletes to help it move forward.?But Bolt, who will hang up his spikes after the world championships in London which start on Friday, said he was still optimistic that these perennial problems could be tackled. ?You can?t be happy about doping at all, it?s not good for the sport,? he added. ?But over the years we?re doing a better job, it?s getting clean and we?re catching up to a lot of athletes. There?s an understanding that, listen, if you cheat you will get caught. Over time the sport will get better.?I said a couple of years ago it had to get really bad, when there?s nowhere else to go but up. The only way track and field has left to go is up.?Bolt has raced only three times this season, and last month appeared to be struggling with a back injury, but he insisted he was still the man to beat in the 100m, the qualifying rounds for which start on Friday. ?For some reason I am the underdog,? he said. ?That is what my team keep telling me so I have to prove myself once more. But I am confident in my abilities, always. When I go out there I am fully confident and ready to go ? 100%.?The last 100m race I ran was a 9.95sec which shows I am going in the right direction. It is all about who can keep their nerves. I have been here many times and I know I am ready. It is go time.?Bolt, who turns 31 later this month, also gave an emphatic answer when asked how he would feel on Saturday night after the 100m final. ?Unbeatable,? he said. ?Usain Bolt has retired unbeatable over that event. For me that will be the biggest headline. Unbeatable and unstoppable.?The Jamaican also insisted that he had been provided with extra motivation to win yet another world title following the tragic death of his close friend Germaine Mason, the Olympic silver medal winning high jumper, in a road accident in April.?It was a rough time,? he said. ?I have never had someone who passed away so close to me. I didn?t train for three weeks. My coach gave me my space, he gave me my time to get over it. But at some point the close net of people I was with said: ?Listen to us, Usain, I know it is hard but you need to get back training because Germaine would have wanted it ? he was looking forward to coming to your last race and seeing you compete and finishing off your legacy.??That really helped me get going again.

The villagers, not happy with the Ordinance that was cleared by Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao on Saturday, are demanding a more permanent solution to the issue. The Ordinance allowing jallikattu will stay in effect for only six months. CM Panneerselvam has promised that the upcoming Tamil Nadu assembly session will pass a new law that will allow jallikattu to be held permanently without any hindrance.'WON'T ALLOW CM TO ENTER'On Saturday, protesters prevented the Madurai district collector and SP from entering the village. The two officials had reached Alanganallur to make arrangements for today's inauguration. The locals say they won't hold jallikattu today and have even vowed not to let Chief Minister Panneerselvam enter their village today. 'We cannot protest like this every time we want to hold jallikattu which is why we are asking for a permanent solution,' is the common refrain among the locals. A neighbouring village, Avaniapuram, also plans to boycott today's jallikattu celebrations with the locals issuing calls for citizens of the Madurai district to join them in their continuing protests.Also read: Jallikattu: After AR Rahman, music maestro Ilayaraja also extends supportSTATE GEARS UP FOR JALLIKATTU Tamil Nadu has seen nearly a week of massive, state-wide protests over demands that jallikattu, banned by the Supreme Court in 2014, be legalised. Several celebrities and personalities came out in support of the protesters and Chennai particularly captured the imagination of the country after protesters spent multiple days and nights at the Marina beach. The impasse finally seemed to have neared an end with Governor Rao's go-ahead for the jallikattu ordinance paving the way to hold the centuries-old bull-taming sport. Following this, the Tamil Nadu state machinery moved quickly to announce that CM Panneerselvam will inaugurate jallikattu in Alanganallur on Sunday at 10 am. Other state ministers are expected to inaugurate the sport in their respective districts at 11 am.",general,2292,56,70
Govt hasn't waived a single paisa of any industrialist: FM,"Lucknow, Feb 14 (PTI) The NDA government has ""not waived even a single paisa"" of any industrialist and Rahul Gandhi is levelling ""false allegations"" in this regard, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley asserted today. ""Rahul Gandhi, in his rallies, has been alleging that the Central government has waived over Rs one lakh crore loan of 50 top industrial houses in the country, but his statement is totally wrong,"" Jaitely told newspersons here. ""The Narendra Modi government has not waived even a single paisa of any industrialist till now... Rahul might not be having full information... ""Actually, he is levelling false allegations against the previous UPA government as most of the non-performing assets today belong to those who had been given loans by the Congress-led government,"" he claimed. To another question, Jaitley said, ""Demonetisation has nothing to do with Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections... it is a part of the governments programme to clean up both economic and political systems."" On the SP-led Uttar Pradesh governments allegation of lack of enough Central help, he said, ""This is totally wrong."" ""Under the constitutional provisions, the Centre cannot cut even a single rupee in allocation to the state... 42 per cent of the revenue collected by the Central government belongs to the state and there is no scope of cutting even a single rupee,"" he said. Jaitley claimed since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the wave in favour of BJP in Uttar Pradesh has remained intact, and expressed confidence that his party will gain majority very easily. Terming the SP-Congress alliance as ""opportunist"", he said Samajwadi Party ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia had given a call of Congress hatao, desh bachao but that anti-Congress movement has been hit in Uttar Pradesh with SP tying up with that party.",general,1811,58,70
"Declare Hurriyat a terror group, says General VK Singh","In an extremely hard hitting interview to India Today, Union Minister of State for External Affairs, General VK Singh has demanded that the Hurriyat Conference be declared a terrorist organisation and separatist leaders like Naeem Khan and Bitta Karate be immediately jailed under the Public Safety Act of Jammu and Kashmir. WATCH VIDEOGeneral Singh has also demanded that people like Syed Ali Shah Geelani should not be allowed to live in relative comfort while under house arrest.Instead, Singh wants that the Hurriyat leaders be locked up in central prisons on terrorism charges. He congratulated the India Today Group for Hurriyat Truth Tapes and described the special investigation as the most compelling evidence ever gathered against the 'terrorists' in the Hurriyat because the Hurriyat leaders have themselves admitted that they are paid by Pakistan to burn schools in Kashmir.General Singh said the onus is now on the Mehbooba Mufti government to commence immediate and unprecedented clampdown on the Hurriyat Conference leaders who only care about the well being of their own families and are nothing but stooges of Pakistan.India Today aired a special investigative report where Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan was caught on camera admitting that Pakistan is funding violence in the Kashmir Valley.Several top Kashmiri separatists were also caught on camera confessing to receiving funds from across the border.Some of them also admitted they raised money domestically, pledging to repeat the deadly events of 2016 if financed again. The stunning probe that rips apart the devious designs of anti-India forces in Kashmir includes Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan, Tehreek-E-Hurriyat's leader Gazi Javed Baba, and JKLF chairman Farooq Ahmed Dar (Bitta Karate).The investigation traces the terror funding trail. Hurriyat leader Naeem Khan stealthily travels down to Delhi to meet India Today reporters, who posed as potential funders.The investigation revealed that Pakistan's agents who are trying to destabilise Kashmir through street violence are hidden in Delhi.The expose was hailed not only by the government and the BJP but also by the Congress.Also read:India Today impact: NIA roped in to probe Pakistan link in Hurriyat tapes, says Kashmir minister Hurriyat hypocrisy: How children of separatist leaders lead a life of luxury",general,2403,54,70
Swaraj seeks report on woman 'strip-searched' at airport,"After an Indian woman was allegedly strip-searched at Frankfurt airport, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has sought a report from the Indian consul general concerned.""Raveesh - Plz send me a report on this. @CGIFrankfurt (sic),"" Swaraj tweeted to Indian consul general in Frankfurt Raveesh Kumar. A 30-year-old Indian woman, who was on her way to Iceland from Bengaluru, was asked to strip by security officers at the Frankfurt airport in Germany this week.It was only after the woman insisted that her husband, a native of Iceland, walk into the room that the security officials backed out. ""Are brown people not suspicious if we have European partners or co-travellers?"" she wrote in an angry post on Facebook, describing her incident of March 29.""I would like to know if it is a regular protocol to ask passengers to remove their clothing, be it their underwear, as part of 'random security checks'.""Shruthi Basapa had undergone an abdominal surgery two weeks ago. Shruthi passed the full body scan, yet she was willing to go through a pat-down check. She requested them to be gentle since she had had a surgery. Even though she provided medical reports of her recent surgery, they refused to let her go. ""We were travelling to Iceland from India via Frankfurt with our 4-year-old daughter when I was asked to move aside for this 'random check', no explanations offered. I was taken into a room and was asked to lift my dress/ take it off so that I could be checked to make sure I wasn't 'carrying anything under my clothes'"", she wrote in her Facebook post.Shruthi alleges it was a case of racial profiling.This is not the first time something like this happened with her. But the treatment meted out to her this time was shockingly unbearable. Reacting to Shruthi's Facebook post, the Facebook account of Frankfurt airport said that such a practice wasn't part of the standard protocol, according to an NDTV report. ""I am shocked to hear that. Of course it is not the standard protocol reserved for anyone. We would appreciate your detailed feedback. What happened exactly? When and where was it?"" the Frankfurt Airport Team asked.""I hate to play the race card here, but I was the only person pulled aside and peeking at my husband instantly changed the woman's mind about the strip search that was now a regular pat-down.

BJP calls for strike in Kerala over RSS worker's killing,"Several parts of Kerala were tense on Sunday where the BJP has called a shutdown to protest against the killing of a Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) worker, who was allegedly stabbed by CPI(M) workers a day earlier.E Rajesh, 34, was stabbed 40 times and his left hand chopped off by a group of men at around 9pm on Saturday.

CAG slams govt over poor execution of crop insurance schemes,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on Friday slammed the government for poor implementation of crop insurance schemes in 2011-16, saying the funds were released to private insurers without verification.Both the central and state government had incurred an expenditure of Rs 32,606.65 crore towards payment of premium subsidy and claim liabilities in the said period. This amount was channelised via state-owned Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) to private companies, it said in its latest report.The CAG report examined the crop insurance schemes -- NAIS, MNAIS and Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) implemented during 2011-12 through 2015-16. These schemes, however, now have been replaced with new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojan (PMFBY) from 2016 kharif season.?During 2011-16, AIC had released Rs 36,222.79 crore as premium subsidy to 10 private insurance companies without compliance with any of the guidelines...,? the auditor said in the report placed before Parliament.It added that the AIC failed to exercise due diligence by verification of claims by private insurance companies before releasing the funds to them. It also failed to take re- insurance cover on behalf of both central and state governments.The government auditor also found out that though the central government released its share on time, there were instances of delay by state governments.?Such delays impacted the release of insurance compensation to affected farmers, defeating the fundamental purpose of the schemes to provide timely financial assistance to the farming community,? it observed.According to the CAG report, claims amounting Rs 7,010 crore (under NAIS), Rs 332.45 crore (MNAIS) and Rs 999.28 crore (WBCIS) were pending as on August 2016 due to non- receipt of premium share of state governments, litigations, verification of claims by states, reconciliation and booking errors, among others.The other finding was that during 2011-16, five out of the nine selected states took more than prescribed 45 days with delays of up to 1,069 days in processing claims, it said.The auditor also found out that there were delays in issue of notifications, receipt of declarations from banks within cut-off dates, receipt of yield data from states and processing of claims and irregularities in disbursement of claims by banks to farmers? accounts.Even monitoring of the schemes was ?very poor? as implementing agencies did not do it effectively, the CAG noted.?Even though huge funds under the schemes were provided to private companies, there was no provision for audit by the CAG to ensure proper utilisation of funds...,? it said.There was also lack of awareness as 67% farmers surveyed during the audit were not aware of the schemes. There was no proper grievance redressal system and monitoring mechanism for speedy settlement of farmers? complaints at the central or state government level, it added.",general,2920,60,70

TV stars can't endorse brands is backward thinking: Divyanka,"Television in India is now nearly as big as Bollywood ? top TV stars are often paid more and have a bigger social media following than film actors with middling fame. Major TV stars are also getting substantial role in films. But for all that, lucrative brand endorsements still elude them.Commenting on this, actor Arjun Bijlani (Left Right Left; Naagin) told us in a recent interview, ?As a medium we [TV actors] cater to a larger audience. So, I really don?t understand why we can?t be the face of a Coke or Pepsi ad, like film and sports stars. At the end of the day, what matters is whether the product sells. I think some brands have too much money to spend, and they believe only movie and sports stars are worth that amount. I am hoping that the perspective would change.?Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya (Ye Hai Mohabbatein) agrees with this, and talks of the TV stars? own brand value. ?We?ve become a brand in ourselves, beyond our shows,? she states. ?My fans look up to me. Thanks to social media, we?re now easily reachable. The number of followers we have isn?t any less than [that of] film actors. Those who think we can?t promote a popular brand? I?d consider it backward thinking.?Here?s a look at what numbers say about star status: TV actor Jennifer Winget gets Rs 1 lakh per episode for her show Beyhadh, where Bollywood actor Amyra Dastur earned approximately Rs 24 lakh for her last film, Kung Fu Yoga. Yet, Amyra endorses Pepsi, while Jennifer has big brands in her kitty.Interestingly, Divyanka, fellow TV actor Rashami Desai (Uttaran), and filmmaker Sidharth P. Malhotra (producer of shows such as Zindagi Wins and Ichchapyaari Naagin) say that TV actors do get offers from a few popular brands, but only for digital, banners, and print ads, and not TV commercials.For the past three years, Divyanka has been turning down offers from a Pantene and Surf Excel, as she has very little spare time. Rashami says that she gets offers to promote brands, but only via social media. ?In big cities, you see big banner ads with popular film actors and sport stars; TV actors replace them in small towns,? says Malhotra, who is directing the Rani Mukerji-starrer Hichki.Model-VJ-actor Keith Sequeira, who was part of Raymond?s The Complete Man campaign, says that there is a clear demarcation between Bollywood and television actors when leading brands look for a face to market their product. ?Brands prefer a model over a TV actor because they want freshness. TV has its separate audience and is part of a daily affair. So, TV actors are considered only for ads to do with dishwashing powder, hand wash etc, which are daily essentials,? he says.Trade Analyst Atul Mohan adds, ?Film actors are popular across India and overseas territories. But as far as TV is concerned, along with Hindi shows, there are regional TV shows, too. So actors who are popular in Hindi TV might not be that well-known in all the regions. That?s also a reason for not choosing them as brand ambassadors.?Ad filmmaker Prahlad Kakkar feels that having TV actors in everyone?s drawing room every day makes them less exclusive. He says, ?You watch a film of a certain actor after a gap, unlike TV. Also sports personalities have a wider reach. When you see TV actors every day, what?s the point of seeing them in ads, too? Where is the exclusivity??However, ad filmmaker Pinaki Bose finds the whole debate subjective. According to him, ad filmmakers don?t go by who is a film actor or a TV personality. He says, ?We?re more concerned about who is apt for the product and the brand?s aspirational value. Which is why, for a a Manyavar ad, we chose [television] actor Satish Sharma. Another thing that?s considered is an actor?s or sport personality?s recall value ? if someone is asked to name top five actors, in all probability she/he will start with Bollywood actors.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",general,3879,60,70
"J&K coaching centre puts terror victim, comedian's pic in ad","Mug shots of a school boy, one among the over 140 school kids killed in a deadly terrorist attack at a school in Peshawar in 2014, and a successful Pakistani-Canadian comedian featured in a full-page ad about a coaching centre?s successful candidates in national engineering and medical entrance exams.A full-page ad by Srinagar?s HOPE Classes in Saturday?s edition Greater Kashmir was meant to congratulate its 37 successful candidates in NEET 2017 (medical entrance) and 53 in the JEE Mains 2017. But the ad has gone horribly wrong. Both the list feature students Mohd Yaqoob and Irfan Ahmad -- and Yaqoob?s mug-shot is that of Mohammad Yaseen, killed in Peshawar school attack and Ahmad?s photo is that of Shahveer Jafry, a Pakistani comedian and video artiste.The ad has, one the one hand, led to hilarious reactions on social media while many parents have raised concerns on whether such coaching centres add names of fake students to their list of successful candidates to boost its reputation.HOPE Classes owned up the terrible mistake.?It was a mistake by a designer employed by us. Actually, photos of all the successful candidates had not arrived so he perhaps inserted available photos. It?s a mistake and in tomorrow?s newspapers we will publish a corrigendum apologising for this mistake,? a senior official of the institute told HT.The JEE Mains and NEET results site both require a candidate?s roll number and date of birth to check his or her result. The advertisement did not mention any such details of the students. Successive calls to the mobile numbers provided to find out the same were not answered. Media reports said over 12000 aspirants from J-K have qualified the NEET 2017 exam.The gaffe came to light when an immensely popular Kashmiri comedy Facebook page, Jajeer Talkies, shared comparative photos and wrote: ?Here?s a picture of Muhammad Yaseen who was killed in Peshawar Attacks.

Photo shows how close flight came to crashing onto 4 planes,"Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That?s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane?s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.?It was close, much too close,? said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators ?that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,? the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane?s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation.",business,2303,59,70

He also took money during assembly polls due to which party had to suffer defeat"", said BSP General Secretary and Rajya Sabha member Satish Chandra Mishra.Siddiqui, who hails from Banda, was earlier removed as the party in-charge of Uttar Pradesh and was appointed as the the MP unit in-charge after the assembly poll debacle.Mishra also alleged that Nasimuddin used to accept money from people in return for work and added that the BSP will not tolerate such indiscipline.MAYAWATI'S ORGANISATIONAL REJIGBSP supremo Mayawati had carried out a major organisational rejig after the assembly polls, and launched her brother Anand Kumar in active politics making him the party's vice-president.With a view to revamp her party, Mayawati had also dissolved the existing team of zonal, divisional and district coordinators and brotherhood committees set up to woo different castes and communities like Brahmins, Thakur and Muslims.After the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in which BSP failed to open its account, the BSP again suffered a humiliating defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections where the party had managed to secure only 19 seats out of the total 403 seats.Mayawati had blamed EVMs for her party's poor performance.On the AAP's demonstration on EVMs in Delhi Assembly yesterday, Mishra said, ""BSP was the first to raise the issue of misuse of EVMs"".Also ReadMayawati's brother Anand Kumar is now BSP Number 2Uttar Pradesh: Local BSP leader shot dead in Allahabad",general,1760,57,70

Mumbai may get second underground Metro,"The city could soon get its second underground Metro line after the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ corridor. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority is planning to extend the Wadala?Ghatkopar?Thane?Kasarvadavali Metro 4 up to GPO at Fort in south Mumbai. MMRDA officials said the detailed project report is in the final stages and the Wadala-General Post Office extension is likely to be partially underground. The 8-km extension will pass through the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) on the eastern waterfront. Officials haven?t planned how much of the extension will be elevated and how much of it will be underground. The extension is being planned to provide connectivity up to south Mumbai via port land, which is going to be developed as a ?second Marine Drive? by MbPT.?The south Mumbai extension will be partially underground. The corridor will be taken underground wherever we can?t make it elevated. A detailed report is expected in September,? said Pravin Darade, additional metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA.Senior MbPT officials are keen on an underground corridor for the stretch that passes through its land. MbPT is currently carrying out a study on how to commercially exploit the its 550-hectare land parcel. They have envisaged to revamp the eastern waterfront into a hub of recreation and entertainment. ?MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out,? said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially. According to officials, the per km cost for the elevated corridor is estimated to be Rs300 crore and Rs750 crore for the underground portion.With the extension of the Metro 4, there would be two Metro lines operating in south Mumbai. The Metro-4 corridor would cater to the commuters from the eastern suburbs, while the Metro 3 would be an alternative to commuters living in the western suburbs.Read more: Mumbai metro gets machines to crush your plastic bottles, give you 25% discount on clothes, sunglasses",general,2127,39,70

Political biopics are now radioactive: Siddharth Roy Kapur,"Coming on the heels of the controversy about Indu Sarkar, a top official of the Film and Television Producers Guild of India says such topics have become ?radioactive? nowadays. Speaking at the Word To Screen, Publishers Bootcamp by Jio MAMI here, Guild president Siddharth Roy Kapur said that ?making a biopic on a political figure is radioactive right now?.Later, prodded by IANS to elaborate on the sidelines of the event, Kapur said, ?It?s unfortunately the environment that we are in at this point of time that most filmmakers are self-censoring when it comes to subjects that they pick to make a movie about because they are concerned about how it will finally be received when it goes to the CBFC for clearance. In that process, we might be really losing out on quite a few interesting stories that should be told, and I do hope that the environment changes.?Movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha and Udta Punjab ran foul of the censor board but were cleared after appeals or cuts.Kapur, former head honcho of Studios, Disney UTV, said that former actress Smriti Irani?s appointment as Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting, would bring about a change for the Indian film industry which was constantly battling censorship woes. ?It?s a very positive step because she?s someone who understands the industry. I?m quite certain that we will see an easy and a more liberal view of film certification in the months to come,? Kapur said.?I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. I do hope that?s implemented at the earliest,? added Kapur.Given that the $2 billion film industry of India, one of the largest movie-producing nations in the world, was not generating the moolah it should for a multiple of reasons -- lack of screens, slowdown in domestic theatrical revenue, steady growth in Hollywood market share and emergence of digital platforms and quality content -- Kapur sees light at the end of the tunnel.?Every industry goes through cyclical times. The cycle we are going through right now is where the economics are very challenging. Having said that, I?m quite optimistic that since we have a very strong movie-going culture, our own ethos of a star system and our own grammar of storytelling, we will come out of this,? said Kapur.?I think it?s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. And once that changes, we will see the industry do much better,? he said, adding how filmmakers need to be ?smart about their films?, release date and strategy.As for Hollywood eating into local films? business, he said, ?It?s happening and it?s definitely something to be concerned about... Because the fact is that they are making movies that are bringing people to cinemas... And that?s what we need to do too.?Exorbitant fee charged by stars can sometimes inflate a film?s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?I don?t think the star system will break and I don?t think it should. But I think that along with the star system, there needs to be great content that can stand on its own without any star. I have seen so many movies in the recent past that have done this and have done it very effectively,? he said.Kapur has been associated -- as producer, co-producer or associate producer -- with a mix of these -- Dangal, Kai Po Che, The Lunchbox, Raajneeti, Barfi!, Chennai Express, Shahid, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, A Wednesday and Paan Singh Tomar. Now he is on a new journey of his own -- that of driving his home banner Roy Kapur Films.?I?m very excited about this next phase of my career where I will be looking at all kinds of content across the board, genre-agnostic, completely. I just want to tell great stories; do some great movies that I can be proud of,? he said.His slate includes an Aamir Khan-starrer biopic on astronaut Rakesh Sharma and a biopic based on the life of a man named Vijendra Singh who had lost his wife Leela in the Uttarakhand floods.Not ready to spill more beans about any of his projects, Kapur said: ?It?s a little early to talk about any of them at this point of time.?",entertainment,4340,58,70
Tarantino to direct film on Manson Family murders: Report,"According to The Hollywood Reporter, Quentin Tarantino is quietly starting to put together his latest project and is talking to A-list actors for what is promising to be a unique take on the Manson Family murders.The project, whose title is unknown, was written by Tarantino, who will also direct.Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who have produced and executive produced the previous Tarantino films, are involved.In this Aug. 20, 1970, file photo, Charles Manson, head of the cultic Manson Family charged with murder-conspiracy in the Tate-LaBianca slayings, is escorted by deputy sheriffs to court in Los Angeles. (AP) They?re said to be in the early stages of shopping the project to studios to co-finance and co-distribute the venture.The move apes the way Tarantino and the Weinsteins made the filmmaker?s 2009 movie Inglourious Basterds, which had Universal Studios as a financial and distributing partner. The director is putting the finishing touches on the script. Brad Pitt, who worked with the filmmaker on Basterds, and Jennifer Lawrence have been approached. Studios could receive the package after Labor Day, according to one source.Script details are fuzzy but one of the stories centres on Sharon Tate, the actor and wife of director Roman Polanski who was murdered by Manson and his followers in 1969.In this Feb. 24, 1970 file photo, Patricia Krenwinkel, a defendant in the Tate murder case, enters the superior court in Los Angeles for an arraignment. Krenwinkel, a follower of cult killer Charles Manson, is again seeking parole Thursday 22, 2017. (AP) Manson had ordered a group of his followers to attack the inhabitants of a house in the Benedict Canyon part of Los Angeles, believing it was owned by a record producer who earlier had rejected him.Over the course of several hours on the night of August 8, the four followers, using guns and knives, brutally killed Tate, who was eight months pregnant, and four other occupants.In 1971, Manson and certain members of his crew were sentenced to life imprisonment for these and several other murders committed that summer.The movie is eyeing to start shooting in 2018.Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,2188,57,70
No immediate arrest in dowry cases without investigation: SC,"A Family Welfare Committee (FWC) in every district will scrutinise dowry harassment cases before local police can arrest the accused, the Supreme Court said on Thursday, laying down a set of guidelines to curb misuse of the law.Indian Penal Code?s Section 498A has been criticised for giving ?disgruntled women? a legal option to harass their husbands, and Thursday?s orders take forward measures announced by the top court in 2014 when it prohibited automatic arrests.A bench of justices AK Goel and UU Lalit barred the police from making direct arrest and said the involvement of civil society was necessary ?to achieve the laudable object of punishing cruelty at the hands of husbands or his relatives against the wife?.Quoting the National Crime Records Bureau?s 2012 data, the bench said that a quarter of all arrests were those of women ? mothers and sisters of husbands ? and while chargesheets were filed at an ?exponentially high 93.6%? of cases, only 14.4% ended in convictions. The report projected that out of the 3,72,706 cases pending trial in 2012, as many as 3,17,000 were projected to lead to acquittals.Curbing misuseForm 3-member committee in every district of para-legal volunteers, social workers, working officers? wives or suitable citizensDecide bail applications on same day as far as possibleGrant exemption from personal appearance or allow it by videoconferencingDon?t make passport impounding or red corner notice routine for people residing out of IndiaThe court, however, put a rider to its restrictions, saying that they were not valid in offences involving tangible physical injury or death.?It is a matter of serious concern that large number of cases continues to be filed under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitised,? the bench said.The top court also ordered that trial courts must decide bail applications in such cases on the same day as far as possible. Recovery of disputed dowry items may not by itself be a ground for denial of bail if maintenance or other rights of wife/minor children can otherwise be protected, SC said.According to the ruling, the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) will form the committee comprising three members who could be para-legal volunteers, social workers, retired persons, wives of working officers or citizens who may be found suitable and willing.A dowry harassment complaint to the police or magistrate will be referred to the committee that can interact with the parties personally or through electronic communication. The committee must submit its report to the authority, which refers the complaint to it within a month.Till the report is received, no arrest should be effected, the court said. After considering the report on its own merit, the police or magistrate will proceed with further action.SC also directed that only a designated Investigating Officer of the area shall investigate dowry harassment cases. Such designations must be done within a month, the court said. These officers must be trained, which the court held must be completed within four months.In further directions to lower courts, the SC said that accused should be exempted from appearing in person or be allowed to appear via video conferencing as far as that does not adversely affect the progress of the case.In cases where accused is residing out of India, impounding of passports or red corner notice should not be a routine, the court said.In cases where a settlement is reached, it will be open to a district and sessions judge or any other senior judicial officer nominated by him in the district to complete the proceedings including the closing of the criminal case if dispute primarily relates to matrimonial discord. Committee?s functioning may be reviewed once a year, SC added.In 2014, a separate bench had criticised the law?s misuse and said: ?The fact that Section 498-A is a cognisable and non-bailable offence has lent it a dubious place of pride amongst the provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives?.",general,4262,60,70

Petitions against textbook calling Bhindranwale a terrorist,"Sikh organisations in Maharashtra have written to education minister Vinod Tawde to remove references to Jarnailsingh Bhindranwale, a militant preacher who was killed in the military operation at Amritsar?s Golden Temple in June 1984, as a ?terrorist? in the Maharashtra state education board?s class 9 history textbook.The textbook based on the new syllabus was released in the market earlier this month. The Sikh groups have asked the government to amend the paragraphs on page 6 and 10 that mention Bhindranwale and his followers as ?terrorists?. Under a chapter titled ?India?s Internal Challenges, Operation Bluestar?, conducted by the army in Amritsar, where militants supporting the Khalistan movement were hiding, is described as ?an operation to evict terrorists hiding in the Golden Temple.? On page 6, it further states, ?The Sikhs in Punjab demanded an independent state of Khalistan and began a movement which went onto become violent and destructive. Pakistan lent it support.? More ?objectionable? references are made to Bhindranwale and other militants throughout the page. ?The main task of getting the terrorists out of the Golden Temple was entrusted to?? and ?The operation ended with the death of Bhindranwale and other terrorists.?The issue was first highlighted in Punjab by Damdami Taksal, a Sikh seminary, which was headed by Bhindranwale before he was killed in Operation Bluestar. In a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Taksal complained against ?disseminating sensitive information to impressionable minds of school students that would put the Sikh community in a poor light.?Following this, Sikh community groups in Mumbai have also written to Tawde to rephrase the paragraphs on Bhindranwale. ?He was not a terrorist, he was a saint,? said Puran Singh Banga, general secretary, Sat Sri Akaal Charitable Trust and president of Sri Guru Nanak Darbar, Chembur. ?The government should have consulted with Sikh groups and other academicians before printing the text.?Refusing to comment on this, Sunil Magar, director of state?s textbook publishing bureau, Balbharti, said, ?The matter is in the Bombay high court. We are preparing our reply to the court.? Magar added, ?We had published the information in the book on the basis of historical evidence and proof.?On the other hand, history teachers in Mumbai argued that the information is historically accurate. ?Bhindranwale?s activities endangered several Indians, many people were killed,? said a history teacher from Bhandup on the condition of anonymity. ?Tilak and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose can be considered as ?extremists?, but from the point of view of the British, they too can be called ?terrorists?,? the teacher added.

DIG Roopa gets notice to publish apology in newspapers,"Former Karnataka deputy inspector general of prisons Roopa D Moudgil, who alleged that AIADMK leader VK Sasikala received preferential treatment in Bengaluru Central Prison by paying a bribe, has been issued a legal notice by former director general of police (prisons) HN Sathyanarayana Rao seeking unconditional apology for saying there were allegations of bribery against him.In her controversial report, Moudgil had said she heard allegations Sasikala paid a bribe of Rs 2 crore to senior prison officials, including Rao, for getting privileged treatment, which, among other things, including a private kitchen.Moudgil was transferred to the position of inspector general of police and commissioner for traffic and road safety, Bengaluru. Rao was also transferred, but without charge as he is set to retire at the end of the month.In a notice dated July 16 and released by his lawyers, Rao has denied all the allegations and sought a public apology from Moudgil within three days of receiving the notice.The notice says Rao will file defamation suits, both civil and criminal, for Rs 50 crore even if Moudgil apologises, as her report, coming just a few days before Rao?s retirement, ?has caused untold mental agony to him?.Reacting to the notice on Thursday, Moudgil stuck to her stand.?I have done my duty... There is a complaint pending with the anti-corruption bureau, and it has to look into the matter,?

Moudgil said. ?I?m sure the truth will emerge.?In the notice, a copy of which HT has accessed, Rao?s lawyers have accused Moudgil of leaking her report to Rao on the alleged irregularities even before it reached him. ?Thus, it is clear that publicity was the main intention in writing such a complaint,? the notice says.The notice says Moudgil had some axe to grind against Rao ?and to achieve same you have made baseless allegations and the same has tarnished the image of my client.?Accusing Moudgil of taking photos elsewhere in the prison compound, the notice questions why she could not take photos of the alleged privileges that had been allowed to Sasikala. ?The reason is obvious that you could not take photo of a non-existent kitchen,? the notice says.?You claim that you have taken pictures of irregularities inside the prison. But you have not taken the picture of Sasikala?s separate kitchen and other royal facilities, which are the prime subject of your allegations. You could not take pictures because nothing like that existed,? the notice says.Meanwhile, the inquiry ordered by the chief minister headed by a retired Indian Administrative Service officer is underway.

He claims he had no knowledge of the mob violence at Mahagun Moderne Society that was going on a few hundred metres from his shop at that time.Ramesh is one of the 30-odd kiosk owners whose makeshift shops were demolished by the Noida authority on Monday as the temporary structures had come up on government land.He said he had spent Rs20,000 to acquire the shop and the goods he needed. Like Ramesh, there are other 30 other shopkeepers who have lost their livelihood the demolition drive six days after the violence at Mahagun Moderne society violence.Rumours of a domestic help being beaten up and held captive had enraged a mob which allegedly attacked the housing society and vandalised property there.The Noida authority has officially claimed that the demolition was not due to the recent violence, but the demands for action against ?illegal? workers in Noida have increased ever since.However, Ramesh fails to understand what he has to do with it all. ?I had nothing to do with the crowd that attacked Mahagun society. I am a resident of Barola village and was busy setting up my tea shop when the violence took place in the society. I have three children to look after and the officers have demolished my shop and destroyed my livelihood,? he said.Ramesh?s friend Pappu (36), who like Ramesh says he belongs to Hardoi district in UP, too sold vegetables in the area from a kiosk that was demolished on Monday.?My wife is dead and I am supposed to feed my three children.

How will I earn from tomorrow?

Many patients had no idea initially and kept standing in the queue,? said Sanjana Rawat, a nurse at LHMC.There are 38 hospitals under the Delhi government. Resident doctors in hospitals under the central government, except the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, were also part of the protest. Delhi government hospitals every day witness nearly 1,600 pre-scheduled surgeries and over 200 emergency ones.Patients in several other government hospitals such as Lal Bahadur Sastri Hospital, Dadadev Mother and Child Hospital and GB Pant were affected as only the emergency departments were functional and even the normal medicine OPD remained partially operational.?Nearly 60 per cent of patients at Dadadev Mother and Child hospital could not get doctors consultation or treatment due to the protest. However, the emergency cases were somehow treated as resident doctors having duty in emergency department were not part of the protest,? said Nirupam Ghosh, associated with the administration wing of Dadadev Mother and Child hospital. Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) -- under whose banner the protest was being held in Delhi -- said of the 5,400 OPD cards registered in Delhi government hospitals on Thursday only 25 per cent of patients could consult doctors. The resident doctors have also threatened to go on a pan India strike soon if the government fails to ensure them a safe atmosphere to perform their duties. ?This mass casual leave was just an indication of what we can do to ensure our safety.

(PTI) ?We are taking suo motu cognisance of the matter and sending him a letter asking him to apologise or retract his statement,? Kumaramangalam said.The actor, speaking to the media on Wednesday, had named the actress while answering a question on the security of women in the film industry. ?Why is it the safety of women in the film industry alone? A female?s presence in the crowd is important to me and I will not let anything happen to her. It?s our duty to see if you are safe. It is not just about actresses. We are not supporting her (mentions the name), because she is an actress,? he said.When it was pointed out that sexual assault victims should not be identified, he said, ?It doesn?t matter if I have used the name. You have put out her name everywhere. Do not hide the name as there is nothing wrong with it. If you want to call her Draupadi, call her Draupadi. Don?t call her ?a female?.?Haasan was addressing the media regarding a complaint raised by a fringe Hindu Group over the ongoing Tamil reality TV show, Bigg Boss, which he hosts.Kumaramangalam said the actor?s statement revealed the ?patriarchal mindset? among ?VIPs, big guys...whether they are in politics or not in politics?. ?It also shows lack of humility in him and that?s what we are going to say (in the letter). It is very arrogant to say that somebody else has said it so I will say it too,? she said, adding that the letter would be sent soon.Haasan, is ?undoubtedly a brilliant actor, but that doesn?t give him the right to say something ?so insensitive?, said Kumaramangalam.To name minor victims and victims of sexual assault or printing or using their name which makes their identity known is prohibited by the law. Section 228 A of the Indian Penal Code bans the disclosure of the identity of victims of certain offences, including sexual assault, barring specified circumstances.Violation of this can be punished with a fine or imprisonment which may extend to two years. ?He (Kamal Haasan) can?t be booked by us but someone else like the victim herself or fans can lodge a protest. The police can do it on their own also. When someone like him who has billions of fans says something like this, it sets a bad precedent,? said Kumaramangalam.The NCW chief also said all that the actor had to do was apologise.?If he has made a mistake it won?t make him small to say that ?I am sorry?. In fact, he doesn?t even need to use the word ?sorry? -- he could just say, ?I didn?t mean to say it?. People of his stature should have the common sense and humility to understand the sensitivity of such situations,? she said.Kumaramangalam, who conceded that she felt ?strongly? about public figures being ?insensitive?, had issued a notice to actor Salman Khan for ?trivialising rape? in a press meet in Mumbai last July.Haasan?s reference was to an actress of Malayalam films who was abducted and raped in February this year.

Rural areas in Gurugram to get 24x7 power supply from Aug 15,"The state government?s promise that Gurgaon will be free of power cuts and get 24x7 electricity supply from August 15 got a new twist on Sunday. Shatrujeet Kapoor, chairman-cum-managing director of Haryana?s two power distribution companies, said that Gurgaon?s urban areas are already getting 24x7 power supply and now the government aims to improve electricity supply in villages.Kapoor, who heads Uttar and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitaran Nigam (UHBVN-DHBVN), met panchayat representatives and discom officials at Farrukhnagar on Sunday to review the plan to provide uninterrupted power supply in?Gurgaon.?There are outages and technical faults in Gurgaon causing power cuts, but those area separate issues and have to be handled at the local level. The government had already announced that Gurgaon (urban areas)?will get uninterrupted power supply,? Kapoor said.?Our aim is to provide 24-hour electricity to rural areas of the district. The DHBVN has chalked out a plan for uninterrupted electricity to villages from August 15,? he added.Responding to Kapoor?s claims of urban Gurgaon getting uninterrupted power supply, Animesh Saxena, president of Udyog Vihar Industry Association, said, ?This is not true at all. We are dependent on generators for power back up as an average of four to five-hour power cuts continue to take place. If it happens due to a local fault, it is their (the discom?s)?responsibility to improve distribution.?Industry owners in the city have been grappling with long power cuts for the past four months.?If the infrastructure is pathetic, who is responsible for that? Who will rectify the error and improve electricity supply? Kapoor cannot get away by saying it has been announced that Gurgaon is getting uninterrupted power supply. The fact of the matter is that industries are facing an average of four-hour power cuts daily. So the government?s claim of uninterrupted supply is an eyewash,? said Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar.The government aims to make Gurgaon and Ambala districts power-cut free from August 15. According to Kapoor, the government has prepared a blueprint under which rural feeders of these two districts will be strengthened and power infrastructure improved as per requirement. He said a Bijli Sudhar Samiti would be formed in every village of Gurgaon and Ambala to help make the plan a success. He added that faulty electricity lines will be replaced and new transformers installed in the district for which a Rs45-crore fund has been approved.The CMD said that the power utilities have distributed around 1.25 crore LED bulbs in the last one year to save around 200 mega watt (MW) power daily.

US to suspend covert CIA program in Syria: Reports,"Donald Trump has decided to halt the CIA?s covert programme to equip and train moderate rebels fighting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, in a move likely to be welcomed by Russia?s Vladimir Putin.The CIA programme began in 2013 as part of Barack Obama?s support for the overthrow of Assad but met with little success, two officials told Reuters. Some armed and trained rebels defected to Islamic State and other radical groups.One of the officials was quoted as saying the US is not making a major concession, given Assad?s continued grip on power, but ?it?s a signal to Putin that the administration wants to improve ties to Russia?.Along with Iran, Moscow has played a critical part in shoring up Assad during the the six-year civil war.The decision was made with national security adviser HR McMaster and CIA director Mike Pompeo after they consulted with lower ranking officials, and before Trump?s 7 July meeting with Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Germany, Reuters reported. It was not part of US-Russian negotiations on a limited ceasefire in south-west Syria the two leaders agreed to at the summit, the officials said.Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said: ?It?s a victory for Assad, Iran and Putin, all of which carried the day. But it?s also a victory for America: in this case I do believe Trump is pursuing the correct policy.?Trying to destroy Russia in Syria is a fool?s errand because Russia is helping to pursue al-Qaida and Isis there. Since when is destroying extremism a bad thing? Just because Russia is for it doesn?t automatically make it bad.?Landis said that it had become clear that the rebels will not win, the US has no leverage over Assad ? and a large percentage of the arms are falling into the hands of extremists.?Obama was on his way to making the same decision,? he said. ?Many people would now be genuinely happy if Assad could conquer the rest of Isis territory. In a sense this is the raggedy end of a rationale for regime change. America has learned from many nasty experiences that violent regime change in the Middle East does not produce democracy and human rights.?The Washington Post was first to report the programme?s suspension on Wednesday. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, deputy press secretary at the White House, declined to comment on the topic. The CIA also declined to comment. But Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told the Washington Post: ?We are falling into a Russian trap. We are making the moderate resistance more and more vulnerable ... We are really cutting them off at the neck.?A separate effort by the US military effort to train, arm and support other Syrian rebel groups with air strikes and other actions will continue.Trump, who in April launched a cruise missile attack on Syria in response to Assad?s use of chemical weapons, is under scrutiny by Congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether his associates colluded.On Wednesday Sanders played down the controversy over a second, undisclosed meeting that Trump held with Putin at a dinner during the G20 summit.?I think that once again, the Russia fever has caught up with the media and everybody ran out and tried to create a story that simply didn?t exist,? she told reporters. ?To try to create that there was some kind of private conversation in a room with 40-plus people seems a little bit ridiculous.?According to witnesses, Trump rose from his seat and took a place next to Putin, then conversed for an hour with only a Russian interpreter present. The absence of an American official has been widely criticised as a breach of protocol.Sanders added: ?They had a brief conversation and I?m not going to get into the specifics of the conversation but again, this was a social dinner where the president spoke with many world leaders as is the purpose. I think it would be incredibly awkward for them to all be at a dinner and not speak with each other.?Asked if the decision to end the CIA programme came up during the dinner conversation, the deputy press secretary replied: ?Not that I?m aware of.?",general,4183,50,70

These include the latest Luyang-III or the Kunming class stealth destroyers.Armed with surface-air and long range missiles the Chinese warships are projecting power far away from the Beijing's backyard but in India's immediate vicinity. The silver lining - India is constantly monitoring the movement of Chinese warships courtesy Indian satellites and long range maritime surveillance platforms.The Indian Navy's long range surveillance platforms like the US made P81 has been watching and recording movements of the Chinese Navy in the Indian Ocean.

Worryingly for India, the increased warship deployment goes hand in hand with the deployment of Hydrographic, Oceanographic vessels and spy-ships in the Indian Ocean to map the sea bed.Bathymetric data among other things detail how currents and noise behave at particular depth, the lay of the ocean floor are critical for submarine deployments.Top sources told India Today that Chinese Naval Ship Haiwngxing -spy ship -entered the Indian Ocean this month. The spy ship equipped with sophisticated equipment is deployed to collect electronic intelligence among other things. It is capable of honing on electronic signals which can be returned to China for analysis. New Delhi has been told that the spy ship is the Indian Ocean region to monitor the annual tri-lateral India-USJapan naval exercise - Malabar that starts on July 7. The same ship was used to spy on previous Indo-US Naval exercises.ALSO READ| Chinese warships frequently visit Karachi, Gwadar in bid to expand presence in Indian Ocean",general,3670,53,70

WATCH FULL VIDEOMeanwhile, Zaheer Khan has been named bowling coach while Rahul Dravid will be batting coach for overseas tours.BCCI said that the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, who conducted the interviews, recommended these appointments in the ""best interest"" of Indian cricket.The term of the appointments will be till the World Cup 2019.""Shastri has been the team director in the past, and brings with him a wealth of experience, both as player and as coach,"" said board's acting Secretary Amitabh Choudhary.""Zaheer is a contemporary cricketer who assumed the mentoring role to a young fast bowling unit even during his playing days with India. His inputs and wisdom will be of immense value to our young fast bowlers, who have shown tremendous potential in the last couple of years. And, as the Indian team is to play plenty of Test cricket overseas in the next two years, Rahul Dravid's expertise as batting consultant will be immensely helpful for youngsters,"" he added.

According to annual reports of various banks, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya took home Rs 28.96 lakh last fiscal, which is pittance when compared to remuneration her counterparts in private banks receive.

Satam estimated the redevelopment of the access points to cost Rs80 lakh, under a Rs12-crore Juhu beach tourism plan. Of the eight points, Birla Lane, Military road, Granth lane and Silver beach lane have already been redeveloped. ?The first phase of the project included themed-lighting and redevelopment of the central Chowpatty. This is a one of its kind lighting and won?t hamper the natural feel of the beach,? said Satam. Officials said the second phase will be completed by the end of August and the themed-lighting will be inaugurated by CM Devendra Fadnavis.",general,1973,37,70

I wish Kangana gets along with co-stars in future: Shahid,"Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut's cold war has crossed all possible contours of normalcy and has probably crossed over to the bizarre now. The film that Shahid and Kangana starred in and which was the beginning of all the drama, Rangoon, has sunk into oblivion. But trust the actors to not let sleeping dogs lie.After repeated jibes from Kangana regarding his 'mood swings' and behaviour on the sets of Rangoon, now Shahid Kapoor has spoken out about it all.In an interview with Filmfare, when Shahid was asked about Kangana saying that it was difficult to kiss him with his thick moustache in Rangoon, the Kaminey actor said, ""Kangana has a thing for one-liners. I'm not one of those. I'd rather focus on the movie. I like positivity. We shared a professional equation. So, I was also surprised by the comments. I also read some retractions she made later that she didn't mean it in a bad way.""During the promotions of Rangoon, when IndiaToday.in asked Shahid about any 'incidents' during the shoot of the Vishal Bhardwaj-directed film, Shahid had denied it all with a curt, ""No, no incidents on this movie.""However, Kangana Ranaut would beg to differ. From talking about how on certain days Shahid would treat her like she was a 'suicide bomber' to his severe mood swings, Kangana bared it all to filmmaker and talk-show host Karan Johar on KJo's show.Shahid went on to tell the magazine, ""When actors start engaging in this table-tennis match through interviews, which the media feeds off, the focus is then on the actors and not the film. I don't believe in publicising a film or myself through this kind of activity.""The fights sure made Rangoon more the talking point than what it normally would have been.",general,1713,57,70
I may not leave Russian presidency: Vladimir Putin,"Asked what he plans to do when he leaves the presidency, Vladimir Putin paused and smiled. ?But I haven?t decided yet if I will leave the presidency,? the Russian leader replied, to laughter and applause from an audience made up almost entirely of Russians who were born after he first became president in 2000.A month after thousands of young Russians took to the streets to protest against corruption among the Kremlin elite, Putin held a set-piece discussion event on Friday with hundreds of children, in an apparent attempt to portray himself as a youth-friendly president. Presidential elections will take place next March and Putin is widely expected to stand and win another six-year term. An opposition politician, Alexei Navalny, who organised the recent round of protests, has said he would like to stand but his name is unlikely to be allowed on the ballot paper.Putin spent three hours speaking with the assembled children, in a session broadcast live on Russian television. Those present appeared to have been screened to ensure there would be no hostile questions. The discussion took place at Sirius, a school in Sochi for gifted children, which Putin opened several years ago. The tone of the discussion was set by the first question, when Putin was thanked for backing the school and for giving opportunities to so many children. ?I can also tell you that I even thought up the name: Sirius,? said Putin, to prolonged applause.Sitting in an open-necked white shirt, with hundreds of schoolchildren arranged in circles around him, Putin took questions from those present and at times picked out cards with pre-written questions on them in a game-show-style format.Unlike Putin?s press conferences and phone-ins with the nation, which usually vary across a range of topics from foreign policy to the minutiae of regional problems, his discussion with the children was divided between talk about their own achievements in sport, music and science, and questions about Putin?s personal life and preferences.?I like chatting with my friends, reading historical books, listening to music and doing sport,? said Putin when asked what he does in his spare time. At times, Putin was in philosophical mood, answering questions about the three values that are most important to him in life (?love, freedom and life itself?) and when asked what his childhood dream was, he declined to say but dispensed some life advice: ?You know, dreams are things that change over time. You should instead be happy that you have a dream and you should make strides towards it.?Asked whether he used the internet, Putin said almost never but said the way people use nicknames and fake identities online was quite similar to how he had adopted false identities during his work for the KGB.There was very little discussion of politics and no mention of Navalny?s investigations into corruption among Putin?s inner circle, which were the motivation for the recent protests. The one nod to the recent events was a softball question asking what Putin thought of opposition politicians. The president, who has never uttered Navalny?s name in public, said merely that in Ukraine people had used anti-corruption slogans to get into power and now the country was even more corrupt. The discussion quickly moved on, with a synchronised skating team telling Putin it was their dream to have a photograph with him on ice: Putin said he would be happy to oblige.Major foreign policy questions were also absent from the discussion and there was no talk of the alleged Russian interference in the US elections or Putin?s recent meeting with Donald Trump at the G20 summit. Indeed, the only American mentioned during the long discussion was Oliver Stone, the film director who made a four-hour documentary about the Russian president, which was criticised in some quarters for being too soft on the president. Putin said he really liked the ?extraordinary? Stone, though admitted he had fallen asleep while trying to watch the film.",world,4006,50,70
Maharashtra announces free insurance scheme for legislators,"The Maharashtra government has decided to give free medical insurance cover of up to Rs10 lakh to all sitting and former legislators and their families. The government will have to set aside Rs9.96 crore a year to pay the insurance premiums of 335 sitting legislators and 837 former legislators ? 1,172 in all. Each premium works out to Rs85,000.Legislators were earlier covered by the government?s medical reimbursement scheme. A committee headed by top medical officials would examine and approve medical bills submitted by legislators. The annual expenditure on such reimbursements was about Rs9crore to Rs10 crore. Under the new scheme, six of a family, regardless of their age and medical condition, are collectively entitled to an insurance cover of up to Rs10 lakh. If the cover is exhausted, the policy has a contingency provision of Rs10 crore for all legislators. Family members of legislators won?t have to undergo any medical tests, said an official. Chief minster Devendra Fadnavis took the decision three weeks ago, said the official.Earlier, the government had proposed an annual insurance cover of Rs15 lakh for each legislator. This would have increased the state?s financial burden by Rs4 crore. With the insurance scheme, the government expects to curb the use of fake bills for reimbursements. ?In many cases, we found that legislators had submitted fake and duplicate bills to claim medical reimbursement,? said an official from the finance department. Officials who clear medical bills said the insurance scheme would be better than the existing one. ?We have a network of 4,700 hospitals across the country under the insurance scheme. It will be a cashless facility and the insured members will not have to pay from their pockets. The reimbursement scheme covered only five critical and 27 serious diseases,? he added.READMaharashtra lawmakers get monthly salary hike with immediate effectMaharashtra govt releases ?894 crore as crop insurance for farmers",politics,1978,60,70

ICC welcomes BCCI's decision to send Indian team for CT 2017,"India confirmed their participation in next month's Champions Trophy in England and Wales on Sunday after initially delaying the announcement of their squad over a revenue sharing disagreement with cricket's governing body.The dispute intensified when India failed to submit a squad for the one-day international tournament by an April 25 deadline after the Board Of Control For Cricket In India (BCCI) was unable to stall a new income model being adopted by the International Cricket Council (ICC).""The Board unanimously authorised the acting honorary secretary of the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC in the best interest of the BCCI while keeping its legal options open,"" the BCCI said after a special general meeting.""The BCCI... unanimously decided that the Indian cricket team will participate in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.""The all-India senior selection meeting will be held tomorrow, May 8, in New Delhi to pick the team.""At last month's ICC meetings, the BCCI was outvoted 13-1 in its bid to halt the revised deal which considerably slashes India's share from global events in the 2015-23 cycle.Unimpressed by the $293 million forecast, down from the $570 million it would have received under a 2014 arrangement, the BCCI responded by refusing to name a squad for the June 1-18 eight-team competition.Acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhary will now continue to negotiate with the world governing body to get a bigger share of ICC revenues during the next eight-year cycle.""The ICC welcomes the unanimous decision from the BCCI special general meeting this morning to confirm the participation of defending champions India in next month's Champions Trophy,"" the ICC said in a statement to Reuters.""The hundreds of millions of cricket fans around the world just want to see good cricket and now we can all look forward to a superb event in England and Wales starting on 1 June.""The option to boycott the event by revoking the Members Participation Agreement (MPA) between the ICC and the BCCI had been gaining traction within the board prior to Sunday's meeting despite a number of former players opposing any withdrawal.The four Supreme Court-appointed administrators (COA), who currently supervise BCCI operations, however, instructed the board to ensure the team continued their preparations to defend their title.",sports,2343,60,70
Why was India's capital shifted from Calcutta to Delhi?,"It was on this day, 100 years ago, that an event changed the course of Delhi's history forever. The Delhi Durbar on December 12, 1911 was marked as a celebration of the coronation of King Emperor George V. Delhi had witnessed two such durbars before, in 1877 and 1903, but the Delhi Durbar of 1911 assumed unusual importance as King George V announced the shifting of British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.As chronicled by HT over the past year in the series New Delhi 100, Delhi in 1911 was just a small town in the Punjab province, still recovering from the wounds inflicted on it by the British regime after the uprising of 1857. But the king's proclamation at the durbar, kept a secret till then, changed Delhi's fate and put it firmly on the international political map.Calcutta, the nerve centre of British Raj till then, had fallen out of favour as it had become politically volatile. The British government wanted to shift the capital and Delhi won on many counts. It was closer to Shimla, the summer capital and was well connected by rail.In the next 20 years, New Delhi would be carved out of scattered villages and a rocky ridge inhabited by jackals. The new capital and its imposing buildings would come to define Delhi for the next 100 years. The capital, however, would keep growing beyond the garden city planned by Edwin Lutyens - and continues to grow.",general,1378,55,70
"Take away office, AAP will function from streets: Kejriwal","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said today that the cancellation of AAPs office allotment was part of a larger design to 'finish' the party. He said the party is being 'victimised' and 'discriminated against' for taking on the ruling mafia and siding with the poor, and asserted the Aam Aadmi Party is ready to operate from the 'streets'. The office allotment to the AAP by the Kejriwal government was cancelled by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor yesterday after the Shunglu Committee pointed out 'irregularities' in the allotment. Kejriwal wondered why the Congress and the BJP, despite having negligible presence in the Delhi politics, have five and seven office spaces respectively, along with one plot each. ""This must be the first time in independent India that a ruling party is being denied office space in the state where it is in power. Even RJD, BSP, ABVP, RSS have offices in Delhi,"" he told a press conference at his residence. Kejriwal linked the cancellation to the AAPs promise of abolishing house tax if voted to power in the municipal corporations, which go to polls on April 23. ""They want to finish us, they want to close AAP. But it wont happen as we are on the path of truth. People will teach them a lesson in the polls,"" he said ""Having an office is our right.

They alerted the police, after which a team of three policemen was rushed to the spot.When the two suspects landed on the road outside, they found themselves face-to-face with the policemen. ?That was when they began firing at us. As both assistant sub-inspector Ramashray Singh and I were armed with pistols, we fired in retaliation,? said constable Kumar.While Nitin was hit in his arms, leg and lower back, Salman managed to escape in the dark.The injured burglar underwent a surgery at the hospital, but needed three-four units of blood.

"PMO paid IAF ?89L for PM's 128 ""non-official"" trips: RTI","The Prime Minister?s Office has paid around Rs 89 lakh to the Indian Air Force for flying Narendra Modi on 128 ?non-official? domestic trips since he took office, an expense that was lower than what it would have been had the PM used through commercial providers.The trips were largely for electioneering, and India?s election code makes it must for ministers ? including the PM ? to reimburse the government if its machinery is used in such cases. The flights provided by IAF were mostly when the Prime Minister had to fly out to remote locations in helicopters or small planes instead of his usual mode of air transport: the Air India One. The rates for these flights were last revised by the defence ministry in 1999.In all, the IAF provided details of 128 non-official flights taken by the PM from May 2014 till February 2017, when Modi was on a whirlwind tour of election-bound states that included Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Assam, the Right to Information reply provided by the air force to Commodore (retired) Lokesh K Batra said. The disclosures could cause some unease among Bharatiya Janata Party?s rivals, who can claim that the lower rates put the PM?s party at an advantage with respect to election spending.In his application, Batra asked the IAF about the domestic visits by the PM and the mode of payment. He also sought details of the rules under which the PM is allowed to use IAF planes for domestic visits.Quoting the rules, the IAF said no charge will be recovered for use of aircraft by the President, vice-president, the prime minister (except when he/she travels otherwise than on official duty), the ministers of defence and home and senior defence ministry officials for defence purposes. The reply said the rates will be calculated at commercial rates if the destination is linked by a regular commercial air service and, in other cases, with reference to per passenger per kilometres rates notified by the defence ministry. The reply said the rates were last notified in 1999.The PMO paid the air force Rs 31,000 for a Delhi-Gorakhpur-Delhi flight and Rs 7,818 for Mangalore-Kasargod-Mangalore flight, which private chartered airline operators said was lower than the commercial rate. The cost for Delhi-Rohtak-Sonipat-Ambala trip was Rs 1,00,440, and the PMO paid Rs 63,957 for Kolkata-Balasore-Kalaikunda-Balasore-Kalaikunda-Bagdogra-Guwahati flight. Cost of some flights like Calicut-Vikram ground was just Rs 5,693.?It is surprising that the PMO has paid for PM?s non-official visits which were for electioneering. As per election rules, his party (BJP) should have paid the money,? Batra said. BJP sources, however, said that the money is paid to the PMO and is shown in the election expenditure report submitted to the election commission.",politics,2819,56,70

Scientists make 3-atom-wide wire using smallest diamond bits,"Boston, Dec 27 (PTI) Scientists have used the smallest possible bits of diamonds to assemble electrical wires just three atoms wide, an advance that could pave the way for fabrics that generate electricity. By grabbing various types of atoms and putting them together LEGO-style, the new technique could potentially be used to build tiny wires for a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic devices that employ both electricity and light and superconducting materials that conduct electricity without any loss. ""What we have shown here is that we can make tiny, conductive wires of the smallest possible size that essentially assemble themselves,"" said Hao Yan, postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in the US. ""The process is a simple, one-pot synthesis. You dump the ingredients together and you can get results in half an hour. Its almost as if the diamondoids know where they want to go,"" said Yan. This animation shows molecular building blocks joining the tip of a growing nanowire. Each block consists of a diamondoid - the smallest bit of diamond - attached to sulphur and copper atoms. Like LEGO blocks, they only fit together in certain ways that are determined by their size and shape. The copper and sulphur atoms form a conductive wire in the middle, and the diamondoids form an insulating outer shell. Although there are other ways to get materials to self-assemble, this is the first one shown to make a nanowire with a solid, crystalline core that has good electronic properties, said Nicholas Melosh, from the US Department of Energys SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The needle-like wires have a semiconducting core - a combination of copper and sulphur known as a chalcogenide - surrounded by the attached diamondoids, which form an insulating shell. Their size is important because a material that exists in just one or two dimensions - as atomic-scale dots, wires or sheets - can have very different, extraordinary properties compared to the same material made in bulk, Melosh said. The new method allows researchers to assemble those materials with atom-by-atom precision and control. The diamondoids they used as assembly tools are tiny, interlocking cages of carbon and hydrogen. Found naturally in petroleum fluids, they are extracted and separated by size and geometry in a SLAC laboratory. For this study, the research team took advantage of the fact that diamondoids are strongly attracted to each other, through what are known as van der Waals forces. They started with the smallest possible diamondoids - single cages that contain just 10 carbon atoms - and attached a sulphur atom to each.",world,2647,60,70
Luxury shoe retailer Jimmy Choo puts itself up for sale,"The luxury shoe and bag retailer Jimmy Choo has put itself up for sale in a move that took the market by surprise.The retailer said it had ?decided to conduct a review of the various strategic options open to the company to maximise value for its shareholders? and that it was seeking offers for the business.The move was backed by the company?s independent directors and JAB Luxury, its majority shareholder with a stake of 68%.Shares in Jimmy Choo jumped 10% to a record high of 186.25p on the news, valuing the group at more than £720m. The company floated on the stock market in 2014 at a price of 140p a share, valuing it at about £550m.Any sale is expected to attract interest from strategic American buyers as well as Middle Eastern, Chinese and Russian bidders.The company was founded in London in 1996 by the Malaysian fashion designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. It runs 150 stores around the world, opening 10 last year as well as refitting 16 shops.It recently reported operating profits of £42.5m for 2016, up nearly 43%, after success with luxury trainers. Men?s shoes remain its fastest-growing category and account for 9% of revenue.The company has benefited from the drop in sterling since the EU referendum and is expanding in China. It has fared better than other luxury retailers such as Burberry, which were hit by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury purchases.JAB, an investment company owned by Germany?s billionaire Reimann family, wants to sell its stake in the shoes group to focus on food and other consumer goods. The family, one of Europe?s wealthiest business dynasties, has been building an empire of coffee brands and last year added Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to its portfolio. It also owns the US cosmetics brand Coty. Luxury investments make up less than 10% of JAB?s portfolio, and it plans to use the sale proceeds to take on the likes of Nestlé.A Euromonitor analyst said: ?Globally, retail sales of men?s designer footwear have grown marginally faster than women?s designer footwear over the last three years. So it is easy to see why Jimmy Choo has expanded into this male segment. Women?s luxury footwear still generates almost twice the retail value of men?s luxury footwear, though, and that disparity is unlikely to narrow significantly over the next decade.?But Jimmy Choo needs to be careful not to get ahead of itself. Remember what happened to Mulberry, another niche British luxury brand, when it drifted too far from its comfort zone? One year sales were soaring, the next they were dropping amidst a spate of profit warnings.?",business,2613,55,70

It was a ten minute narration, and the story focused on the vulnerabilities of the two characters Sultan and Shoaib. He didn?t even have a full script, but I was sold on the narration.

Scientists study human language evolution via apes,"London, Feb 9 (PTI) Scientists may have analysed almost 5,000 orangutan ""kiss squeaks"" - purse-lipped consonant-like calls that appear to convey different messages to understand how human ancestors formed their earliest words. Researchers from Durham University in UK spent years listening to the communication calls of one of our closest ape relatives. The team studied kiss squeaks in particular because, like many consonants they depend on the action of the lips, tongue and jaw rather than the voice. ""Kiss squeaks do not involve vocal fold action, so they are acoustically and articulatory consonant-like,"" said Reis e Lameira, from Durham University. The scientists recorded and analysed 4,486 kiss-squeaks recorded from 48 animals in four wild populations. They found that the animals embedded several different bits of information in their squeaks.

I guess once you make peace with that you just see what happens. I feel even in times when friends have to stand opposite each other, as long as there is communication there is understanding. If there is understanding, then you can still compete and come out with an even better relationship.

We are in a lot of ways diametrically opposite individuals but aligned towards the same objective. It's a given that the attempt is always (to achieve) a super hit. It is not easy which makes it fun. We agree that the film needs to have an emotional impact but the way to do (it) is where we will differ. Which is why there is a lot of hits and moulding. What we (finally) achieve is a balance of his and my world.So how do you differ?I would want the teardrop to fall. He won't wait for the cloud passing the setting sun. He will not care.

I'm so happy and surprised how three people (Hrithik, Rakesh Roshan and Sanjay Gupta), who are equally headstrong, were working in complete unison. There has never been a situation in the 60 days we shot the film (where we have disagreed). How did you prepare for the part of a visually-impaired man?Somehow it came quite naturally to me. I did rehearse and practise a lot. I had a blindfold on and learned the geography of my entire house. I learned instincts of how to anticipate if you are walking into a ditch or a wall. The reactions when you touch something that you didn't expect to be there. But that's my job. It is not something to boast about. I saw a lot of videos (of visually-impaired people). There was a blind person who came to meet me. He came alone. He had my home address on the phone and found it using the talkback feature. He had lunch with me. He did not spill the food. He was eating and laughing and cracking jokes. He came without a stick. That is when the entire stance of my character changed. I was going to play him as a handicapped person who is projecting a certain kind of neediness or helplessness so that he creates empathy and sympathy for him. That was the initial idea. I just scrapped it and played it exactly as who I am without any weight given to the fact that he is blind. You don't seem to be in a rush to have a film release a year.I actually have only done movies that I have wanted to do. If there were more films that I wanted to do, then I would have done them. What you tend to do is see it in perspective - he is being choosy or likes to do it at his own pace. Perhaps, I am looking for something that is a little rarer or I want to use my films to express my own self through my interpretations of my experiences. To find that is rare.",general,4034,57,70

Substance abuse is like a bad marriage: Prateik Babbar,"It took him five years and lot of courage to openly speak about his battle with drug addiction. After making a promising start in Bollywood, Prateik Babbar vanished from the limelight for a good five years. His absence might not have caught anybody's attention, but his return has grabbed many eyeballs. And why not?

On addiction He has come to terms with complications of his life and has fought the demons of substance abuse. It was last year when he first talked about his drug addiction, and in the last one year, he has been a ""work in progress"". ""Addiction is not a moral failing, it does not make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice. People still think I got hooked because it was 'cool' for a celebrity to indulge in recreational drugs. But for me, it was more of an escape from reality. My childhood was complicated and there were a lot of questions I didn't have answers to so I looked elsewhere for solace,"" said Prateik. On acceptanceIt took him a while to understand that he was an addict, and he needed to get out of it as soon as possible. ""Acceptance and speaking up can help change the face of addiction. It educates those who are ailing and tells others that the stereotype of people suffering is the exception rather than the rule. Acceptance is one of the first steps to recovery,"" added the actor. On coming outPrateik came out in open about his addiction as he didn't want to keep his fans in the dark. He wanted them to be aware of the dark truth of his life. ""I'm a fighter and criticism is not an option for me. Yes, one is entitled to his/her opinion and it's human to be judgmental but everyone deserves a second chance. The idea is to move on. I want to create awareness by showcasing the boy uninterrupted so the world doesn't get to see just one side of the story,"" said the 30-year-old actor. On recoveryIt has taken him a few years to get back to his normal life and he says that with each passing day, he is making an effort to better his life. He said, ""I'm still on the road to recovery but I'm proud to have turned over a new leaf. Substance abuse is like a bad marriage, even after you quit, it haunts you for a while till people start noticing the turnaround. I'm answerable to only my conscience. And yes, people take me more seriously now that I'm no longer the hippie rave but someone committed to fitness, auditions and family.""On his careerHe began his career with the 2008 film Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, and went onto bag a few promising roles in the subsequent years. However, it's been almost five years since Prateik has been seen on the big screen. But the actor is all set to bounce back. ""I'm looking for quality work and am not embarrassed to go out and ask for it. I'm also doing a lot of theatre with Jeff Goldberg because I believe it polishes your acting skills,"" he added.",general,3203,54,70

Women are doing better than men in B'wood: Masaan director,"Even as he agrees that one cannot deny the existence of nepotism in Bollywood, filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan, who bagged the National Award for his debut film Masaan, believes the issue has been blown ?out of proportion.??I think the issue (of nepotism) is overblown and has turned pointless now. I agree that we need acknowledge that it exists and there is a certain set of privileges that these actors enjoy. But beyond that, there isn?t much to say,? the filmmaker told Hindustan Times.Richa Chadha in a still from Masaan.Talking about his favourite actors, Neeraj said, ?Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor are two actors I would like to work with.

Time to teach India a bitter lesson: Chinese media,"A Wednesday editorial in a hardline Communist Party-run newspaper called for teaching India ""a bitter lesson"" and warned Delhi that a military conflict with China would inflict ""greater losses than in 1962"".With the State media keeping up its harsh rhetoric over the Doklam stand-off, the Global Times said in an editorial, referring to comments made by Defence Minister Arun Jaitley that India in 2017 was different from 1962 and Army Chief General Bipin Rawat saying India was ready for a two-and-a-half front war, ""If New Delhi believes that its military might can be used as leverage in the Donglang area, and it's ready for a two-and-a-half front war, we have to tell India that the Chinese look down on their military power. Jaitley is right that the India of 2017 is different from that of 1962 - India will suffer greater losses than in 1962 if it incites military conflicts.""The paper, which is published by the official People's Daily but known to reflect hardline views, added, ""We firmly believe that the face-off in the Donglang area will end up with the Indian troops in retreat. The Indian military can choose to return to its territory with dignity, or be kicked out of the area by Chinese soldiers.""The editorial was the harshest since the June 16 stand-off, which has seen almost daily statements from China's government and media blaming India for the ""trespass"". China has accused India of triggering the stand-off, which, however, began when the PLA constructed a road into Doklam, which is claimed by Bhutan but referred to as Donglang by China. INDIA INSTIGATING BHUTAN?The editorial echoed the view in China that India was ""instigating"" Bhutan to protest China's project. ""India is acting shamelessly before the international community,"" the editorial said. ""New Delhi's real purpose is to turn the Donglang area of China into a disputed region and block China's road construction there."" ""India should look in the mirror,"" it added. ""It was not able to refute the evidence of illegal border trespassing and coerced its small neighbour Bhutan to shoulder the blame. India has long treated Bhutan as a vassal state, a rare scene under modern international relations. India's illegal border intrusion is not allowed by international law; besides its suppression of Bhutan must be condemned by the international community. The Indian media claimed in recent days that New Delhi 'shouldn't abandon Bhutan.' India is humiliating the civilization of the 21st Century."" The paper said ""the Chinese public is infuriated by India's provocation"" and added it ""believes the Chinese People's Liberation Army is powerful enough to expel Indian troops out of Chinese territory.""INDIA'S UNRULY ACTIONS? Echoing what the Chinese envoy in Delhi said on Tuesday on China not making concessions, it said, ""New Delhi would be too naive to think that Beijing would make concessions to its unruly demands.""""We hope India can face up to the hazards of its unruly actions to the country's fundamental interests and withdraw its troops without delay,"" it said. ""We need to give diplomatic and military authorities full power to handle the issue. We call on Chinese society to maintain high-level unity on the issue. The more unified the Chinese people are, the more sufficient conditions the professionals will have to fight against India and safeguard our interests. This time, we must teach New Delhi a bitter lesson.""Another commentary in the newspaper authored by Yang Siling, vice director of the Institute for South Asian Studies at the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, said ""India instigated Bhutan to lodge a protest with China.""""Displaying toughness against China can help the ruling party score political points,"" wrote Yang. ""India dragging Bhutan into the latest border row was also meant to demonstrate that South Asia is India's strategic backyard and warn other South Asian countries not to side with China.""""Any wise politician could realise that China and India both gain from peaceful coexistence and lose from conflict. Unfortunately, Modi seemingly is more prone to seeking India's interests at the expense of China's,"" Yang added, saying ""the latest provocation will not be the last from India over the border issue"".",general,4240,50,70
2 AAP MLAs cross voted for Kovind in Delhi Assembly,"Besides four Bharatiya Janata Party legislators, there were two more in the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha who voted for Ramnath Kovind, the NDA-backed presidential candidate who emerged the winner on Thursday.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)?suspects the two MLAs who cross voted could be among the five suspended party legislators. Former water minister Kapil Mishra, who was suspended from the party in March for making corruption allegations against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, told Hindustan Times that he voted for the ?winning candidate?. ?It is obvious that one would vote for the winning candidate. I am glad that my vote got counted in the final result,? Mishra said on Thursday. Ahead of the polls, the AAP had announced its support to the opposition?s candidate Meira Kumar. Of the total 69 MLAs of Delhi, 67 -- 63 AAP, 4 BJP -- voted in the presidential polls on Monday. AAP had 67 MLAs initially. However, its strength reduced to 65?after one of its MLA,?Ved Prakash from Bawana joined the BJP?in March just before the municipal elections. The AAP lost the Rajouri Garden seat to BJP?s Manjinder Singh in the byelection. Despite the four votes from the BJP that went to Kovind, the former governor of Bihar who won with a landslide victory in the Presidential elections on Thursday, got a total of six votes --- which means that two AAP MLAs had cross-voted. Opposition?s candidate Meira Kumar, on the other hand, got 55 votes. Six votes were found invalid. The AAP, however, reacted to the voting pattern on positively and blamed the suspended MLAs for cross-voting. ?While we know for sure Kapil Mishra voted for Kovind, the other one must be some suspended MLA only,? said Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash. Bhardwaj was among the two MLAs who did not vote in the elections as he was out of town. Another MLA Devinder Sehrawat had stayed away from voting. ?It is in fact a proud moment for us that despite there being no whip, our MLAs voluntarily supported Ms Kumar and opposed those who propagate fundamentalism,? Bhardwaj said.Leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta said the election result indicates that dissent is simmering in AAP. ?Arvind Kejriwal is unable to keep his flock intact. He had to change his stand. In the beginning, the party had earlier announced to support Meira Kumar but Kejriwal later urged his legislators to vote according to their ?conscience?. What does it mean? He was sure that AAP MLAs could cross-vote. This shows clear insecurity in their leadership,? said the BJP leader.Gupta further added that victory of Kovind is a victory of India?s flourishing democracy. ?His victory has further strengthened our democratic system. I am confident under Kovind?s presidentship, the nation will march on road to progress with greater confidence and faith,? he said.",general,2870,51,70

Only one President of India elected without contest till now,"The voting for presidential election 2017 is underway and BJP pick Ram Nath Kovind is all set for a big win against Opposition candidate Meira Kumar. Of the total electoral college votes of 10,98,903, former Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind is almost assured of 63 per cent of them. Besides BJP's allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), parties like Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) and Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) have also pledged support to Kovind in the presidential election. Before the votes are counted and the next President of India is announced on July 20, we take a look at some of the biggest and closest victory margins recorded in previous presidential elections. SOME OF THE WINS BY BIGGEST MARGINS:1977: Following the sudden death of President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed in February 1977, election to the post had to be conducted within the next six months. A total of 37 candidates filed their nominations for the presidential election, but on scrutiny the Returning Officer rejected 36 of them. The only valid nomination was that of Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy. In July 1977, Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy was declared the new President of India. This was the first time a candidate was declared elected to the highest office without a contest. 1997: Two candidates were in the fray to succeed Shanker Dayal Sharma as the country's 11th president. They were K R Narayanan and T N Seshan. Narayanan won the presidential election with a huge margin and polled 9,56,290 votes against 50,631 votes for Seshan.1962: Before the second term of Rajendra Prasad expired, the election to choose his successor was held. Those in contention were Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Chowdhry Hari Ram and Yamuna Prasad Trisulia. Dr Radhakrishnan won the election with an overwhelming margin and got 5,53,067 votes while the other two candidates together managed to get nearly 10,000 votes. (The value of votes was then calculated on the basis of the 1951 Census.) 1957: Before the first presidential term of Rajendra Prasad concluded, the election to elect the second President of India was held. Rajendra Prasad was once again in the fray along with Chowdhry Hari Ram and Nagendra Narayan Das. Prasad polled 4,59,698 votes against 2,000 votes for Narayan Das and 2,672 votes for Hari Ram. Rajendra Prasad became the President of India for a second time.2002: When the election to chose K R Narayanan's successor was held, APJ Abdul Kalam won it with a huge margin. Kalam was the overwhelming favourite and got 9,22,884 votes against 1,07,366 votes polled by Lakshmi Sahgal. SOME OF THE CLOSE FIGHTS FOR PRESIDENT's POST:1969: Following the sudden demise of Dr Zakir Hussain in May 1969, then Vice President V V Giri took charge as the acting president. Two months later, Giri resigned from both the positions--vice-president and acting president--to contest the presidential election. Of the 15 candidates, Giri polled 4,01,515 votes, while Sanjeeva Reddy got 3,13,548 votes. However, none of the two candidates secured the number of votes required to be elected as President of India. That year, the quota for selection was fixed at 4,18,169 votes. After the first count, several candidates were excluded leaving only two people in the fray--V V Giri and N Sanjeeva Reddy. Eventually, Giri edged past the qouta mark with 4,20,277 votes while Reddy got 4,05,427 votes.V V Giri was declared elected to the post of India's president. 1967: Seventeen candidates were in the fray for the presidential election that would choose Dr Radhakrishnan's successor. While 9 of the 17 candidates polled zero votes, the fight was close between Dr Zakir Hussain and Kota Subbarao. While Subbarao got 3,63,971 votes, Hussain edged past him with 4,71,244 votes. Dr Zakir Hussain assumed the President's office on May 13, 1967.

Consumers complain of retailers charging GST on MRP,"It has been 10 days since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was rolled out at the stroke of midnight on July 1 but confusion about the indirect tax reform persists while complaints continue to pour in about traders charging GST unfairly.The consumers are raising their concern through various mechanism the government has floated including its Twitter handle @askGST_GoI and through online community 'Connected Consumers' run by Department of Consumer Affairs on social engagement platform LocalCircles.Many consumers have complained that some retailers are charging the GST over and above the MRP of products. The government has made it clear that the MRP is the maximum price of a product to be sold in retail and charging anything above this is an offence.FIRST, THE COMPLAINTSOne of the consumers shared a bill generated at popular restaurant at Noida in Uttar Pradesh. The invoice was generated two days after the GST was introduced. The restaurant charged central and state GSTs over and above a packet of snacks. A chemist in Mumbai charged GST on the total MRP of medicines purchased for patient Atul Shah. In this case, the computer generated bill does not show any GST, which was charged and mentioned in ink by the retailer.This overcharging of GST is not limited to local markets only. Even the online retailers and e-commerce portals are allegedly charging GST over and above MRP. One of the consumers produced a bill whose invoice was generated on July 4 for a can of edible oil priced at MRP Rs 380. After discount it was priced at Rs 371.43 but then inter-state GST was applied making the edible oil costlier than the MRP.In yet another case, a consumer reported buying a shirt from a popular e-commerce portal. After 60 per cent discount, the shirt was priced at Rs 720. This is the MRP for the shirt. But, an ""estimated GST"" of Rs 30.60 was added to it.A SURVEYIn a survey conducted by the LocalCircles, only 23 per cent consumers said that they were being charged only the MRP amount for products.About 51 per cent complained that they were being charged GST over and above MRP with or without discount. About 20 per cent of over 8,800 participants of the survey said that they got discount on MRP but were charged GST over and above that price.Interestingly, 26 per cent still had purchases without taking or asking for bills or receipts. The GST reform focuses a lot on invoice generated purchases.WHY CHARGING GST ON MRP ILLEGALUnder the Consumer Goods (Mandatory Printing of Cost of Production and Maximum Retail Price) Act 2006, maximum retail price (MRP) means the price above which a retailer cannot charge his consumers. The MRP already factors in all taxes levied on the product.A manufacturer is required to mention in clear and bold print the maximum retail price on all the products. A retailer is prohibited under the law to sell at a price higher than the MRP.In fact, the Consumer Affairs Department has led several campaigns telling consumers to bargain on the MRP as it covers good margin of profit that may range from 10-35 per cent.There are several laws including the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP Act), the Essential Commodities Acts and the Consumer Protection Act which make selling a product over and above MRP a punishable offence for unfair trade practice. Even under the new tax regime, selling a product over and above MRP is a violation of the anti-profiteering clauses of the GST Act. This may lead to cancellation of registration of the retailer.ALSO READ | GST: Will good and simple tax make traders honest?GST: A tax reform so huge that confusion was inevitableHave no fear, GST Rates Finder is here: Arun Jaitley launches mobile app that finds GST for you",general,3731,51,70
Kashmir integral part of Pakistan: PM Nawaz Sharif,"From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Jan 5 (PTI) Claiming that Kashmir was an ""integral part"" of Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today needled India yet again by praising slain Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a ""vibrant and charismatic leader"". Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a two-day international parliamentary seminar on Kashmir here, Sharif also praised the spirit and determination of the Kashmiri people for their struggle for the right to self-determination. ""Our hearts beat and sink with our Kashmiri brethren,"" Radio Pakistan quoted Sharif as saying. The world needs to tell India that ""enough is enough"" with regard to its policy towards Kashmir, he said, while asserting that Kashmir is an ""integral part"" of Pakistan. He claimed the ""martyrdom of vibrant and charismatic Kashmiri leader Burhan Wani has given a new turn to the Kashmiri movement"". He regretted the ""Indian aggression"" against Kashmiri people in the wake of protests triggered by the killing of Wani by security forces on July 8. Sharif said supporting the Kashmiri struggle for their right to self-determination is faith of every Pakistani. He said Pakistan will continue to extend moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their indigenous struggle and continue to shake the conscience of the international community for their rights. Sharif said Pakistan had sent special envoys to important countries to sensitise them about the situation in Kashmir. He said that he personally raised the dispute in his address to the UN General Assembly session. Referring to the four points he presented before the UN, Sharif once again urged the world community to make all out efforts for the realisation of the promise it made to the Kashmiri people seventy years ago. He said the UNSC resolutions should be implemented and the continued sufferings of Kashmiri people must come to an end now. Sharif while addressing a joint session of Parliament in October last year had praised Wani, drawing a strong reaction from India which said this shows Pakistans attachment to terrorism. He had also praised the militant during his address to the UN General Assembly on September 21, describing him as a ""young leader"". India had strongly criticised Sharifs speech at the UN, describing it as an act of ""self-incrimination"" by Pakistan.",general,2341,50,70
Australia to sell Kesar variety of Indian mango for 1st time,"From Natasha Chaku Melbourne, May 5 (PTI) For the first time, Australia will sell Kesar variety of Indian mangoes with the inaugural consignment of nearly 400 trays landing in Sydney, but marketing firms called it a ""little disappointing"" as the fruit was a little blemish and not evenly coloured. The first consignment was received by Perfection Fresh Australia (PFA), Australias largest fresh-produce marketing company, after recently revised protocols that allowed Indian mango imports if the fruit was treated with irradiation prior to export. ""The first consignment, Ive got to say, was a little disappointing,"" PFA chief executive Michael Simonetta said, adding ""the fruit had a little bit of blemish on the skin and wasnt as evenly coloured as we expected it to be, so were in the process now of getting it to colour more evenly and then offer it for sale following that."" ""The eating quality is quite nice. Its pleasant to eat. The feedback has been okay and the upside for me as a consumer is that it tastes better than the Mexican Keitt (mangoes) that are in the market as well at the moment,"" he said. Simonetta said the mangoes would predominantly end up with independent retailers. ""We have shown them to the major supermarkets, but at the moment the volumes are far too light. This is a trial and its yet to be concluded, so while Im a little bit underwhelmed, its too early to call."" The next consignment of Kesar mangoes will be sent to Perth next week while imports of Alphonso mangoes would also begin soon. ""The variety Im really excited about, is in a few weeks time well bring in the Alphonso mango which is known as the king of mango,"" he said. ""Its got a very high profile in India and across the world and I think the whole programme of importation of mangoes from India will be judged on the success or otherwise of the Alphonso mango."" Simonetta said it was too early to tell how many tonnes would be exported to Australia this season. ""My hope is that we can bring into the country a good tasting mango, which the Alphonso is, counter-seasonally to supplement the mango lovers desire for fruit in the Australian off-season,"" he said. ""The trade will be judged fairly and squarely, wholly and solely by the Australian consumer. If the consumer tells us they like this mango and there is a need for it then well bring it in, if they tell us otherwise then well follow their lead.""",general,2406,60,70

Mumbai man booked for Facebook post against Bal Thackeray,"The Kandivli police booked a man on Thursday for hurting religious sentiments over a comment he made on Facebook against Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. While Ahmed Shaikh, a resident of a slum in Kandivli, has not been arrested, he was charged based on a complaint by one Lalsingh Rajpurohit, a builder. In his complaint to the police, Rajpurohit said he noticed Shaikh?s derogatory comment on a friend?s Facebook post expressing outrage over the Amarnath yatra terror attack. While his friend had put a photo of Thackeray and written a post praising the late leader?s stand against terrorism, Shaikh commented with abuses.

Delhi to get 10 more pollution monitoring stations,"The national capital will have 10 more pollution monitoring stations before next winter to help area-wise micro handling of its air quality which, according to a WHO assessment, is the worst among world?s top cities.Subsequently, another 10 stations will be set up as part of a plan to have at least three such monitoring points in each of the Delhi districts, government sources said on Friday.The new stations will be located in areas such as Greater Kailash, Defence Colony, Vasant Kunj, Qutub Institutional Area, Okhla, Najafgarh, and Paschim Vihar, among others.The air pollution data in the capital is currently taken from 28 monitoring stations . (HT?Graphics) The air pollution data in the capital is currently taken from 28 monitoring stations ? four run by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), eight operated by the MeT department and the rest by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).To check pollution levels in your city, click hereThe decision to install more stations comes after the Supreme Court approved the CPCB?s ?graded response action plan?, notified last week and enforced partially on Friday. The plan outlines measures based on air quality ? moderate to poor, very poor, severe, and severe-plus or emergency. A separate set of action plan has been suggested for each category.The top court in December last year had asked authorities to install real-time and manual pollution monitoring stations in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to check air quality for the graded response.According to the SC-approved graded action plan, the entire national capital region (NCR) will be treated as one. Authorities and experts have warned that the landlocked city?s air quality cannot improve unless adequate measures are taken in the whole of NCR, which involves territories governed by neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan.A Delhi government official said the process to have 20 more fixed monitoring stations in place has started, and the tendering procedure is expected to start in February.?A bid manager has already been appointed for the tendering process. These monitoring stations will help us get a comprehensive picture of air pollution in Delhi, especially during winter, when the city?s air quality worsens. We want to ensure that each Delhi district has at least three stations,? the official told Hindustan Times.The city of about 20 million people has been struggling to clean up its air that contains a toxic cocktail of dust, smoke and gases from vehicle and factory exhausts. The condition worsens every autumn and winter as the city, buffeted by farmers burning crop stalks in neighbouring states and atmospheric changes, records higher levels of air pollution.?In a big city like Delhi, the air quality is not the same at various points. For example, Anand Vihar with high volume of vehicular traffic is one of the most polluted corners of the city while at Jor Bagh in the heart of the city the pollution levels are well under control,? an environment department official told Hindustan Times, underlining the need for an area-wise micro monitoring of the air quality.?More monitoring stations will help us in a thorough understanding of the nature of pollution in various parts of the city,? he said.In a meeting called by Environment Pollution Control and Prevention Authority (EPCA) on Friday, it was stated that Haryana will get 34 stations, Uttar Pradesh 16, while Rajasthan is eyeing 11 monitoring spots in the next nine months.A fixed-automatic station where air pollutants like Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), PM2.5 and PM10 are being monitored regularly, costs Rs 1.2 crore with 10% yearly operation and maintenance cost, a CPCB official said.Also read |?Air pollution: Piecemeal solutions won?t end a problem that?s hurting India?s economy",general,3844,50,70
China blacklists Winnie the Pooh after comparisons with Prez,"Has Winnie the Pooh done something to anger China?s censors? Some mentions of AA Milne?s loveable but slow-witted bear with a weakness for honey have been blocked on Chinese social networks.Authorities did not explain the clampdown, but the self-described ?bear of very little brain? has been used in past memes comparing him to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.Posts bearing the image and the Chinese characters for Winnie the Pooh were still permitted on the Weibo social media platform on Monday. But comments referencing ?Little Bear Winnie? ? Pooh?s Chinese name ? turned up error messages saying the user could not proceed because ?this content is illegal?.Winnie the Pooh stickers have also been removed from WeChat?s official sticker gallery, but user-generated gifs of the bear are still available on the popular messaging app.Comparisons between Xi and Pooh first emerged in 2013, after Chinese social media users began circulating pictures of Pooh and his slender tiger friend Tigger beside a photograph of Xi walking with Barack Obama, the US president at the time.In 2014, a photograph of Xi shaking hands with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was matched with an image of Pooh gripping the hoof of his gloomy donkey friend Eeyore.In 2015, the political analysis portal Global Risk Insights said a picture of Xi standing up through the roof of a parade car paired with an image of a Winnie the Pooh toy car was ?China?s most censored photo? of the year.China?s ruling Communist party is highly sensitive to comical depictions of its leader, particularly as Xi attempts to consolidate power ahead of a key party congress later this year.

Why're people questioning Akshay's N'tnl award: Priyadarshan,"Priyadarshan, the chairperson of the feature film section for the National Film Awards, said he does not understand why people are questioning Akshay Kumar's Best Actor award. The filmmaker has collaborated with Akshay Kumar in films like Hera Pheri, Garam Masala, Bhagam Bhaag, Bhool Bhulaiya, De Dana Dan and Khatta Meetha. Many in social media are attributing Akshay's win to his close proximity to Priyadarshan. But the director says last year Ramesh Sippy was head of the jury and none questioned his good friend Amitabh Bachchan's Best Actor win, so why should he and Akshay be subjected to such allegations. ""I have heard of all that and I will answer it in a simple way. When Ramesh Sippy was jury head Amitabh Bachchan won. When Prakash Jha was head of jury, Ajay Devgan won. None questioned at that time. So why all these questions are cropping up today,"" Priyadarshan told PTI. The filmmaker also clarified that Akshay's performance in Rustom and Airlift were considered by the jury during the selection process. However, as only the name of one film could be mentioned, the list featured the courtroom drama Rustom, he said. ""Akshay was given the best actor on the basis of his performance in two films -- Airlift and Rustom. It was the jury's decision. One performance was dramatic and one was realistic. But according to the rule book, only one film can be mentioned and Rustom was mentioned in the list. But the award recognises his performance in both the movies,""said Priyadarshan.This year saw the dominance of regional cinema at the National Film Awards with Marathi film Kasaav winning best feature film, Surabhi CM getting best actress and Rajesh Mapuskar being named best director for Marathi movie Ventilator. Bollywood films which managed to score are Pink (Best Film on Social Issues), Dhanak (Best Children's Film) and Neerja (Best Hindi Film). Priyadarshan says regional films don't chase after box office numbers and that is why they are true to their stories and also give social messages. ""While watching films we realised that a lot of Bollywood movies were themed around homosexuality. The movies are not really highlighting social problems. Whereas regional cinema are themed around fantastic social issues. They try to tell different stories. Even Dangal doesn't talk about social issues. It was a life story,"" said Priyadarshan. ""Regional movies are not made with the aim to earn Rs 100 crore. They are made from the heart. We should promote films that reflect the Indian culture. Regional movies are doing a very good job of storytelling through social issues,"" he said.|| Read more ||Priyadarshan's reason why Akshay won National Award over Aamir is bizarreAkshay Kumar and Sonam Kapoor on National Award win: Who would have thought!!National Film Awards 2017: Akshay Kumar wins Best Actor for Rustom, Shivaay wins Best VFX award",general,2866,60,70
"Raj newborn declared dead, starts crying before cremation","In Rajasthan's Bundi district, a shocking incident shed some light on the sad state of affairs of the health department. A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground. All this happened in the absence of a doctor. Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. But few minutes before the burial the child started crying and that's when everyone realised that the baby girl is still alive. They again went to the hospital and complained against the male nurse who misguided them. When the deputy superintendent saw a ruckus, he went on to defend the nurse and said that since the child is born weak, there are hardly any chances of survival. He in fact did not even try saving the newborn's life.Residents of Bundi district are appalled by this incident of negligence and questioned the hospital authorities that if the infant had not cried before the burial then because of the wrong information given to them, the family would have buried her alive. Not only that, deliveries being done in the absence of doctors raises many questions about the functioning of the hospital. Deputy controller Dr OP Verma defended his staff and said that the baby girl was born premature and since there was no movement at the time of birth, she was declared dead. However, the family members believe that if immediately after delivery the infant would have been shifted to the ICU then her health would not have deteriorated.",health,1614,57,70

Explain source of wealth or Tejashwi must quit: JD(U) to RJD,"The rift in Bihar?s ruling ?grand alliance? appeared to have widened as the Janata Dal (United) said on Friday that deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav should resign if his family fails to explain the source of funding for properties mired in an alleged scam.The JD(U)?s demand, dismissed by RJD chief Lalu Prasad, followed efforts by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to broker truce among the two allies.Chief minister Nitish Kumar?s JD(U) rules the state with the RJD and Congress, which together defeated the BJP in the 2015 assembly election.But RJD-JD(U) ties were strained after Prasad and his 26-year-old younger son, Tejashwi, were named in a land-for-hotels scandal, and the CBI raided their homes and other properties last week. The alleged scam is from Prasad?s stint as railway minister from 2004 to 2009.The RJD chief, who was in Ranchi attending a fodder scam trial, snapped at a media contingent eager to know of his next move.?Tejashwi was elected by the people, not by those asking for his resignation,? he said. His son had said he won?t step down.Prasad returned to Patna with a court waiver of the hearing on Saturday and met top RJD leaders at his 10 Circular Road home to finalise the next step.Congress president Gandhi spoke to chief minister Kumar to find a middle path to defuse the crisis and dispatched the party?s state chief Ashok Choudhary to play mediator.The JD(U) stuck to its stand and party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar compared assets of the chief minister and Prasad.?Nitish Kumar?s assets are known to the world, but on the other hand, what have you?? he asked Prasad.He said the RJD chief, his wife and former chief minister Rabri Devi, sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, and three daughters, including Rajya Sabha parliamentarian Misa Bharati, are charged with benami deals. But the family has not given any ?satisfactory? explanation.?They must come clear and spell out the source of income,? he said. ?The RJD owes it to the people and allies to issue a point by point rebuttal to the CBI charges and come clean on the allegations, or else, Tejashwi must resign.?Read |?Tejashwi Yadav won?t resign, Grand Alliance in Bihar unbreakable, says?Lalu PrasadThe JD(U), however, kept a window open to salvage the alliance as it didn?t specify a time limit for its partner to declare its funding source for the family properties that are under the scanner.?Why should we spell out a deadline? We will take appropriate action at the right time,? Neeraj Kumar said.The spat has reached a critical point as several JD(U) leaders suggested the party won?t accept ?half-measures? and would sever the alliance if needed.On Thursday, JD(U) state president Basishtha Narain Singh asked the RJD to explain its position on the deputy chief minister.The party is worried as any fresh scam taint on the RJD could splash back on chief minister, who has the image of an honest, untainted politician and pursues a policy of ?zero tolerance? against crime and corruption. Kumar?s image is his and the JD(U)?s biggest asset.Read |?Where?s the proof??Tejashwi Yadav hits back over tax noticeRJD leaders said Tejashwi?s resignation could be a possibility, but may not be immediate as it could reflect as an admission of guilt.?The party also toyed with the idea of fully withdrawing all ministers from the Nitish cabinet, should Tejashwi resign,? said a party leader, who didn?t wish to be named.Sources said the party will then lend outside support to the JD(U) to run the government and deny the BJP any political space.

Are you a virgin? Bihar medical institute asks its employees,"In a ridiculous step, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna has asked its employees to declare whether they are virgin. The marriage declaration form which has come to light is applicable for hospital employees and freshly recruited doctors and nursing staffs. The form also asks male employees to provide details if they have more than one wife.Women employees apart from declaring status regarding their virginity have also been asked to provide details on whether she is married to a person who has no other wife living or another wife living. Speaking to India Today, the Deputy Medical Superintendent, Dr Manish Mandal said that the marriage declaration form with the contentious questions have been in practice ever since the institute was established in 1984.""Everyone has to fill this form which is part of Central Services Rules and this form is similar to what AIIMS in Delhi uses. If the Centre or AIIMS changes the format of the form in the future, we will also change it. This is not a new form and has been in practice since 1984 when IGIMS was established"", said Mandal. Elaborating on the need to extract personal details like one's virginity, Dr Mandal said that the questions have been asked in order to avert any kind of wrong doing. ""In the Central Services Rules there is a provision that when a person joins the service and later on if she dies because of any eventuality, there may be a claimant or boy friend who may come to seek job in place of the victim"", said Dr Mandal . However, Dr Mandal admitted that the use of word virginity was incorrect.""Essentially what is being asked in the form is whether a person is married or unmarried? Personally I feel the word used should have been unmarried instead of virgin. That would have been sober but what is there in the rules have to be followed,"" said Dr Mandal.",science,1865,60,70

"After 9 months, Delhi had 'good' air day yesterday","After a nine-month gap, Delhi breathed ?good? air on Thursday.

When AQI is below 100, the air quality is considered good and air pollution poses little or no risk. On Friday, too, the AQI is expected to be 85 and it is likely to remain in the same range for the next one week.According to experts, the decrease in pollution levels in the is due to the rainy season in North India. ?Even though it is not raining in Delhi at the moment, in surrounding areas it is pouring down. Because of this, long range transport of pollutants from outside Delhi is minimal. Around 20%-30% pollution gets reduced because of this,? SAFAR chief Gufran Beig told HT.?Because of the monsoon, there is lot of moisture in the air. This is also another reason for this decreasing pollution levels over the past 2-3 weeks,?

The satisfactory range falls between 50-100. ?We were expecting the result to be ?good? but three monitoring stations, Anand Vihar, ITO and Delhi College of Engineering in Bawana, which are heavy traffic zone, ruined the results. The air quality was good in the city on Thursday as mixing height was higher compared to other days,? Dr Dipankar Saha, additional director and head of the Air Laboratory at the CPCB told HT.According to him, the weather conditions, which is not too hot and on the cooler side, also aided in the good air quality.The 24-hour rolling average of PM10 and PM2.5 were recorded at 77 and 44?g/m3 respectively on Thursday, according to SAFAR.

Wasn't making fun of anyone: Taapsee on K Raghavendra remark,"Actor Taapsee Pannu has made her name in Bollywood with hard-hitting roles in Pink (2016) and Naam Shabana, but it was quite different in her debut film, Jhummandi Naadam (2010), directed by K. Raghavendra Rao, a legend of Telugu cinema.The actor has been roundly bashed on social media for referring to Rao?s penchant for ?showing [the heroine?s] midriff and throwing fruits and flowers at it?, in a chat with the comedy group East India Comedy. This was said as part of Taapsee?s anecdote about her first film, but this got angry fan reactions like ?ungrateful?, a ?hypocrite? and a ?backstabber? for supposedly forgetting her roots and taking a dig at such a veteran.Talking to Hindustan Times, Taapsee says, ?Er, what did I take a dig at? He?s known for that. I have stated a fact, and if you?re taking it in a derogatory manner, that?s your problem.? She says, ?Trust me, him or me, both of us are really unperturbed by whatever I have said, because I?ve seen the video and he has seen it, too, along with his family, and we are all laughing at it.?Maintaining that she didn?t say anything ?disrespectful? about anyone, Taapsee quips that the only person she ?disrespected or made fun of? in the entire chat video was herself. In it, she had said, ?...When my turn came, maybe because my midriff wasn?t quite ready, they threw a coconut on me! I don?t know what is so sensuous about a coconut hitting my midriff!?She tells us, ?And I still stand by all of that. Whatever I mentioned there was not to make fun of anyone expect me, and it was purely on the basis of facts. I didn?t say anything derogatory or disrespectful to anyone.

Railway Ministry plans integrated ticketing system,"The railway ministry plans to introduce its ambitious integrated ticketing system in the next three years and Mumbai will be the first city to experience it. The project will be implemented in the city on a pilot basis and if it?s successful, it will be introduced in other metro cities. Primarily a Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) project, the system will integrate all public transport ? BEST buses, local trains, metros, black-and-yellow taxis and autorickshaws. The ministry hopes that more than 80 % of the city?s suburban commuters will opt for the all-in-one tickets. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) and Central and Western Railway officials are currently studying different ways to sync the new software with the existing system. The project will be executed in two stages: in the first, the software will be integrated with the existing ticketing system and in the second, entry and exit gates will be installed at stations. Railway authorities also hope the new ticketing system will reduce losses as it will need less manpower. The railway panel?s findings will be submitted to MMRDA and the railway board in August. ?MRVC will present the railways? perspective to the MMRDA, which is the primary organisation for the integrated ticketing system,? said Prabhat Sahai, chairman and MD, MRVC.Sources said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is keen on the project. The Brihamumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), which runs bus services, and Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL), which manages the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro, have agreed to modify their ticketing systems for the new tickets.

"Man arrested for raping, molesting teenage sisters","A 22-year-old man was arrested on Sunday for allegedly sexually assaulting his two minor sisters. The incident was reported from west Delhi?s Tilak Nagar on Sunday.The man, police said, had been assaulting the girls for the past one year. The father of the girls passed away two years ago and their mother, who has cancer, is bedridden.According to the police, he allegedly raped his 17-year-old sister in April last year and molested his 13-year-old sister around the same time. He allegedly sexually abused them whenever he got a chance.?The mother had no idea about her son sexually abusing her daughters. She had given the 22-year-old the responsibility to take care of the two girls,? a police officer said.When questioned, the mother told police that the girls would often refuse to go to the school or tuition with their brother but they never shared any details with her.DCP West, Vijay Kumar, confirmed the incident. ?We have registered a case of rape against the youth and have arrested him. He is being questioned. The investigation in the case is on,? he said.The matter came to fore after the 13-year-old shared her ordeal with her friend, whose father works with an NGO. The friend?s father then approached the police and lodged a formal complaint. In her complaint, the 13-year-old said that the brother terrorized her and her sister. She alleged that he would always look for an opportunity to touch them inappropriately, sometimes outside the house and mostly late at night when everyone was asleep. He allegedly even threatened to throw them out of the house if they dared to complain.?Luckily, the girl shared the episode with her friend who convinced her to narrate it to her father assuring that he would help. The girl said that she did not know who to approach as the 22-year-old claimed to be the owner of the house and she thought that if she complained to her mother, she would not believe her. Based on the complaint, a case was registered and the girls have been rescued. They will now record their statements before the magistrate under 164 CrPc,? an investigator said.",general,2098,50,70

Australia's pace attack could decide Ashes series: Brett Lee,"Australia's pace attack, emboldened by the return of ""once in a generation"" bowler Pat Cummins, could prove the difference between the sides in this year's Ashes series against England, feels former paceman Brett Lee.Steve Smith's side already boast tearaway paceman Mitchell Starc along with the precision of Josh Hazlewood.Cummins returned to Test cricket in India after more than five years in the wilderness, replacing injured spearhead Starc and taking eight wickets from the final two matches in Ranchi and Dharamsala.His successful comeback has only bolstered Australia's already formidable pace resources.""What Pat Cummins can bring is pace, aggression, control and anything between that. He is a once in a generation bowler and you have got to harness that amazing talent,"" Lee said in an interview at a Mumbai hotel overlooking the Arabian Sea.The 23-year-old right-armer showed good control and generated enough pace even on the docile surfaces in India to trouble the hosts' batsmen.James Pattinson has also been in stellar form in domestic cricket since returning from a 12-month injury layoff in February and the 26-year-old could complete a dream pace quartet for the five-match Ashes series starting in November.Lee, an ambassador for Bowling Master, said he would struggle to summon the courage to face such a pace battery.""I would be (scared), absolutely,"" Lee said after launching the cricket training kit which will be sold on Amazon's India portal.""It's a pretty serious pace barrage that you've got. Australian bowling stocks now are pretty healthy.""Hazlewood is more of hitting the good length, day in and day out. With Starc you will be full, short, good length, yorkers, the whole thing.""Two completely different bowlers but complementing each other because they are building pressure from each end.

China will never allow anyone to take away territory: Prez,"(Eds: Updating with fresh quotes) By K J M Varma Beijing, Aug 1 (PTI) China will never seek ""aggression or expansion"" but will not allow anyone to ""split its territory"", President Xi Jinping asserted today as he lauded the Armys strong resolve to protect the countrys sovereignty and defeat ""all invasions"" amid territorial disputes with its neighbours. ""No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests,"" Xi said as the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is engaged in a standoff with Indian troops at Doklam in the Sikkim section since mid-June. Though there was no direct reference to the Sikkim standoff, Xi urged the PLA to focus on war preparedness to forge an elite and powerful force that is always ""ready for the fight, capable of combat and sure to win"". ""There are various means and choices to safeguard peace and security and prevent war, but military means should remain the final guarantee,"" he said. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the ceremony to mark the 90th founding anniversary of the 2.3 million strong PLA, the worlds largest standing army. He said China would never allow ""any people, organisation or political party to split any part of Chinese territory out of the country at any time, in any form."" ""The Chinese people love peace. We will never seek aggression or expansion, but we have the confidence to defeat all invasions,"" Xi, 64, said at the ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People attended by Premier Li Keqiang and other top leaders of the ruling Communist Party and army officials. This is the second time in three days that Xi spoke of the PLAs capability to thwart invasions. On July 30, Xi during a massive PLA parade had said, ""I firmly believe that our gallant military has both confidence and ability to defeat all invading enemies"". His remarks came in the midst of a massive official media campaign and assertion by Chinas foreign and defence ministries accusing Indian troops of trespassing into Chinese territory at Doklam. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval during the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa NSAs meet here on July 27- 28 also held separate talks with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi. Both the countries are tight-lipped about the outcome of Doval-Yang talks. China is also engaged in a number of maritime disputes with its neighbours like Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam in the East and South China seas. Beijing also threatens to use force against arch-rival Taiwan if negotiations fail to reunify the island with the mainland. In his speech today, Xi called for new generation of ""capable, brave and virtuous"" army ""with souls"" in order to build a strong military. He reiterated that the PLA should function under the CPC leadership, highlighting that its sole command is the party leadership not the government like elsewhere in the world. The PLA should firmly safeguard the CPCs leadership and the socialist system, protect national sovereignty, security and development interests as well as regional and world peace, he said. The life of the military personnel lies in combat ability, he said, urging the PLA to strengthen its awareness of being prepared for any eventualities. ""All thoughts must be put on combat, and all work should focus on combat so the military can assemble, charge forward and win any time the party and the people need them to,"" he said.",general,3533,58,70

US Press Secy wishes India '70th independence anniversary',"India celebrates 70 years of freedom this August 15, but White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has wasted no time to wish our country and its citizens. Addressing his daily press briefing, Spicer was asked about the upcoming Donald Trump-Narendra Modi meeting at the White House. In response, Spicer said that he'd first like to ""wish the people of India a happy 70th anniversary on their independence.""The question, asked by a reporter identified only as 'Goyal', was about the expectations from Trump and Modi's June 26 meeting in Washington, DC. The two leaders are meeting for the first time; notably, Modi will become the first world leader with whom Donald Trump sits down for a working dinner. Answering the question, Spicer said President Trump and Prime Minister Modi will ""discuss ongoing cooperation, including counter-terrorism, defense partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, global cooperation, burden-sharing, trade, law enforcement, and energy. I think it's going to be a very robust discussion."" PM Modi has already left for his US visit, which includes a stopover in Portugal today. Modi will arrive in the United States on Sunday and will meet Trump on Monday. Spicer's comment on wishing India on its independence was not followed up by a reporter's comment, so it remains unclear whether the press secretary was merely wishing India in its 70th independent year.Here is the full exchange (courtesy the White House) where Spicer speaks about the Trump-Modi meet and wishes India (the full transcript of Spicer's briefing can be found here): ""Q Take one question, Sean?MR. SPICER: I know because Goyal has got a visit coming on Monday, so he gets a question on Friday.Q Thank you, sir. Two questions. MR.

SPICER: Better get ready.Q -- face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi. So is President Trump ready to accept him and welcome him, because both have the same dream? Prime Minister Modi is saying ""Make in India,"" and President Trump is saying ""Buy American,"" and make in America -- or ""Hire American."" So my question is, so much is there on the plate when Prime Minister Modi arrives here. He's saying that he will have a great meeting with the President because we have many things in common, as far as US-India relations are concerned. So what can we expect between the two leaders?MR. SPICER: Well, first, I want to wish the people of India a happy 70th anniversary on their independence. But during the meeting, the President and the Prime Minister will discuss ongoing cooperation, including counter-terrorism, defense partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, global cooperation, burden-sharing, trade, law enforcement, and energy. I think it's going to be a very robust discussion.Q And a separate question, please --MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q Thank you. On Wednesday, June 21st was the International Day of Yoga, which was declared by the United Nations three years ago under the leadership -- initiative by Prime Minister Modi. Any citation you think President Trump will issue? Or what he has -- any message as far as yoga is concerned? Because yoga means less trips to the doctors and hospitals. MR.

But Mahajan declined to suspend the question hour.At this, Congress and Trinamool Congress lawmakers rushed to the well and shouted slogans against the government.The Speaker warned the MPs repeatedly to maintain decorum, but the protests grew as Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) members joined the protesters.?Minorities, Dalits and women are being targeted in the name of cow slaughter.

Citing the 1890 convention which fixes the India-China-Bhutan trijunction at Gipmochi, far south of where India and Bhutan do, the Foreign Ministry said the ""illegal trespass of border troops goes against convention and is against basic principles of the UN Charter and international laws"".""The action taken by India is undoubtedly a betrayal of consistent position held by India,"" said Geng, adding that ""Prime Minister Nehru explicitly recognised the 1890 convention between Tibet and Sikkim"" in a March 22, 1959 letter to then Chinese PM Zhou Enlai.India maintains the 1890 agreement only provides the basis of alignment of the boundary, and that the border needs to be finalised by the Special Representatives in maps and on the ground.NEHRU'S LETTER READIn the letter Geng cited, Nehru wrote that ""The boundary of Sikkim, a protectorate of India, with the Tibet Region of China was defined in the Anglo- Chinese Convention 1890 and jointly demarcated on the ground in 1895.""However, in the same letter, Nehru also mentioned agreements on the boundaries in Ladakh and Arunachal, which China now rejects.In fact, in the very same section of the letter, Nehru mentioned the following two agreements: ""The Ladakh Region of the State of Jammu and Kashmir- A treaty of 1842 between Kashmir on the one hand and the Emperor of China and Lama Guru of Lhasa on the other, mentions the India-China boundary in the Ladakh region. In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.""On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: ""The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention.""

This includes 111 Maoists in 2017 (till date). 205 surrenderees have already been enrolled as Special Home Guards.

Indira Gandhi's name removed from Oxford India Centre,"A centre established by Somerville college in the University of Oxford in 2013 with a £3 million grant from India and named after Indira Gandhi has seen the name of the former prime minister dropped after the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014.The Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development (OICSD) was named the Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development at its launch during the tenure of the Manmohan Singh government. Gandhi, an alumnus of the college, studied Modern History there in 1937.The memorandum of understanding to set up the centre was signed in May 2013 after then minister for human resources development MM Pallam Raju visited the college. The Indian grant of £3 million was matched by the University of Oxford.An ?Education Brief? of the Indian government dated December 1, 2016 suggests the name was changed during the year. College officials, however, told Hindustan Times there had been no pressure or suggestion from New Delhi to change the name. The brief states: ?The Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development (IGCSD), established at the College with Government of India providing seed money of Rs 25 crore (GBP 3 million) ? has begun work. ?The Centre is now called Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development (OICSD). The Centre would be housed in a new building on Oxford University?s Redcliff Observatory Quarter adjacent to Somerville College. The Centre would be fully established in time for the centenary celebrations of Smt Gandhi?s birth on November 19, 1917.? Asked about the change of name, Alice Prochaska, principal of the college, said: ?We have committed to use our ?best endeavours? to set up an ?inspirational research facility?, ie an Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development, in a building on our site, and we are using our best endeavours to achieve the funding for a building that will indeed house the Indira Gandhi Centre. ?The prestigious building is a long-term plan and if we achieve it, will be larger than only the IG Centre but will include the IG Centre. The overall building could be named for the donor. While these plans are evolving, we are using the overarching name of the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development for the current activity, which includes the Indira Gandhi Scholars and programme.? Gandhi visited the college in 1971 to receive an honorary doctorate. In 2002, Congress president Sonia Gandhi presented a portrait of the former prime minister, which hangs alongside a painting of Margaret Thatcher, another alumnus of the college. The centre with the new name is seen as part of ?An historic Oxford-India Partnership?. The college describes it thus: ?The OICSD advances India?s sustainable development by bringing different academic disciplines and sectors together.?It adds, ?We develop future leaders by supporting exceptional Indian scholars to study at Oxford; we carry out multidisciplinary research on sustainable nutrition, the environment and health; and we translate academic ideas to the ground.?In November 2016, the college celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Nashik-born Cornelia Sorabji (1866-1954), the first Indian woman student at Oxford who went on to become the first Indian woman lawyer in colonial India.",general,3264,53,70

The PLA Daily?s report suggested the gear was moved after the face-off began.The reports did not say whether China moved the equipment to support military drills held in Tibet, including in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river, close to the border of India?s northeastern states, or for other reasons.Sources in the security establishment in New Delhi said there was ?no unusual military movement? in China during the past two months. The sources also said China had been conducting military exercises in the Tibet region since 2009. Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military commentator, suggested to SCMP the movement of military equipment was most likely related to the standoff and could have been designed to bring India to the negotiating table.?Diplomatic talks must be backed by military preparation,? he said.Wang Dehua, from the South Asia Studies Centre at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said the scale of the troop and equipment movement showed how much easier it is for China to defend its western borders.?Military operations are all about logistics,? he told SCMP. ?Now there is much better logistics support to the Tibet region.?Beijing has accused New Delhi of ?illegal trespass? in Donglang sector and said the withdrawal of Indian troops is a must for resolving the face-off and opening talks.Donglang is under the control of Beijing but the area at the strategic tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China is claimed by Thimphu.India has said the road being built by the Chinese troops has serious security implications and will alter the status quo in the region.Earlier this week, state-run CCTV beamed footage of PLA troops from a mountain brigade engaged in a military exercise with live ammunition in the Tibet region. The location of the drill was not far from the Donglang and the state-run media reported that troops which were involved were ?responsible for frontline combat missions?.The live-fire drills included the ?quick delivery of troops and different military units working together on joint attacks?, the state media reported. The troops also carried out anti-aircraft defence drillsOther media reports said Tibet?s mobile communication agency had conducted a drill in Lhasa on July 10 during which personnel practiced the setting up of a temporary mobile network ?to secure communications in an emergency?.",world,3840,53,70

'Transformers' actor hurls insults at cops arresting him,"Videos released by Savannah, Georgia, police on Tuesday of Shia LaBeouf?s arrest last week on charges of disorderly conduct and public intoxication shows the actor hurling expletive-filled barbs at officers as he questioned the reason for his arrest.The Transformers actor, 31, was arrested in the lobby of his Savannah hotel on charges of disorderly conduct and public intoxication in the early hours of Saturday, police said.Four videos from police bodycams released by the Savannah Chatham Metropolitan Police Department show LaBeouf questioning why he was being arrested as he was handcuffed. ?I have rights, I?m an American, you got me in my hotel, arresting me in my hotel, for doing what sir?? LaBeouf says in a raised voice. The police officer arresting LaBeouf is heard telling the actor, ?I?ll fix your cuffs if you calm down.? Representatives for LaBeouf did not respond to Reuters? requests for comment on his arrest video. The incident occurred after LaBeouf approached a bystander and a police officer to ask for a cigarette, and when he wasn?t given one, he ?became disorderly, using profanities and vulgar language in front of the women and children present,? police said. He became aggressive toward the officer when asked to leave, police added, and when the officer tried to arrest LaBeouf, he ran into a hotel lobby.

"Net neutrality, facepalm added to Merriam-Webster Dictionary","Washington, Feb 8 (PTI) FLOTUS, face-palm, net neutrality along with terms from recent advances in science - such as CRISPR - are among over 1,000 new words added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary for the first time since 2014. The new entries include borrowings from foreign languages as well as words from tech, medicine, pop culture, sports. ""The work of revision is ongoing and constant; even though it seems that the latest slang gets the most attention when dictionaries issue lists of new words, the additions come from the whole range of registers and from every corner of the language,"" the Merriam-Webster Dictionary said in its blog. ""These are words that have demonstrated frequent and increasing use in a variety of sources, and are therefore likely to be encountered by a reader - and should be in the dictionary,"" it said. In some cases, terms have been observed for years and are finally being added; in others, the fast rise and broad acceptance of a term has made for a quicker journey. Seussian relating to or suggestive of the works of Dr Seuss is now in the online dictionary, along with conlang - an invented language like Klingon - and prosopagnosia (an inability to recognise faces). New tech terms such as net neutrality, abandonware, and botnet have also been included in the list of new words. The word ghost now has a new meaning - to abruptly cut off all contact with someone, such as a former romantic partner, by no longer accepting or responding to phone calls, instant messages. Supercentenarian, EpiPen and urgent care are among the words added from the field of medicines. Prosopagnosia, sometimes called ""face blindness,"" is a neurological condition that has only relatively recently been the subject of study. New words from the ever-expanding vocabulary of cooking and food include arancini, EVOO and macaron, as well as sharp tools of the kitchen santoku and chefs knife. Political terms include town hall and truther as well as SCOTUS and FLOTUS. The word snollygoster - a shrewd, unprincipled person - returned to the dictionary after being dropped in 2003 because it had fallen nearly completely from use. Familiar words combine to give us metaphors or imagery like train wreck, side-eye and weak sauce.",general,2246,60,70

Had no ego issue carrying drinks in Champions Trophy: Rahane,"It's not easy if you have been an India Test captain in March and performing the duties of a 12th man in June but Ajinkya Rahane is a team man to the core, who believes that moment one wears the India jersey, one needs to keep all his insecurities and ego issues at bay. Rahane was the captain during India's series winning Test against Australia at Dharamsala. However in Champions Trophy, he did not get to play a single match and had to perform the duties of a 12th man. But in the West Indies series that followed, he emerged as the top run-getter with Man of the Series award.""If I am the vice-captain of the Test team, it does not mean that I will not be performing my duties as a 12th man in ODIs. The moment you are representing your country, you are supposed to do whatever you are assigned. When I was carrying drinks during the Champions Trophy, I had no ego issues. That's how I am as a person,"" Rahane said.The elegant right-hander made a successful comeback into the ODI playing XI with 336 runs from five ODIs at an average of 67.20 including a hundred and three half-centuries. ""West Indies was a special series for me simply for the consistency that I was able to show. This series is an important one for my ODI career and getting runs in almost all the matches was a really satisfying feeling. I got opportunity to show a different side to my batting and express myself differently,"" said Rahane.For Rahane, more than technical, there were mental adjustments that were really very necessary. Asked to elaborate, Rahane said: ""By instinct, I am an attacking batsman but the pitches in the West Indies required a different mindset. It required patience and at times not get enticed to go for the big ones. Discretion was necessary in shot selection.""And when we talk about discretion, that's where the mind comes into play - to be able to think clearly what are the shots that I am going to play in a particular situation, on a particular kind of pitch,"" he said.For him, what made the knocks special was the pitches in the West Indies which weren't exactly batting friendly with the ones in Port of Spain and Antigua creating difficulties.""Actually the 62 that I got in the first ODI (abandoned due to rain), gave me a lot of confidence. It was my comeback match. I wanted to have a good knock under my belt. Once I got those runs, the second match was even better when I scored that century. The pitches were sluggish in nature and each pitch was so different from one another,"" he stated.The soft-spoken Rahane said that not for once did he feel insecured because he was coming in place of a rested Rohit Sharma, who is again expected to open the innings during the Sri Lanka ODIs.""This is a great phase in Indian cricket where we have so many top quality players competing for a place in the Indian team. It's always good to have competition. As far as I am concerned, I have never ever been insecure in my life.""Although he doesn't want to look too far ahead, Rahane is game about batting at any slot in the limited overs version. ""Actually my spiritual guru tells me one thing. It is very important to live in the present, irrespective of whether you are playing or not. The biggest lesson of life for me is to keep things simple.",sports,3253,60,70

Swimming microbots can remove harmful bacteria from water,"Berlin, Jun 30 (PTI) Scientists have developed magnetic microbots with silver nanoparticles that can zoom around contaminated water and clean up disease-causing bacteria. Drinking water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria can cause serious illnesses that, in areas with spotty medical services, are potentially life-threatening without proper treatment. Water can be disinfected with chlorine or other disinfectants, but there are some hardy bacteria and other microorganisms that are hard to remove. Treating water with a combination of disinfectants or increasing their concentrations can help. However, they remain in the water, and their byproducts can be harmful to human health. In recent years, researchers have been exploring the use of self-propelled micromotors to degrade and capture pollutants in water. Building on this work, researchers from Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany and Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in Spain wanted to see if they could engineer tiny robots to remove waterborne bacteria. The team designed ""two-faced"" spherical particles to perform the task. One face is made with magnesium, which reacts with water to produce hydrogen bubbles to propel the microbots. The other face is made out of alternating iron and gold layers topped by silver nanoparticles. Bacteria stick to the gold and are killed by the silver nanoparticles.",general,1403,57,70

Officials said that the camp was set up to ensure privacy to women pilgrims and ensure that no untoward incident takes place, as reported last year.?Last year, a woman pilgrim was taking a bath and a man was scanning his mobile phone in the vicinity when the woman spotted him.

'Sasikala's proximity to Jaya doesn't qualify her to be CM',"Actor Kamal Haasan has been tweeting in mysterious language as to what's unravelling in Tamil Nadu, especially the battle between VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam. In an exclusive interview to India Today, Haasan explained the mystery behind his tweets and his real message.Don't breakTN in2 a country. I promise, All India will fight 4TN in a civil war of Ahinsa.None might die but the ignorant will come aliveWe've wasted our freedom years gambling our fanchise on wrong& corrupt politicians. Let's stop blaming them Lets become incorruptable.He spoke about the anger of the people of Tamil Nadu, especially the sense of betrayal and how they must come to the streets if their politicians don't get their act together. The actor said that O Panneerselvam is competent enough to lead Tamil Nadu and Sasikala, in a sense, should back off from confrontation.In his interview, Haasan agreed that Sasikala's proximity to Jayalalithaa is no reason for her to become the chief minister and she should back off and let the people decide. ""Time of dice playing was done with in Mahabharat. We can't be playing dice and hawking our family wives and lives, in favour of some numbers [Sasikala's MLA support]. We don't trade. We are the people,"" said Haasan. On Sasikala imposing her will - ""Even I cannot impose my will. I can speak what I think, but can't impose. I may be proven wrong, but I must speak. Tamil Nadu has not had the best of service from politicians for more than 60 years. The first 10 years were glorious, but Congress..Kamraj-ji, Raja-ji.. they all became complacent. Then came Dravidian parties. Those promises were also not kept,"" said Haasan.10 statements from his interview1. ""I am being careful in what I am going to say so that it does not get embroiled with the violent forces that have now been in politics for quite some time. I am trying to be equi-poised and I am not going to show any of my anger which may lead to violence. That's why the mystery.""2. ""My anger has to come to a point of exasperation after years. I remember these broken promises for more than 40 years now. I am not blaming one party. It's high time people (of Tamil Nadu) realise their responsibilities and come forward and say - 'You told us what democracy means, but we get to call the shots. We are not getting it. We don't need leaders. We are not sheep. We don't need to be led. We want people who work for the nation just like who we are'.""3. ""I am not going to jump into the so-called bandwagon of Panneerselvam. The last conversation I had with him was during the jallikattu [row], where I told him he should go to the people. We'll have to realise how the state can be run."" 4. On his political aspirations - ""I stain my finger with a dot when I vote. That's how far am willing for the stain to spread, not anymore. I am political. I make my statement. I have political ideologies. I settle for what could be good for the people because they have the mandate to choose their leader. I am one of them. I don't want my way all the way.""5. On Sasikala being an interloper in corruption case: ""They are all there...It's a conglomeration of corruption. Let's not pinppoint a lady."" 6. ""Right now, we have a choice. A CM has been sworn in and he has not shown any signs of damage or incompetency. He has been good so far. We don't know what's coming to us. And you (political leaders) can't keep dumping us with your indecisions.This is party's indecision.""7. ""Mr Panneerselvam is not a friend or a foe. He's a tool to execute my democratic will. It doesn't matter, we'll find another tool much sharper than him, if need be. That's the direction we should take. In the name of equipoise, we can't get blunter and blunter tools so that we go back to Stone Age.""8. ""I have reservations about both of them [Panneerselvam and Sasikala]. But right now this guy has proven his mettle and is OK, and we'll throw him out of his office if we feel he is incompetent again. That's the will of people.""9.

Only five large banks can survive in long-term: Uday Kotak,"Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak feels there will be strong consolidation in the financial services sector and eventually only five players will dominate the space just like in the global space. ""Globally, in most countries, there are only three to five large banks which dominate. This is how the future will be in our country as well,"" Kotak, vice-chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank, told PTI in an interview over the weekend here. India will be no exception to this global trend of having a few dominating players, he added. When asked about the names of banks which will dominate the domestic banking space, Kotak declined to specify the names but said State Bank of India will be one among them. ""The rest who knows? Cant say anything about ourselves but each of us will have to do our bit to get ourselves onto the high table. You just cant take it for granted,"" he said. Kotak, whose bank is widely speculated to be interested in buyouts, acknowledged that consolidation is something his bank is interested in. ""We are open to change that is bold and that can be game-changing in the financial services industry,"" he said, but quickly added that there is nothing to announce now. The board of the bank last week decided to raise over Rs 5,300 crore by diluting 3.3 per cent of the promoters holding, for pursuing a host of opportunities, including consolidation. When asked if his bank which completed an integration with ING Vysya Bank, is ready for another such exercise, Kotak replied in the positive. ""Do you think we are fatigued? We are alive and kicking, and have learnt a lot from the merger. That does not mean we are rushing into a merger but we are always open and keep our eyes and ears open for consolidation,"" he said. He said the share of private sector lenders should eventually grow beyond the present 25 per cent or thereabout. ""Competition may be from government banks, new players. You have to be alert, agile and paranoid,"" he said. Kotak also made a strong pitch for having norms on ""bank mortality"", underlining that not all the players who enter due to liberal rules cant make it commercially, and should thus be given exit options. ""That is a big issue. Who is thinking about mortality in banking? We have to see in the long-term how it happens. As you make entry easier, mortality always have to be thought about,"" Kotak said. When asked about if e-wallets will succeed, Kotak said, ""to some of those models, you need to ask the question- how will you get stickiness and ultimately monetise?"" Advocating a faster push on growth, Kotak said he is getting the vibes of an uptick in growth. ""Macroeconomic stability, now combined with political stability, is a very big plus for the country to embark faster on the growth side. This is our opportunity,"" he said. When pointed to the continuing reluctance of private sector to invest since the past three years now, Kotak said, ""we need to be bold and get the animal spirits back. We will get it back, people should feel excited to invest.""",general,3022,58,70
Heavy vehicles banned on Western Express Highway of Mumbai,"In a move to ease congestion on the Western Express Highway (WEH) during evening peak hours, the traffic police have banned heavy vehicles from plying on the north-bound stretch from Bandra to Dahisar between 5pm and 9pm. While the ban is a temporary move, till the police come up with a permanent solution, it was put into effect from Monday by invoking an old government circular on restriction of heavy vehicles on highways within the city limits.The ban will be for trucks, lorries, water tankers, container carriers as well as private buses. However, ST/BEST buses, school buses and vehicles carrying essential commodities and chartered buses ? used as office drops ? will be allowed to use the highway. Massive traffic snarls on the WEH have become a common sight ever since work on the Metro-7 (Dahisar to Andheri) project began earlier this year. The situation, according to officials, has worsened after the rains arrived. While the police have enforced the north-bound traffic restrictions in the evening on a priority basis, they plan to soon bring in a similar four-hour ban on the south-bound stretch during morning peak hours. Amitesh Kumar, joint commissioner of police, traffic, told HT that the north-bound heavy vehicles will be stopped at the Kalanagar junction in Bandra (East) and diverted to the Eastern Express Highway via Sion. ?They can continue their journey using the Thane-Ghdobunder Road,? said Kumar. ?We are in the process of notifying a comprehensive strategy for the movement of heavy vehicles in the city.?Explaining the logic behind enforcing the ban first only during evening peak hours, a source said that while regular motorists travelling from the western suburbs to south Mumbai used the highway at different points of time during the morning, the situation is different during the evening. Almost 80% of these regulars are on the highway between 5pm and 6pm and that creates unprecedented rush. Meanwhile, Kumar said discussions are on with the Thane police to enforce a similar four-hour ban on the entry of heavy vehicles into the city in the morning. ?As per our plans, heavy vehicles will not be allowed from the Dahisar toll plaza during 7am and 11am,? said Kumar, adding that a decision is likely to taken within a week?s time. ?That will ease the flow of south-bound traffic in the morning.?However, since thousands of heavy vehicles from nearby states enter the city through the Dahisar check naka on a daily basis, blocking them for four hours in the morning could create jams on the highway beyond Dahisar. ?We are aware of the problem. Arrangements will be made to either divert them to Thane, so that they can enter the city through Mulund by using the Eastern Express Highway, or some alternative parking arrangements would be made at Mira-Bhayandar,? Kumar said.Read more:Heavy rain leaves Mumbai officegoers stuck in traffic for hours",general,2891,58,70
Khalistan Commando Force member wanted in 75 cases arrested,"A 51-year-old alleged member of the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) was arrested on Monday from south Delhi?s Mahipalpur. A country-made pistol and four cartridges were allegedly found on him.Police said the arrested man, Gursewak Singh aka Babla, was reportedly in the process of establishing KCF?s base in Delhi with the help of some gangs of autolifters and robbers. By committing bank and ATM robberies in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana with the Delhi?s criminals, Babla was reportedly planning to raise funds to carry out terror activities in Delhi and Punjab, police said.?Babla was under pressure from his handler, KCF chief Paramjeet Singh Panjwar, to strike against India and revive their outfit?s presence in Delhi and Punjab. Panjwar is presently based in Pakistan and running anti-India activities allegedly with Pakistan?s intelligence agency ISI?s help,? said a crime branch officer. Praveer Ranjan, joint commissioner of police (crime branch), said Babla was a close aide of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was killed 1984 by the Army in Operation Blue Star. Babla has spent more than 26 years, half of his life, in various jails in different cases, said the joint CP.Police claimed he was previously involved in over 50 cases of terrorist activities, murder of police officials and police informers, and dacoities and robberies in police stations, banks, shops in Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh during the Punjab insurgency in the 1980s. Ranjan said that Babla was wanted by the special cell, Delhi Police?s anti-terror squad, in a case when he had escaped from the custody of the Punjab police while being produced at the Tis Hazari Court in Delhi in 2004. ?A case was registered at the Subzi Mandi police station and the probe was handed over to the special cell. Babla was wanted by us (Delhi Police) in that case and the court had declared him a proclaimed offender,? said Ranjan, adding he had escaped again from Punjab police custody at Bhilwara railway station in Rajasthan in 1986.According to the joint CP, Babla?s arrest came following information that he would come to Mahipalpur area to meet some criminals with whom he was planning to commit bank and ATM robberies in the city. ?Our team laid a trap and caught Babla from near Shiv Murti on NH-8 with a pistol and four rounds,? Ranjan said adding Babla was also in touch with Jagtar Singh Hawara and other top leaders of Sikh militant groups who are lodged in different jails.A native of Ludhiana in Punjab, DCP Bhisham Singh said, Babla joined Bhindranwale-led militant group in 1982, almost two years after his elder brother Swaran Singh became a militant.",general,2657,59,70

Two years is a long time in politics,? he added, referring to the 2019 parliamentary polls.He said the decline of the Congress was also ?worrying?, because a single party system was not ?good? for democracy.?Single party governance made even the great democrat Jawahar Lal Nehru arrogant; it made the instinctively authoritarian Indira Gandhi even more authoritarian. So what will this do to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah is something that I have started thinking about,? the author -- known for critiquing both the Left and the Right -- said.India had failed to emulate the stable two-party model of western democracies, Guha said, adding that the importance of two-party rivalry in states should not be undermined.?Like Modi, he has no family burden, but, unlike Modi, he is not a megalomaniac. He is not sectarian and focuses on gender, which is rare among Indian politicians. So there are things about Nitish that were appealing, and are appealing??The three states in India which have performed well over the past 70 years, according to economic and social indicators, are Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh.

Class 6 student commits suicide in his Hyderabad hostel room,"A 12-year old boy allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself at his hostel room at Jeedimetla on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Wednesday. According to Jeedimetla police, the body of Fareeduddin, a Class 6 student of Telangana Minority Welfare Residential School, was found hanging from the ceiling of his hostel room on the first floor of the school building. He reportedly cut his bedsheet vertically, made it into a rope, tied it to the ceiling fan and hanged himself. School principal Syed Aslam Nazir told the media that Fareeduddin was sharing the hostel room with four other boys, who were fast asleep when he took the extreme step.

"Remove Emergency, scam references from Maha textbooks: Opp'n","The Opposition slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Maharashtra government for mentioning the names of former Congress Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi in state board history textbooks in reference to the Emergency and Bofors scam, respectively. Legislators raised uproar in the state legislative council demanding the government delete these references and alleged the state government is trying to drive its political agenda by influencing educational material. Legislative Council chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar had to adjourn the house for 10 minutes for the chaos to die down. Congress? Sanjay Dutt who raised the issue in the upper house said, ?The defamatory reference to former PM Indira Gandhi while mentioning the Emergency and Rajiv Gandhi about Bofors in the state school board?s history and political science textbook for Class 9 should be removed.

Consequently, the notice is stayed till further order of this court,? the High Curt said. The commission had directed the secretary of the club to appear in person before it on July 14. Challenging the commission?s order, the club said that the commission in Meghalaya did not have jurisdiction to issue such direction on an incident, which had happened outside that state. The commission acted upon a complaint made by Tailin Lyngdoh, a governess, who accused the club and its members of allowing racial profiling of people, which was tantamount to racial discrimination of tribal people, which is a punishable offence. On June 25, staffers of the Delhi Golf Club had asked Lyngdoh, an invited guest, to leave the dining room because her traditional Khasi attire ?jainsem? looked like a ?maid?s uniform?.

"Five-year-old girl fined ?12,500 for running lemonade stall","A five-year-old girl was left in tears after being fined £150 for running a stall selling cups of homemade lemonade to passersby.The schoolgirl was accused of trading without a licence by a council enforcement officer last Saturday, her father, Andre Spicer, said. The officer issued a fixed penalty notice demanding the sum ? or £90 if the family agreed to pay promptly.?She was very upset and had to watch Brave a few times to calm down,? he said.Spicer, a professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City University London, said his daughter decided she wanted to set up the stall in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets after attending her school fete.?She wanted to sell toys or food or clothes but she eventually decided on lemonade. It was a way to entertain her on a summer?s day. We set up the stand and people started buying the lemonade. They were on the way to a concert and she brought a smile to their faces,? he said.But he said that, after about half an hour, an enforcement official approached them and ?immediately launched into a legalistic script?. They were handed the fine and told to pay within 14 days if they wanted to avoid the higher penalty.Spicer said he was shocked, adding that the difference between his daughter?s lemonade stand and an unlicensed street trader should have been common sense.He directed a tweet at Tower Hamlets council and, on deeper reflection, ?realised there were broader issues at stake, including how society treats children?.The fine was dropped and an apology issued after Spicer was moved to write an article for the Telegraph. But the academic, who has also written for the Guardian, said it was one thing for someone in such a privileged position as his to be able to fight back ? and quite another for someone without such a platform.?If there are other people who have been fined in a similar way, then this is kind of worrying. We are shooting down opportunities for kids to learn,? he said.A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: ?We are very sorry that this has happened. We expect our enforcement officers to show common sense, and to use their powers sensibly. This clearly did not happen.?The fine will be cancelled immediately and we have contacted Prof Spicer and his daughter to apologise.?",general,2294,59,70

The two actors were on the sets of their upcoming film Raabta when Cupid struck. Sushant parted ways with his longtime girlfriend Ankita Lokhande right before diving into the relationship with Kriti Sanon.

Sets of film 'Padmavati' set on fire in Maharashtra,"There seems to be no respite for filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali. His upcoming film Padmavati has been under the scanner ever since the director announced the ambitious project. And after the Jaipur attack, Bhansali shifted base to Kolhapur in Maharashtra to resume the shooting of the film. But if reports are to be believed, the sets were once again attacked on Tuesday night, this time in Kolhapur. According to reports, 40-50 unidentified men tried to vandalise the sets and set it on fire. The men, armed with lathis and stones, stormed into the sets and started destroying the property. Reportedly, a few cars parked outside the sets were also damaged. ""Police is probing this matter and further investigation is on. We have asked the production house to lodge formal complaint in this issue. Some one intentionally did this, that is for sure,"" said Deepak Kesarkar, Minister of State for Home. It's been more than 13 hours since the incident took place but police has not got any concrete leads on this. Police is yet to identify the miscreants.""It's failure on the part of government. They should take responsibility of this. Bhansali shifted venue for security reasons, but it's sad to see that the set was attacked here too. We condemn this act and demand government to nab the culprits,"" said, Jitendra Awhad, NCP MLA. It was only a few weeks ago that Bhansali decided to shift base to the Masai plateau, some 20km away from Kolhapur. Interestingly, the filmmaker beefed up the security after the Jaipur incident where he was manhandled by members of the Karni Sena and accused of distortion of history in Padmavati. The reason for the attack was that Bhansali was allegedly showing a romantic sequence between 14th century emperor Alauddin Khilji (played by Ranveer Singh) and Rani Padmini (played by Deepika Padukone), an incident which the Karni Sena claims had never happened in history and thus, filming the same would be an insult to the Rajputana pride.Interestingly, the filmmakers had never planned to have such a scene in the first place. Moreover, Rani Padmini is a character that was first written of in an epic poem named Padmavat by 16th century Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Padmini's existence is a matter of debate among historians. Meanwhile, it is reported Bhansali is safe, but the shooting of the film has been stalled till further notice.

Millions of cases are pending in India's courts, draining litigants of resources and pointing towards an urgent need for more judges and judicial reforms.

Anchal Agarwal, co-founder of research and analytics firm Tofler said while the absolute amount of losses have indeed widened, the loss margin has ""reduced considerably"". ""They spent almost Rs 8.5 for every rupee earned in 2014 -15. That number is down to almost Rs 4 for every rupee earned for 2015-16. With the pull-back in incentives etc in recent months, its possible this has now dropped to levels at par with e-commerce companies that spend roughly Rs 2-3 for every rupee earned,"" she added. The consolidated numbers include financials of ANI Technologies, Ola Fleet Technologies (leasing business), Serendipity Infolabs (Taxi For Sure) and Zipcash Card Service (46 per cent ownership). In August 2016, Ola shut down the TaxiForSure (TFS) business, about 18 months after acquiring the rival for USD 200 million. As per the filing, Olas losses were widened on account of employee related expenses rising over five-fold to Rs 461.60 crore in the said fiscal from Rs 85.16 crore in 2014- 15. Similarly, Ola expanded its advertising and promotional expenditure to over Rs 437.89 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 99.84 crore in the previous year. Both Ola and Uber have loosened their purse strings to bring more riders and driver partners on board, offering them discounted rides and incentives, in a bid to wrest control of the lucrative Indian market. Over the last few years, the explosion of smartphones in India ? the world?s second largest telecom market in terms of subscriber base ? has made it more convenient for consumers to book a cab on the go through apps and secure payment options. Companies like Ola and Uber have made booking a taxi ride as easy as a couple of quick taps on the phone screen. Since ANI Technologies is not a publicly-traded company, it is not obligated to disclose quarterly performance. It has raised investments of over USD 1.5 billion from investors, including SoftBank Group, Tiger Global, Matrix Partners, Steadview Capital, Sequoia India, Accel Partners US and Falcon Edge.",general,2744,49,70

After months and months of delay, the film is finally ready to hit the screens on July 14. But a few days before its release, the makers were in for a shock when the Central Board of Film Certification decided to give it a U/A certificate.

But according to a report in DNA, CBFC did find something objectionable and has asked parents to accompany their kids during the film. This decision has made the makers quite unhappy. A source close to director Anurag Basu was quoted as telling the daily, ""We wonder what the censor board saw in Jagga Jasoos that made it suitable for children only accompanied by an adult.""The film revolves around the story of a boy in search of his father.

'Tardigrades' can survive until the end of Earth: Study,"Whether it is a supernova or an asteroid impact, should a cosmic calamity strike, it seems there will be at least one form of life left: a tubby, microscopic animal with the appearance of a crumpled hoover bag.The creatures, known as tardigrades, are staggeringly hardy animals, a millimetre or less in size, with species living in wet conditions that range from mountain tops to chilly ocean waters to moss and lichen on land.?They can survive incredible conditions ? we are talking close to absolute zero, the vacuum of space, exposure to radiation that would kill us, and these things just walk away from it like nothing happened,? said David Sloan, an astrophysicist from the University of Oxford.Now new research by Sloan and colleagues has shown that the creatures would survive any cosmic disaster that might conceivably be thrown at Earth ? a discovery that could have implications elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond. ?There are quite a lot of stars like our sun out there, and about 20% of these stars have an Earth-like planet around them,? said Sloan. ?What you then want to ask is if life started on one of these planets, what are the odds that it is still around??Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe how they probed the conundrum by exploring the likelihood of a variety of catastrophes serious enough to wipe out tardigrades on an Earth-like planet, including a nearby supernova, a burst of gamma-rays, and an impact by a large asteroid powerful enough to cause the oceans to boil away. But the team found that the chances of such events were so remote as to be extremely unlikely ? there was little chance of a supernova occurring close enough to an Earth-like planet to kill off the creatures, and it would take an impact from an asteroid or dwarf planet near the mass of Vesta for the oceans to boil. ?There are about 17 [asteroids] this big in our solar system, but they are all on sufficient orbits that they will never intersect with us,? said Sloan. The upshot, he said, was that it was very unlikely any cosmic event would be so catastrophic as to sterilise an Earth-like planet where life, of the sort we know, had got going. ?Because [tardigrades] are so hardy it means that events that we are worried about as human beings, and rightly so, certainly wouldn?t concern you if you just considered all life,? said Sloan. Matthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved in the study said the findings were reassuring for the future of life on Earth.?It suggests that the complete eradication of life on Earth is extremely unlikely until we get to the point that the sun enlarges and all the oceans boil away,? he said. ?Many organisms, in particular animals and bacteria, live in the deep ocean, which the authors show would be unaffected by any conceivable cosmic cataclysm.?Mark Blaxter, professor of evolutionary genomics at the University of Edinburgh, agreed, adding that there are other organisms have a similar survival strategy to tardigrades. What?s more, he said, there are also organisms that live very deep underground in hot water within continental and under-sea-floor rocks. ?Sterilising the planet would have to deal with these too,? he noted. He also stressed that even tardigrades are not invincible. ?[Land-based] tardigrades stay alive in extreme conditions by drying out completely. So if there was no water left ? there would be no ?live? tardigrades, just dried up ones,? said Blaxter. ?And if there was some water left so that the tardigrades could re-animate, if there was no food left they eat algae and fungi - they too would be dead in a couple of weeks.?Cobb, too, noted that even if the tardigrades were the only survivors, they would face a struggle. ?For the tardigrades to inherit the Earth, whatever catastrophe swept over the planet would have to return to normal-ish conditions within a matter of decades at most, or it really could be curtains,? he said.",science,3991,55,70

Russian helicopters' 'Make in India' cost 250% of original,"The price of Kamov light-utility choppers to be built in India is coming out to be almost 2.5 times the cost of the 60 such helicopters that would be built in Russia and supplied to the Indian Army and Air Force, for operations in high altitude areas such as Siachen and Ladakh.The issue over price and transfer of technology are slowing the deal which the armed forces require urgently to be completed to replace their vintage fleet of Cheetah and Chetak choppers for critical operations.Under a Indo-Russian governmental agreement, India is buying 200 Kamov 226 T helicopters of which 60 would be built in Russia and supplied directly to the forces while the remaining 140 would be manufactured in a joint venture between Kamov and HAL along with a private sector partner.""During negotiations with the Russian side, it has come out that the cost of the 140 choppers to be built in India would be around 2.5 times the cost of the first 60 helicopters. There are certain issues over this in the acquisition wing,"" Defence sources told MAIL TODAY.The progress of the deal may come up for discussion during the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow planned early next month.However, senior ministry officials said Make in India comes at a heavy cost as investments have to be made to create a new facility and manpower has to be trained along with acquisition of land for the new set up.The government had selected HAL as a partner but later on it also thought of including a private sector partner for the joint venture company to promote private participation in defence but this is going to add further cost to the programme, the sources said.H.A.L YET TO TAKE FINAL CALLThe decision on selecting the private sector partner has to be taken by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the company is yet to take a final call on the issue.The deal is also getting affected by the issue over the weight of the choppers, as it is believed that the ones built in Russia weigh more than what was specified in the tender requirements by the force.""The issue has been raised with the Russians and it is expected that some solutions would be found for reducing the weight soon,"" a source said.Sources said there seemed to be a minor issue over the interpretation of the clauses on the transfer of technology for the Kamov choppers as during one of the meetings, the Russians proposed to supply the 140 choppers to built in India as complete knocked-down and semi-knocked down kits -which would mean that the choppers would only be assembled and not built in India.TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY""We are very clear that we want transfer of technology for these choppers so that they can be built in future by our firms on their own in the future,"" a defence official said.Price has been a critical issue in defence deals involving Russia as several deals such as the under-development Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and Multirole Transport Aircraft projects have been stuck because of the sudden and exorbitant cost hikes by Moscow.The biggest example of India suffering due to price hike was the INS Vikramaditya aircraft carrier project, which was to cost $900 million (over Rs 5,000 crore)at the time of signing in 2004, but was delivered in 2014 after an additional cost of $1.2 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) in 2014.ALSO READ | Indian Army may acquire 39 American Apache choppers to enhance fire power at Pakistan, China borders",general,3487,58,70

"Kohli will catch up with Dhoni as captain, says Ravi Shastri","Virat Kohli?s ascendancy since becoming the India Test captain in 2014 has been startling. His aggressive attitude coupled with brilliance in batting meant that the national team found a perfect successor to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose achievement as skipper is unmatched in Indian cricket.While still it is early days, but Kohli can match Dhoni?s achievements as skipper, believes India?s new head coach Ravi Shastri.(Read | Virat Kohli ?spoilt for choices? ahead of second India vs Sri Lanka Test match) The claim may be tall since Dhoni remains the only cricket captain in the world to win all ICC trophies ? the World Cup, the World T20 and the Champions Trophy. His time at the helm of India also saw them claiming the No. 1 position in Tests.But then Kohli has also got a great start to his career as captain. Among all the captains who have led India for more than 20 Test matches, Kohli has the highest win percentage. In 27 Tests, he has 17 wins with 62.96 win percentage. Dhoni won 27 out of 60 Tests as captain, with the win percentage being 45.

Beside that, he has also finished runner-up in another World T20. He played in the semi-finals of two other World T20 and World Cups. People often talk about his limited-over record, but compare Dhoni?s Test with any captain and it will show who is the greatest ever ,? Shari said.?Virat is progressing in the same direction as well.?When Shastri was the team director of India from 2014 to 2016, he saw both Dhoni and Kohli as captains from close quarters. In fact, it was during Shastri?s time at the helm that Dhoni quit as Test captain to make way for Kohli in 2014.Shastri added that Kohli has potential to be the greatest captain of the current generation but may face stiff competition from an Australian.?Steve Smith. As a captain his batting record is exceptional,? Shastri said.As a captain, Smith?s batting average is 73.27, second only to Don Bradman?s 101.51.

There is a void after Kumble's exit: India batting coach,"Batting coach Sanjay Bangar says Anil Kumble's departure as head coach has definitely left a void in the Indian cricket team set-up even though the players are ""coping up"" well.Kumble, a spinner par excellence and a former India captain, tendered his resignation as chief coach after the ICC Champions Trophy due to ""untenable"" differences with skipper Virat Kohli.On the eve of the second ODI against the West Indies here, questions related to the Kumble episode were directed at Bangar.""We are professionals and such things are part and parcel of any organisation where changes happen. The support staff and the players have shown a lot of professionalism in compartmentalising the issues and so far we have coped up really well,"" said Bangar.The 44-year-old former all-rounder said the team was focussed on the job at hand.""Everyone's contributed towards it and as I said earlier, when you part ways it's never easy. You need to accept that at times such things are going to happen, have happened in the past. But what is of paramount importance is that Indian cricket should keep moving forward and the performances of the team shouldn't really be affected in any manner.""Without a head coach, who also used to double up as the team's bowling coach, Bangar has his work cut out.""Yes, Anil was doubling up. There were a lot of positive results under him. We all know that the team enjoyed a lot of success. The void, there is definitely a bit of lacuna but the experience that this team possesses - when you have a Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a Yuvraj Singh and Virat Kohli, who've played close to 700 international games, they're doing a lot of work behind the scenes, they are guiding the players.""Further speaking about the role of the senior players, he said, ""It's not only the coaching staff, the mentoring that they do and the exchange of ideas among them, there is a wealth of knowledge which the players benefit from.""Asked what defines the captain-coach relationship, Bangar stressed on trust.""It's not only the coach and the captain, it's also the relationship and trust between the coach and all the players.Basically, it's a work in progress that requires a lot of time to earn the trust of the players.""Once you do that, the job and the responsibilities of the coach become that much more easy.

Delhi Metro may become largest metro system outside China,"The Delhi Metro, which has issued tenders for the topographical survey of its six lines under Phase 4 approved by Delhi government, plans to start construction by August. The lines under Phase 4, in addition to the 140 kilometres added in Phase 3, are expected to free up traffic bottlenecks in congested central and southern parts of the city, and help passengers from outer Delhi.Phase 3 of Metro?s expansion is likely to be completed by mid-2017. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has been seeking approval to start Phase 4?s construction for over a year. The new phase will particularly benefit south Delhi as residents will have the option of taking the Metro to go to the airport.After the completion of Phase 4, the Delhi Metro will become the largest Metro system outside China to carry about seven million passengers every day. Right now, it is the 11th largest Metro system. After Phase 3?s completion, we should be fourth or fifth.The DMRC has proposed to build a 20-km corridor between the existing Aerocity and Tughlakabad Metro stations. The line will go through densely populated areas of Sangam Vihar, Saket, Mehrauli, Vasant Kunj and Mahipalpur of south Delhi. The Delhi government rejected a proposal to extend it to the Terminal 1 station.

Once this line, which is part of Phase 4 of DMRC, is completed, passengers will have different options of going to the airport. From Aerocity, they can take the Airport Line to go to Terminal 3,? said a senior DMRC official.Phase 4 will add to the ridership of the Airport Line.

Show price changes after GST via stickers till Sep 30: Govt,"New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Clearing the air on unsold stocks of goods post GST implementation, the government today allowed use of stickers with revised rates, alongside the printed MRP for pre-packaged items, for three months to reflect changes in selling price. The clarification from the government came as several businesses were left with huge unsold inventories before the GST kicked in from July 1. The unsold items had an MRP which included all taxes of pre-GST era but with the implementation of new regime, some of the final retail prices have undergone changes because of increase or decrease in tax incidences. The old maximum retail price (MRP) will have to be necessarily displayed on the unsold inventories and the new rates can be reflected by way of pastable stickers alongside, Consumer Affairs Secretary Avinash Srivastava told reporters here. On items where the price has to be increased for unsold stocks, the manufacturer or packer or importer will have to give at least two advertisements in two or more newspapers informing people about the change. However, after September 30, the printed MRP on pre- packaged commodity will have to necessary include the GST rate and no add-on stickers would be allowed. ""The central government hereby, permits the manufacturer or packer or importer of pre-packaged commodities to declare the changed retail sale price (MRP) for three months from July 1-September 30. Declaration of the changed MRP shall be made by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing,"" a government notification said.

Ramdev chants 'Om' instead of saying 'Hello' over the phone,"New Delhi, Apr 30 (PTI) A young Ramdev was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school as the curriculum was a leftover of the colonial education policy, fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul. Saraswatis book ""Satyarth Prakash"" had a deep impact on Ramdev. While greeting someone over phone, Ramdev never says hello. Instead he chants Om. The first chapter of ""Satyarth Prakash"" explains the etymology and significance of Om. After reading the book, Ramdev wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages. As the path of ancient sages also meant practice of celibacy, so he took a vow - to never marry. A new book ""The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market"" by Kaushik Deka has these nuggets of information. ""Satyarth Prakash"" was written in Hindi in 1875 by the renowned religious and social reformer and the founder of Arya Samaj. The book formed the intellectual core and social, political and economic philosophy of the yoga guru. It was a book primarily explaining the true tenets of Hinduism, making an appeal for one uniform religion based on the principles of the Vedas. ""This book was a revelation to me. It awakened my inner- self, gave me a sense of purpose in life. It introduced me to the wisdom of our ancestors. I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages,"" Ramdev is quoted as saying. ""Satyarth Prakash"" not only changed Ramdevs life but also gave it a direction and purpose. ""He was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school where the curriculum was a leftover of the education policy introduced by British politician Babington Macaulay (1800?59), who was instrumental in the introduction of English as the medium of instruction for higher education in India. ""He knew his parents would never agree to his decision of quitting regular school, where he was doing exceptionally well. So one fine day he fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul, a traditional educational institute based on Vedic principles, at Khanpur in Haryana,"" Deka writes. Ramdev was the brightest student in the government primary school, located in the village, where he studied till the class V. For higher classes he moved to the Shahbajpur High School, a few kilometres away. ""I used to buy second-hand books, yet I always topped my class,"" claims Ramdev. ""Dayanandji made me realise the value of the treasure trove hidden in Vedic education. Its a progressive approach based on tark (logic), tathya (facts), yukti (argument) and praman (evidence). The goal of British education system was to enslave our mind and curb free and logical thinking,"" he says. ""The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market"", published by Rupa, offers a detailed account of Ramdevs journey from attaining moksha in the Himalayas to ruling the market, especially the FMCG sector, with his Patanjali products. It captures the rise and rise of Patanjali and the various factors that worked for it, most importantly, the vision of Ramdev and the assistance of his associate Acharya Balkrishna.",general,3086,59,70
India's first underwater metro to come up in Kolkata,"Kolkata will soon have an underwater Metro which will pass through tunnels several feet under the Hooghly. The first underwater transportation tunnel of India is ready with the second one nearing completion. The Kolkata Metro transportation tunnel is unique to India because never before in the history of the country has a tunnel been made under a flowing river.The tunnel has been constructed 30 metres below riverbed, just a few metres away from the famous Howrah Bridge, built in the last century to connect Howrah and Kolkata. There aren't even roads that are under a river in India making the Kolkata Metro tunnel a complete technology marvel which will see trains will chugging through it every two and a half minutes.""It will be connecting two main terminals: Howrah and Sealdah - each of which has a footfall of about 10-12 lakh passengers per day. These type of tunnel-boring machines, which we call 'earth pressure balancing tunnel boring machines', have been used for the first time in Eastern India,"" said Satish Kumar, Managing Director of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.Another interesting point is that more than 10 lakh tonne of mud has been dug out for the construction of this tunnel. The tunnel-boring machines were used for the first time in eastern India.The entire 16.6-kilometre stretch of the first tunnel is ready. The second tunnel is yet to be completed. Of the entire length, 10.8 kms is underground and around one kilometre is underwater..""For tunnelling below the river, the water tightness, waterproofing, and the design of gaskets were the major challenges, because the tunnel is being constructed for a service of 120 years, so we cannot afford any water leakage during service,"" said Kumar.Tunnelling cannot be done for long hence the homework was done for almost an year and then the machines and equipment shifted to the location for final implementation and execution of the plan. The material used gives it immunity to survive quakes in seismic zone 3, in which Kolkata falls.The use of the standard gauge makes it a unique one. It is the latest technology that has been utilised to ensure that the tracks have sharp curves, keeping in mind that this tunnel passes under a lot of heritage buildings.The heritage buildings had to be protected, and the work was not supposed to stop even for a day in these buildings.",general,2359,52,70

Iran nuclear chief warns US over support to Saudi Arabia,"The head of Iran?s atomic energy organisation, one of the architects of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, has warned the US to stop upsetting the regional balance of power by siding with Saudi Arabia.Writing in the Guardian, Ali Akbar Salehi said ?lavish arms purchases? by regional actors ? a reference to the Saudi purchase of $100bn of US arms during Donald Trump?s recent visit to Riyadh ? would be seen as provocative in Tehran and that it would be unrealistic to expect Iran to remain ?indifferent?. Salehi, an MIT graduate scientist who has also served as foreign minister, was the second most senior Iranian negotiator, dealing with technical aspects, during nearly two years of talks between Tehran and six of the world?s major powers that led to the final nuclear accord in Vienna in July 2015.Although Trump has promised to ?dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran?, he has not so far taken any concrete steps to scrap it. Last month, two days before Iran?s presidential election, his administration announced that it was continuing to waive nuclear-related sanctions under the agreement despite Washington toughening up its overall Iran policy. Salehi said it was possible to rescue the deal?s engagement if it was met with reciprocal gestures. ?Often following hard-won engagement, some western nations, whether distracted by short-sighted political motivations or the lucrative inducements of regional actors, walk away and allow the whole situation to return to the status quo ante,? wrote Salehi, who is also a vice-president of Iran.Salehi warned of ?chaotic behaviour? and ?further tension and conflict? if the other side disregarded Iran?s security concerns, failed to adhere to its commitments and insisted on what he called alternative facts including ideas such as the ?clash of civilisations?, ?Sunni-Shia conflict?, ?Persian-Arab enmity? and the ?Arab-Israeli axis against Iran?. His article comes at a time of simmering tensions in the Middle East, where relations between Tehran and Riyadh, which are on opposite sides of many regional conflicts such as the wars in Syria and Yemen, have deteriorated. Trump?s first post-election foreign trip to Riyadh tilted the regional balance, and contributed in part to the diplomatic isolation of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies, who have accused the tiny emirate of funding terrorists and appeasing Iran. Meanwhile, in Syria, Iran-backed militias and a coalition of forces led by Washington have collided a number of times in recent weeks while fighting Islamic State. ?Stoking Iranophobia? or failure to deliver on promises under the deal would jeopardise engagement, Salehi wrote. ?We would all end up back at square one,? he cautioned. ?Unfortunately, as things stand at the moment in the region, reaching a new state of equilibrium might simply be beyond reach for the foreseeable future.?Salehi urged the outside world to take heed of the results of last month?s Iranian presidential election and the message Iranians sent, but he said ?engagement is simply not a one-way street and we cannot go it alone?.",world,3082,56,70

Officials said the team will visit areas with highest dengue cases across 24 wards and will study data compiled in the past three years to contain dengue menace in the city.

Australian fans dislike Kohli as much as Jardine: Dean Jones,"Virat Kohli is the ""head of the snake"". This is how Australia spinner Nathan Lyon described the India captain in the second Test in Bengaluru. Kohli's aggressive nature on the field has earned him admiration in the cricketing world but Australians also hate him.Former Australia batsman Dean Jones in his column for The Sydney Morning Herald explained how ""Kohli is almost as disliked as English captain Douglas Jardine"".The second Test of the series became a hot topic when the captains of both teams Virat Kohli and Steve Smith traded blows at each other. Kohli almost called Australians ""cheats"" when Smith, to everyone's surprise, tried to take help with DRS from his team's dressing room after he was trapped leg before by Umesh Yadav. Kohli warned the Aussies for ""crossing the line"" then two boards jumped in and backed their captains before International Cricket Council put an end to the controversy by not pressing charges against either of the players.""Kohli is now Australia's No. 1 enemy or the ""head of the snake"", as Nathan Lyon has put it. The Australian boys are quite prepared to take it up to him and this series has been compulsive viewing. This is what Test match cricket is about. It's the same when we play England for the Ashes or when India meet Pakistan,"" Jones wrote in his column. (Ranchi Test: Kohli bats at usual No.4 but falls cheaply again)""Test cricket is at its best when there is an edge to it. With the extra interest from fans and the media in a big series such as this, the contest seems to have become personal, very personal,"" he added.Jones further praised Kohli for his work ethics but said the Indian cricket's poster boy ""loves getting into hot spots on the field"".""I am an unabashed Kohli fan. I commentate all around the world and I love watching this kid bat and lead his team. He is such an interesting character. Away from the cricket, he is quite a humble kid. Always polite, and always asking questions on how he is batting and what I am up to. He just loves the game and the challenges that go with it."" (Maxwell mocks Kohli's injury)'VILLAINOUS AS JARDINE'""Kohli believes in hard work and that he can do anything on a cricket field. He loves getting into hot spots on the field to make sure he is in his opponents' face. Kohli is the only captain I know who pumps up the crowd, asking them for their support. He knows the importance of the Indian fans' input and how it can help his team's performance. He doesn't just want 11 Indian players in the Australian faces, he demands the same from the 30,000-strong Indian crowds. Make this ground the most hostile environment the Australians will experience. It's no different to what the MCG crowds have given to opposition teams.""""So why don't Australian fans like him? I feel he is almost as disliked as villainous English captain Douglas Jardine, who started the Bodyline series in 1932-33. Is this what needs to happen for Australia and India to build up their rivalry? If so, I have no problem with it. I love the aggression that's being produced in the media and from the fans.

SBI declines to share amount of money in suspended accounts,"By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, May 4 (PTI) The SBI has declined to share the quantum of money lying in suspended bank accounts in which the interest amount of customers, who do not claim it due to religious reasons, is kept. Replying to an RTI query, the State Bank of India (SBI) said it does not maintain such information in its database ""in normal course of business and extraction of the same will be voluminous and time taking activity"". ""We, therefore, decline your application under Section 7 (9) of RTI Act as the information sought by you is likely to divert disproportionately the resources of the bank,"" it said in reply to the application filed by PTI. The section bars disclosure of information which would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority or would be detrimental to the safety or preservation of the record in question. The bank was asked to provide details of suspended accounts including their total number and amount lying in them. It was also asked to share details of guidelines to deal with such amount of interest. The interest money which is not claimed by people due to religious obligations is kept in suspended bank accounts. According to an article published in Reserve Bank of Indias journal in 2005, it was reported that in India thousands of crores earned in interest is kept in suspended accounts. ""Research reveals that a handsome bulk of money in India owned by believers is lying idle, which if invested in profit sharing basis and utilised properly, can have a major impact on the Indian economy,"" reads the article.

15 arrested for sedition after cheering for Pakistan in MP,"Police in Madhya Pradesh have arrested 15 youngsters and have charged them with sedition allegedly because they cheered and seemingly supported the Pakistani cricket team over the Indians during Sunday's Champions Trophy finals. The 15 youngsters, who are from the same community, were arrested from Madhya Pradesh's Burhanpur district and are set to be produced in front of a court today. Additional Director General (ADG) Indore Ajay Sharma told India Today that a resident of village Mohad in Burhanpur district filed a complaint with the Shahpur police station that some youngsters were celebrating the victory of Pakistan and were also raising pro-Pakistan slogans. The complainant said that crackers were being burst close to homes of people belonging to the majority community. Acting on the complaint, police detained and booked the youngsters under section 124A (sedition) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.The police said that they were apprehensive that a communal situation could erupt in the area after the match owing to youngsters' alleged cheering for the Pakistani. Police believed that the tempers were particularly running high as the outcome of the match was unfavourable for the Indian cricket team. The police said that the similar complaints had been received from the village, which is located close to the Maharashtra border, in the past during India-Pakistan cricket encounters. A top police official claimed that the charges were invoked not for supporting a particular side during the cricket game but because pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans were raised.Also read:Many Indians thank team India for losing Champions Trophy to Pakistan",general,1688,58,70
Bombay HC criticises state for condition of tribal schools,"The Bombay high court on Friday criticised the Maharashtra government for its apathy towards students in its ashram (residential) schools in tribal areas. Terming the condition of such schools ?pitiable? and ?ridiculous?, a bench of justices RM Savant and Sadhana Jadhav said that the state had wasted time by constituting one committee after another but and had taken no steps to improve the infrastructure and facilities of these schools.The bench directed the secretary of the state tribal welfare department to file within three weeks a compliance report, including remedial measures, to improve the conditions of ashram schools in Maharashtra. It directed the state to provide basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, toilets etc.These schools, meant primarily for children from tribal areas in the state, battle neglect and government apathy. The direction came while the bench was hearing a public interest litigation claiming that 793 children had died over the past 10 years in various ashram schools. The reasons for these deaths ranged from snake bites to fevers to other illnesses. ?This is really ridiculous. The state government is obligated to provide basic facilities. It is the government?s duty and responsibility. Except passing hollow resolutions, the government has done little to improve the condition,? the bench said. ?Immediate action must be taken to provide basic facilities such as clean and adequate number of toilets, drinking water facility, medical treatment, beddings and mattresses in hostels etc. The government must also appoint a female warden in each school that has girl students,? the bench said.

Porn clip plays on a screen at Delhi's Rajiv Chowk station,"Commuters at the busy Rajiv Chowk Metro station in central Delhi?s Connaught Place were left shocked when a pornographic clip played on an LED screen for around 10 minutes.The screen, that was installed on April 9 and is meant to display advertisements, started playing a porn video all of a sudden, eyewitnesses said. The video continued for several minutes and was stopped only after some commuters brought it to the attention of DMRC officials at the station.The incident was recorded by several commuters on their mobile phones and has been shared multiple times on various social media platforms, forcing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to initiate an inquiry.

CCTV footage is under examination to identify the culprits,? said Dayal.?This sort of interference with the system will not be possible in the future once the software is programmed and centrally controlled. In the interim, during the commissioning process, the contractor will be advised to ensure password protection,?

Though Ramya Krishnan's performance deserves a special mention, the character Sivagami will be more remembered for the controversy associated with Sridevi and filmmaker SS Rajamouli. It's a well-known fact that Sridevi was initially approached for playing Sivagami's role. However, when the Himmatwala actor turned down the offer, reports were doing the rounds that the actor demanded a higher remuneration for the film and hence, the makers offered the role to Ramya.

Now, Rajamouli has responded to Sridevi's statements and has said that he made a mistake.According to a report in DNA, Rajamouli was quoted as saying, ""As for whose version to believe, I guess it is for people to decide.

Cows sold online after ban on sale of cattle for slaughter,"Hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital India. So, a swift search on online marketplaces such as OLX shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline Hindu supporters of the Narendra Modi government. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.Ravi Sharma from Uttar Pradesh's holy city Varanasi, which Prime Minister Modi represents in Parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for Rs 75,000. He first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.Not far away from Varanasi, in Ghazipur, Bheem Singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. So much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as 50 per cent less than the market price for cows. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows any more. Anyone can come and beat us,"" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.The past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on Muslims and lower caste Hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. A group of alleged ""cow protectors"" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on May 26. Police in Rajasthan's Bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the RSS - the BJP's ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.Several state governments have appealed to the PM to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. Some have decided to drag the Centre to court. Environment minister Harsh Vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government's order. ""The aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle"" in the markets,"" he had said. But many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of Christians, Muslims and poor Hindus of a cheap source of protein.It's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section. But there has been a sudden surge since the BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in March with priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes.",general,2926,58,70

In its latest report, the World Bank has said, ""The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018."" According to the World Bank's latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.INDIA PICKING UPThe World Bank has pegged India's growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending. Writing in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, ""In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment."" According to the World Bank, ""India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.""CHINA SLIPSIn terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate. The World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing's slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.The World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of ""elevated domestic debt."" According to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration.

China bans Bieber from performing over bad behaviour,"?I just need one more shot, second chances,? Justin Bieber sings on his latest album. Not least, it seems, with Chinese authorities who have announced the Canadian pop idol will not be allowed to perform in the People?s Republic because of his on and offstage antics. Bieber will jet into Asia later this year as part of his Purpose World Tour with shows scheduled in Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Hong Kong. But Beliebers in mainland China look set to be disappointed. In a statement posted on its website this week, Beijing?s culture bureau explained that unspecified misdemeanours meant the artist, who has had repeated run-ins with the law - including for drunken drag racing in a yellow Lamborghini - was unsuitable for Chinese ears.?Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer,? said the bureau, which was answering a fan?s demand for a ?detailed explanation? about the former teen star?s absence from Chinese stages. ?As far as we are concerned, he has engaged in a series of bad behaviours, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China, which caused discontent among the public.?The bureau did not detail the exact behaviour that had landed Bieber in its bad books, saying only that in order to ?purify? China?s performing arts it had decided the singer?s exclusion was appropriate. The singer performed in China as part of his Believe tour, in 2013, raising eyebrows when he was pictured being carried up the Great Wall of China by his bodyguards. Bieber joins an illustrious list of foreign artists who have found themselves shut out of China?s potentially vast music industry, although most have been targeted for political, not behavioural reasons. In 2015 Los Angeles band Maroon 5 were forced to scrap shows in mainland China after the group?s keyboard player sent birthday wishes to the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. In 2009 Oasis were barred after guitarist Noel Gallagher performed at a Free Tibet concert in New York.His brother Liam now appears to have been forgiven and is scheduled to play solo shows in Beijing and Shenzhen next month. Beijing?s culture bureau made it clear it was not saying never to the Canadian artist: ?We hope Justin Bieber is able to improve his conduct as he grows up and will once again find public favour.?

Pak fears India may use flag at Attari for spying: Report,"India on Sunday hoisted the tallest tricolour in the country at the Attari border. The 360-foot tall flag is high enough to be spotted from Lahore in Pakistan. Hoisted on a 110-meter high mast, the flag is 120-foot long and 80-foot wide. The weight of the flag pole is 55 tonnes, and an estimated Rs 3.50 crore rupees have been spent on this project by the Punjab government.Before this, the title of the tallest national flag in India belonged to a 293-foot-high tricolour that was hoisted in Jharkhand's Ranchi. PAKISTAN OBJECTSInterestingly, Pakistan is not happy with India's decision to hoist the tricolour at the international border. Sources said the Pakistan Rangers had also conveyed their resentment to the Border Security Force (BSF) and had asked them to install the flag away from the border.Pakistan on Thursday had again raised an objection to the flag being flown at the IB, calling the act a violation of international treaties. Pakistan authorities apparently fear that India could use the mast to spy in Pakistani land by installing cameras on the flag pole.INDIA: NOT VIOLATING ANY TREATYHowever, Indian authorities had made it clear that the flat was being installed 200 metres before the zero line and was not a violation in any manner.""Not to my knowledge.

First chikungunya vaccine made from harmless virus,"Houston, Dec 20 (PTI) Scientists have developed the first vaccine for chikungunya fever made from an insect-specific virus that does not have any effect on people, making it safe and effective. The newly developed vaccine quickly produces a strong immune defence and completely protects mice and nonhuman primates from disease when exposed to the chikungunya virus, researchers said. ""This vaccine offers efficient, safe and affordable protection against chikungunya and builds the foundation for using viruses that only infect insects to develop vaccines against other insect-borne diseases,"" said Scott Weaver, professor at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in the US. Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a disease characterised by fever and severe joint pain, often in hands and feet, and may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Some patients will feel better within a week but many develop longer-term joint pain that can last up to years. Death is rare but can occur, researchers said. Traditionally, vaccine development involves trade-offs between how quickly the vaccine works and safety. Live-attenuated vaccines that are made from weakened versions of a live pathogen typically offer rapid and durable immunity but reduced safety. On the other hand, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of effectiveness, often requiring several doses and boosters to work properly. There may be a risk of disease with both of these vaccine types, either from incomplete inactivation of the virus or from incomplete or unstable weakening of the live virus that is only recognised when rare vulnerable individuals develop disease. To overcome these trade-offs, the researchers used the Eilat virus as a vaccine platform since it only infects insects and has no impact on people. The UTMB researchers used an Eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine containing chikungunya structural proteins. The Eilat/Chikungunya vaccine was found to be structurally identical to natural chikungunya virus. The difference is that although the hybrid virus replicates very well in mosquito cells, it cannot replicate in mammals.",general,2224,50,70

He started visiting her in the brothel in the guise of a customer, hoodwinking the kotha owner each time, and later they decided to get married and begin life afresh.When Shubhi told a few fellow sex-workers about it and tried to escape but failed, Sagar called the DCW helpline and told them their story. A huge contingent of police officers and DCW councilors raided the kotha on Thursday and brought the woman out.COUPLE TO TIE THE KNOT SOON The man says he has already convinced his family about the marriage and he will soon tie the knot with the woman he loves.DCW officials said the local police station will give her protection against any elements from her past life bothering her or trying to defame her now.A senior officer of DCW said, ""We got this call a few days ago from a man who said he is in love with a woman from GB Road.

Blind man jailed for raping blind woman in Gurugram,"A Gurgaon district court on Monday awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to a blind man, a trainee probationary officer at a public sector bank, who was found guilty of raping a 33-year-old blind widow repeatedly on the pretext of marriage. The court also imposed a penalty on convict Saurabh Kapoor, 35, who was convicted of rape under Section 376 of the IPC.Additional Sessions Judge Rajni Yadav, while pronouncing the quantum of sentence, said that given the inhumanity of the act, it was required to impose upon the convict substantive and stern sentence that would commensurate with the gravity of the offence and also serve as an example to others.It is to be noted that since both the victim and the accused were blind, the court had relied upon ?voice identification? that helped the woman to identify Kapoor, a resident of Mayur Vihar in Delhi.On the pretext of meeting an advocate, Kapoor had taken the victim on May 30, 2015, to a guest house in Gurgaon and raped her there for the first time. He later continued to abuse her, promising marriage.The victim, who has an eight-year-old daughter, worked in a private company in 2015, when the incident happened. She is currently unemployed.Public prosecutor Arvind Sharma said that the convict tried to seek leniency from the court on account of his blindness.?The accused also argued that he is a government servant and highly qualified, but all these arguments were rejected by the court, which awarded him 10 years of imprisonment,? said Sharma, adding that the court has imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000, out of which Rs 8,000 would go to the victim. The remaining Rs 2000 would go to the state. If the accused fail to pay the fine, he will face one more year of imprisonment.The judge, in her order, also stated that undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence to the accused would do more harm as it will undermine the public confidence.?Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not inclined to take a lenient view against him and release him on probation. He has raped a young woman who was helpless, defenceless, vulnerable and an easy prey who trusted the convict so much that she surrendered herself to him. He used, violated and exploited her body,? the court said.District attorney Lal Singh Yadav said the court has given a strong message to the society. ?The convict had sexually exploited the victim on the pretext of marriage,? he said.",general,2428,51,70

Student helps deliver baby on train; gets advice on WhatsApp,"A final year MBBS student turned to WhatsApp to seek instructions from his seniors while helping a woman give birth to a baby boy on Ahmedabad-Puri Express.What 24-year-old Vipin Khadse calls 'the most memorable moment of his life', happened when he was travelling from Akola to Napur. He posted about the incident on Facebook on World Health Day and described his fear when he saw the shoulder of the baby coming out first instead of the head.When the ticket collector came in his coach to ask about the availability of a doctor, he did not volunteer.

Due to political considerations, vested interests within the former SP and BSP regimes have hitherto wanted to deliberately keep education in a bad shape.""But, we have a different vision: we want to make education as the driver of the state's education in future and that needs some serious efforts.""Adopting schools personally will get each school adequate attention. Primary level is the formative level of education and we are trying to rebuild this level for a better superstructure,"" said UP BJP spokesperson Chandra MohanMoreover, the UP government seems to have found itself in an advantageous position as the BJP at the Centre is also celebrating its three years in power.The coincidence of the two have allowed the state government to enumerate among its own the efforts of the Union government in UP.""We are taking the achievements of the Yogi government to the people of UP by means of local gatherings called the 'Jan Kalyan Sammelan' in all the mandals of the state.These programmes started from Sunday.

Nintendo admits its cartridge purposely made to taste bitter,"The Nintendo Switch is a mixed-use, family friendly console and its games come on little proprietary memory cards. Those cards have been with reviewers for a week or so now and, while information about the games on them may still be embargoed, it has emerged the cartridges themselves taste horrendously bitter.History does not definitively record who first thought it a necessary part of their review to lick one, but someone did. Kids (and game reviewers?) being kids, and therefore inclined to stick anything they can in their mouths, Nintendo confirmed it has tried to do worried parents everywhere a favour and reduce the chances of the SD card-sized cartridges from being swallowed.A Nintendo spokesperson told gaming site Kotaku: ?To avoid the possibility of accidental ingestion, keep the game card away from young children. A bittering agent (denatonium benzoate) has also been applied to the game card.? This bittering agent ?is non-toxic?, it stresses.Denatonium is one of the extremely bitter tasting chemicals used in anti-nail biting treatments, among other things. The Guardian?s Alex Hern taste-tested the Switch launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and can report, it is indeed ?gross?.I just licked Zelda because of this and yup, can confirm: is gross https://t.co/4x3TQn9Ym9?I wasn?t expecting the rumours to be true, so took a fairly meaty lick of the top half of the cartridge, and it rapidly proved to be a mistake,?

BMC polls: Shiv Sena's tally rises to 87 as 3 join party,"A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls threw up a hung verdict, Shiv Sena's tally of corporators rose to 87 today with three party rebels who won as Independent nominees returning to its fold. This gave a slight push to Uddhav Thackeray's efforts to cobble up numbers but reaching the magic figure of 114 seats needed to rule the cash-rich civic body is still a far cry. The development came at a time when both the Sena and its estranged ally BJP which has won 82 seats, are keeping cards close to their chest on the prospects of coming together again to attain power or otherwise. While Snehal More (Vikhroli) and Tulsiram Shinde (Dindoshi) arrived at Matoshree, the Bandra residence of Thackeray, in morning where they were reinducted, Changez Multani (Andheri) extended his support in evening.

However, the resurgent BJP breached the Sena citadel of Mumbai and bagged 82 seats, just two less than Sena's Friday tally of 84. It remains unclear whether the saffron siblings will join the hands again or new combinations will emerge to secure 114 seats. BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari on Friday said the final decision pertaining to the BMC will be taken by core committee of the party, which is meeting here in the evening.

Distraught with the apathy of the authorities, the jawan has said that there was no assistance from both the police and the Haryana government.""He didn't approach the government, he shared the issue on social media.

However, we assure that if proven we will suspend the police personnel who refused to take the jawan's complaint,"" said Dhal.He added that the government will take stern action against encroachments and violations by liquor mafia.After the jawan's video went viral, Army ordered an inquiry into the case.""We protect motherland, but are unable to protect our own mother,"" soldier reportedly told army sources.Also Read:Jaipur: Angered over sale of illicit liquor, locals hurl alcohol bottles on streets Madhya Pradesh: 70 villages impose self prohibition against sale of liquor in state",general,2775,50,70

China to build its first Mars simulation base near Tibet,"China plans to build its first Mars simulation base on the Tibetan plateau in the country?s northwest as it aims to send the first mission to the red planet by 2020 to catch-up with the US, India and Russia.An agreement to build a ?Mars village? at Haixi prefecture in Qinghai province, a part of the Tibetan plateau located next to Tibet Autonomous Region, was signed yesterday, state-run China News Service reported.The region on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau is known for its sharp ridges and mounds of rock, known as yardangs, formed over the centuries by wind erosion.

Oscar-winning actor Martin Landau passes away aged 89,"Martin Landau, the chameleon-like actor who gained fame as the crafty master of disguise in the 1960s TV show Mission: Impossible, then capped a long and versatile career with an Oscar for his poignant portrayal of aging horror movie star Bela Lugosi in 1994?s Ed Wood, has died. He was 89.Landau died Saturday of unexpected complications during a short stay at UCLA Medical Centre, his publicist Dick Guttman said.Mission: Impossible, which also starred Landau?s wife, Barbara Bain, became an immediate hit upon its debut in 1966. It remained on the air until 1973, but Landau and Bain left at the end of the show?s third season amid a financial dispute with the producers. They starred in the British-made sci-fi series Space: 1999 from 1975 to 1977.Academy award winning actor Martin Landau sits on his new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as he poses for photographers during ceremonies to honour him, in Hollywood, December 17, 2001. (REUTERS) Landau might have been a superstar but for a role he didn?t play - the pointy-eared starship Enterprise science officer, Mr. Spock. Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry had offered him the half-Vulcan, half-human who attempts to rid his life of all emotion. Landau turned it down.?A character without emotions would have driven me crazy; I would have had to be lobotomized,? he explained in 2001. Instead, he chose Mission: Impossible, and Leonard Nimoy went on to everlasting fame as Spock.Ironically, Nimoy replaced Landau on Mission: Impossible.After a brief but impressive Broadway career, Landau had made an auspicious film debut in the late 1950s, playing a soldier in Pork Chop Hill and a villain in the Alfred Hitchcock classic North By Northwest.He enjoyed far less success after Mission: Impossible, however, finding he had been typecast as Rollin Hand, the top-secret mission team?s disguise wizard. His film career languished for more than a decade, reaching its nadir with his appearance in the 1981 TV movie The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan?s Island.Actor Martin Landau holds the Screen Actors Guild Award he won for outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role for his role in the film Ed Wood at the first-ever televised awards show for the organization in Los Angeles. (REUTERS) He began to find redemption with a sympathetic role in Tucker: The Man and his Dream, the 1988 Francis Ford Coppola film that garnered Landau his first Oscar nomination.He was nominated again the next year for his turn as the adulterous husband in Woody Allen?s Crimes and Misdemeanors.His third nomination was for Ed Wood, director Tim Burton?s affectionate tribute to a man widely viewed as the worst Hollywood filmmaker of all time.?There was a 10-year period when everything I did was bad. I?d like to go back and turn all those films into guitar picks,? Landau said after accepting his Oscar.In Ed Wood, he portrayed Lugosi during his final years, when the Hungarian-born actor who had become famous as Count Dracula was ill, addicted to drugs and forced to make films with Ed Wood just to pay his bills. A gifted mimic trained in method acting, Landau had thoroughly researched the role.Actor Martin Landau arrives for the European premiere of the film Frankenweenie at the Odeon Leicester Square in central London October 10, 2012. (REUTERS) ?I watched about 35 Lugosi movies, including ones that were worse than anything Ed Wood ever made,? he recalled in 2001. ?Despite the trash, he had a certain dignity about him, whatever the role.?So did the New York-born Landau, who had studied drawing at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and worked for a time as a New York Daily News cartoonist before switching careers at age 22.He had dabbled in acting before the switch, making his stage debut in 1951 at a Maine summer theatre in Detective Story and off-Broadway in First Love.In 1955, he was among hundreds who applied to study at the prestigious Actors Studio and one of only two selected. The other was Steve McQueen.On Broadway, Landau won praise for his work in Middle of the Night, which starred Edward G Robinson.

Manmohan termed Jallikattu cruel in 2015; Cong backs it now,"The Congress party may have opposed jalikattu with its full force but today it stands a divided house. Even as party chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala walks a cautious line there are leaders like Digvijaya Singh who outrightly support it. But what puts Congress in a spot is a letter accessed exclusively by India Today written by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh while in opposition expressing strong disapproval for this age old Tamil tradition that has become the focus of the country's polity now.The letter is dated December 15, 2015 when the Congress was in opposition and Dr Singh seized to be the Prime Minister. This letter was written in the capacity of a Rajya Sabha MP to NG Jayasimha,the Managing Director of Humane Society International (India). Humane Society argued strongly against Jalikattu like many other organisations like People for Ethical Treatment to Animal or PETA that is at the receiving end of people's ire in Tamil Nadu today. In the said letter Dr Manmohan Singh remarked, ""The Human Society International/India affiliate has a worthy objective and certainly we have to discourage bullfights which provide a cruel form of entertainment"". Dr Singh didn't stop there but went on to ""wish you all success in achieving your objective"" of getting bull fight which is popularly known as jalikattu banned.This letter is in sync with the views expressed by many ministers in the UPA regime like Jairam Ramesh. But come today the scenario is absolutely different. A popular uprising along the Marina Beach of Chennai in demand of the sport that Tamils call an inherent part of their culture has forced many political parties to modulate their views. Congress' Chief Spokesman Randeep Surjewala in a tweet put the onus on the centre and taking a neutral view much away from Manmohan Singh's militant opinion on jalikattu said, ""Congress respects people of Tamil Nadu in preserving the culture & tradition of Jallikattu more so as adequate safety precautions is taken. People have a legitimate right to protect their pride & conserve their culture. Govt's duty to strike a balance & respect the sentiments."" Something that was 'cruel entertainment' in 2015 turned into a 'legitimate right' in January 2017 for Congress, thanks to the popular mood.Well that is not all. Even as Surjewala tries to undo the damage, its another Spokesperson and a senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi doubles up as the counsel for the petitioners calling for a ban on the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu. According to him, Jallikattu is not a sport, it is a ""brutal and wanton"" torture of an animal and that since holding Jallikattu is not permissible under law after the Supreme Court order, even supporting or encouraging it is defiance of the Supreme Court order. So as jalikattu debate rages on, the Congress is a divided house with no single school of thought. It's general secretary supports it, it's media chief maintains a neutral view as another leader fights for the ones it's own party is not ready to openly back. And amid all these the letter bomb is surely going to put the grand old party in an even more uncomfortable spot.",general,3146,59,70
When was the last major India-China stand-off?,"The last time India and China were engaged in a major military stand-off in Sikkim was in 1967.On that instance, just five years after India's traumatic 1962 war defeat, the Indian Army gave the Chinese a bloody nose, according to accounts from the time. More than 80 Indian soldiers were killed, while estimates say between 300 to 400 Chinese troops were killed.It was certainly a different time: One account suggests that to protest China's actions then in Sikkim, which reportedly included a Chinese complaint of a herd of sheep being stolen, a 43-year-old Member of Parliament by the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee drove a herd of sheep to the Chinese Embassy in Shantipath in New Delhi to stage a rather colourful protest.There are fascinating parallels from the 1967 incident. That was also a stand-off that began with pushing and shoving, when the Chinese filled up trenches that India had dug.That stand-off was also marked by Chinese irritation at the Indian Army's presence in the then Kingdom of Sikkim. This month's stand-off, in the Doklam plateau contested by China and Bhutan, has reflected China's annoyance with the Indian Army's presence in Bhutan. China's government said this week that Bhutan was ""a sovereign country"" and no ""third party"" should interfere.""The Chinese were not comfortable with Sikkim being an Indian protectorate with the deployment of the Indian Army at that time,"" recalled Maj Gen Sheru Thapliyal (retd), who was in 1967 posted in nearby Sebu La and later commanded the Nathu La brigade.As he wrote in an essay published in 2004 in Force magazine and later published by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies, the stand-off began as engineers and jawans started erecting long iron pickets from Nathu La to Sebu La along the perceived border, which was agreed by both sides under the 1890 treaty between Great Britain and Qing Dynasty China. A scuffle began as China objected to the laying of the wire, and the PLA Political Commissar was roughed up.The Chinese returned days later. ""A whistle was heard on the Chinese side followed by murderous medium machine gun fire from north shoulder. The pass is completely devoid of cover and the jawans of 70 Field Company and 18 Rajput were caught in the open and suffered heavy casualties which included Col Rai Singh who was wounded. Two brave officers - Capt Dagar of 2 Grenadiers and Major Harbhajan Singh of 18 Rajput rallied a few troops and tried to assault the Chinese MMG but both died a heroic death,"" recalled Maj Gen Thapliyal.He adds, ""On 14 September 1967, Chinese threatened use of Air Force if shelling did not stop. By then the lesson had been driven home and an uneasy ceasefire came about. The Chinese, true to form, had pulled over dead bodies to their side of the perceived border at night and accused us of violating the border. Dead bodies were exchanged on 15 September at which time: Sam Manekshaw, [then Eastern Army Commander], Aurora [Lt Gen Jagjit Aurora, Corps Commander] and Sagat [Maj Gen Sagat Singh, GOC Mountain Division in Sikkim] were present on the Pass.""He recalled the situation ""again flared up twenty days later when on 1 October 1967 a face-off between India and China took place at Cho La, another pass on the Sikkim-Tibet border a few kilometers north of Nathu La"".""Despite initial casualties, 7/11 GR and 10 JAK RIF stood firm and forced the Chinese to withdraw nearly three kilometers away to a feature named Kam Barracks where they remain deployed till date. Cho La Pass is firmly in Indian hands. Indian Army had got better of the Chinese yet again.""He wrote, ""No wonder, Sino-Indian border has remained peaceful ever since to the extent that today Chinese soldiers come and ask their Indian counterparts at Nathu La for cigarettes, rum and tea, mail is exchanged twice in a week in a hut constructed specially for this purpose and border personnel meeting takes place there twice a year.""The 1967 incident marked the last incident of casualties on both sides in the Sikkim sector. And the last death in any sector of the India-China border was in 1975 at Tulung La, and that was by accident, when two patrols were lost in the fog. So despite the close parallels, 50 years on history is unlikely to repeat itself with the border remaining largely tranquil in the decades since.Also Read:Chinese media on border stand-off: 1962 defeat has left lingering effect on India",general,4396,46,70

Playstation games inspired youngsters to become carjackers,"A gang of four alleged carjackers, who learnt how to rob cars while playing their favourite game, Grand Theft Auto, on Playstation, was on Tuesday busted by Delhi Police crime branch. This gang allegedly committed five back-to-back car robberies within 48 hours in Delhi. Two adult members, including the kingpin Lokesh Shokeen, 22, were arrested and their two alleged juvenile accomplices apprehended. They were behind a series of carjacking incidents in west, northwest and outer Delhi. The other arrested man is Deepak alias Changa, 27. Five robbed four-wheelers, including two SUVs, I-phone 6 and other items, were recovered from them.Madhur Verma, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that except one alleged juvenile carjacker, a habitual offender previously involved in similar cases, all other apprehended carjackers were first-timers. They entered the world of crime to earn quick bucks and to live a lavish lifestyle. ?The gang members robbed cars and high-end mobile phones and used to thrash the occupants if they resisted. The four said while playing the Grand Theft Auto games, they hit upon the idea that they could get hold of luxury cars easily like the characters in the games by thrashing the occupants,? said Verma. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Ravindra Yadav said that in the first week of February 2017, five carjackings were reported on one night. In one incident in Model Town, the carjackers robbed a Fortuner SUV after mercilessly attacking its driver with a baseball bat. ?The car driver sustained multiple injuries in his head. He was admitted to Sant Parmanand Hospital where he is still battling for his life,? said Yadav. The gang targeted luxury cars driven by a single person. They used to target a particular car, followed it closely and at a convenient place, deliberately banged the car with their car, compelling the driver to stop. ?The gang members travelled in cars with tinted glasses so that they can?t be seen from outside.?Shokeen was the first to be arrested from Rohini Sector 16 with a robbed Fortuner. His interrogation led to the arrest of Deepak and apprehension of the two minor boys and recovery of four other cars.",general,2184,58,70
"Miners find 8,500 kg gold on 'sacred' land in New Zealand","A bitter stand-off between a local community and miners has emerged after a significant seam of gold was found on protected conservation land in New Zealand?s North Island.Last week New Talisman Gold Mines reported they had found a large vein of gold in the Karangahake Gorge in the North Island; 8,500kg of highest quality gold which put it in the top five percent of deposits worldwide when ranked on grade, according to the company.The find is believed to be worth tens of millions of New Zealand dollars.Talisman?s general manager of operations Wayne Chowles said the company planned to begin extracting small amounts of gold early next year, but locals in opposition to the scheme have sprung into action, saying the mining project threatens the ?peace and harmony? of their ?sacred? mountain and community.The Karangahake Gorge lies on protected department of conservation land in the Coromandel peninsula and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Located one and a half hour?s drive from Auckland and 55 minutes from Hobbiton, the scenic gorge is famed for its rich history and lush natural beauty.But now the mining company and walkers are forced to share one narrow access road to the mountain.Chowles said there would be ?flow-down? benefits to the local community, and the footprint of the mining company in the reserve was ?small? at just 0.4 of a hectare with 95 percent of the proposed mining activity taking place underground. The company says the mine?s water supply was also processed through a ?closed loop system?. ?We do not believe that our activities have, or will, significantly disrupt the peace and beauty of the gorge,? said Chowles.. But some locals stridently disagree. Ruby Jane Powell is a member of the protest group Protect Karangahake. The group has been opposing any mining action in the gorge for a number of years, but have ?doubled their efforts? this week to protect the land, sending dozens of protestors to block the access road, or slow down prospecting efforts by sending ?very slow walkers? to clog up the road and prevent vehicle access. ?We don?t want to take direct action but we are left with no choice, the government and the department of conservation have failed to protect this treasured land,? said Powell. ?It is a really popular recreation area, and the local water source is taken down-stream from the mine. In general our culture and economy is really interlinked with the eco-tourism and outdoor aspect of life in the Coromandel, and mining threatens that,? said Powell. The government and the department of conservation have failed to protect this treasured landPowell said communication between the community and New Talisman had broken down. ?The reality is that gold-mining makes money for a few people, but we are the ones that pay the cost, we will have to live with a degraded environment and an altered sense of peace in the mountain.?Green Party MP Catherine Delahunty said industrial scale gold mining on Karangahake mountain would ?turn a beautiful recreational park and sacred mountain into an industrial zone?.?This is public land which has been set aside to protect its ecological values and for recreation. It is a sacred mountain to the indigenous people of the area and local residents are actively and peacefully opposing the initial development of the mining activity on the mountain.?The New Zealand Government is also hell bent on opening up conservation areas to mining but they do not have a mandate to destroy our precious places ?New Talisman were granted a 25-year mining permit to prospect and mine on conservation land in Karangahake in 2009, using an existing underground mine that has been in operation at various times between 1892 and 1992. It is legal to mine on conservation land in New Zealand if the government and local council grant a permit and if land access is given from the department of conservation.As of May there were 43 active mines on conservation land in New Zealand, according to the ministry of business, innovation and employment.New Talisman have all the consents they need and the government insists mining activity won?t affect the historic gorge. The only thing standing in their path is local opposition.Powell has vowed to keep up the fight. ?We will continue to put our bodies on the line to stop New Talisman working in the mountain,? she said.Note: This article has been updated to add in extra information provided on Talisman?s mine.",world,4473,57,70

The crowd cheered, whistled and whooted as she sat down to speak about her views on stardom and how it takes true grit to be a superstar.Turns out it was Katrina Kaif's first time in Assam.

World's oldest fungus discovered in South Africa,"London, Apr 26 (PTI) Scientists have discovered what may be the worlds oldest fungus in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years. The fossils suggest that fungus may have evolved from under the deep sea rather than land. Drilled from rocks that were once beneath the seafloor, the fossils resemble living fungi and could push back the date for the oldest fungi by one to two billion years. If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that has not been described before, scientists say. ""The deep biosphere where the fossils were found represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history,"" said Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Sweden who led the research team. The fossils closely resemble those found in similar conditions on land. They are made up of jumbles of tangled threads some hundredths of a millimetre thick. There is a ""clear possibility"" that they are the worlds oldest fossil fungi - twice as old as generally accepted in the fossil record, Bengtson was quoted as saying by the BBC News.",world,1145,48,70

Chopper flying critically low led to 2015 Bombay High crash,"Two years after a helicopter crash near the Bombay High offshore oil field killed two pilots, an inquiry by the Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) found that the chopper was flying at a critically low height, without the pilots realising it. The Pawan Hans helicopter was on a training sortie on the evening of November 4, 2015. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had asked AAIB?to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry report, which was made public on Wednesday, said that the main pilot was flying low and that the other did not realise it. After taking off, the Rontappmeyer (RYTYR) helicopter may have faced difficulties as the moon was waning, the report said. The report mentioned that the instructor, Captain E Samuel, wasn?t disoriented and was aware of the low height of the helicopter. He alerted Captain TK Guha a little late, but even after realising that Guha wasn?t able to manage the situation, Samuel did not take control of the helicopter.AAIB recommended that ONGC, which owns Bombay High along with the helicopter operators, identify helidecks from where night flying can take place. AAIB also said that Pawan Hans pilots need to rest sufficiently before flying. Guha was flying during the night after a gap of almost a year, read the report.

Delhi Police to train 2400 underprivileged youngsters,"In an effort to make an inclusive society, Delhi Police has been training more than 2400 young adults, in the 14 to 25 age group, in different vocational skills. As part of project YUVA, these youngsters have been shortlisted from 3500 children and youngsters, from the economically weaker sections of the society. ?Children and youngsters who are living in JJ clusters, including those who are school dropouts and get addicted to drugs are also part of the skill training program. Those , whose family members are involved in crimes, and have no one else in the family to financially support are also part of this program. These youngsters are basically from economically weaker sections and resort to crimes because of lack of resources to earn a living,? says Madhur Verma, DCP (Crime) and PRO, Delhi Police. This initiative of Delhi Police is in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). ?Both the institutions ? CII and NSDC ? will provide skill training as well as job opportunities to these youngsters. Usually such training used to take place at one centre in the city but this time, we have designated several centres including 20 police stations,? adds Verma.

They commit crimes because they don?t have jobs and because they lack skills. NSDC is implementing Pradhanmantri Vikas Yojana and providing training to the ones under this initiative of Delhi Police. If not 100 per cent, we will try to provide jobs to at least 70 per cent of the trainees under this scheme.?The selection of candidates has been made on the grounds of seriousness towards bringing a change in their personality and the society at large. ?There?s no point in training someone who isn?t serious about changing oneself. The training is in different sections, from plumbing and construction to painting walls. Officially, the programme will be inaugurated on July 15 or 16,? adds the NSDC spokesperson. ?We have been experimenting with the individuals, in their own way, for quite some time now.

Man accused of laundering over $4 bn in Bitcoin arrested,"The Russian ?internationally sought ?mastermind? of a crime organisation? accused of laundering more than $4bn in bitcoin, including funds obtained from the hack of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, has been arrested in Greece.A US jury indicted Alexander Vinnik on Wednesday after his arrest in a small beachside village in northern Greece on Tuesday, following an investigation led by the US justice department along with several other federal agencies and task forces.Vinnik was described by the justice department as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade the digital currency bitcoin since 2011, which was allegedly used to launder more than $4bn for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking.US authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt Gox, the Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. Vinnik ?obtained? funds from the hack of Mt Gox and laundered them through BTC-e and Tradehill, another San Francisco-based exchange he owned, they said in the statement.?Just as new computer technologies continue to change the way we engage each other and experience the world, so too will criminals subvert these new technologies to serve their own nefarious purposes,? said Brian Stretch, US attorney for the Northern District of California.Vinnik?s arrest is the latest in a series of US operations against Russian cybercriminals in Europe, including the taking down of two of the biggest dark web marketplaces for drugs, guns and other illicit items, AlphaBay and Hansa, last week.The prosecutions also coincide with intensified scrutiny of Russian hackers after US intelligence officials determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election using cyber-warfare methods to help Donald Trump, something Moscow denies.During his time in the digital currency market, US authorities allege Vinnik facilitated crimes including hacking, fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud, public corruption and drug trafficking. Greek police described Vinnik as a ?an internationally sought ?mastermind? of a crime organisation?. BTC-e, which has been out of service for more than a day, attributed this to ?unplanned maintenance?. In a tweet on Wednesday after the arrest of Vinnik, BTC-e said it would restore service in the next five to 10 days.The exchange is one of the oldest virtual currency platforms. It allows users to trade bitcoin pseudonymously against a variety of fiat and virtual currencies, and is known in cryptocurrency markets as having relaxed standards for checking users? identity, and for not collaborating with law enforcement.",technology,2631,56,70

AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal booked for molestation,"Delhi Police have registered an FIR against AAP legislator from Deoli, Prakash Jarwal, after a 53-year-old woman filed a complaint accusing the MLA of touching her inappropriately and threatening her.The FIR registered on Wednesday is the second such case against him. In July 2016, a woman had made similar allegations against Jarwal. In her complaint, the woman alleged that on July 19, MCD officials had come to demolish an illegal construction near her house. She alleged that at the time, Jarwal came to her house along with around 40 persons and said that her son had abused him. The MLA threatened to sack her husband, who works with the Delhi Jal Board, and also touched her inappropriately, the complaint said. ?In the recent MCD elections, my son had danced in a rally of another party. A local councillor saw him and there was a quarrel. They called Jarwal and his goons. We had an argument with the MLA and the police were called. We reached a compromise then, but since then, we are being harassed,? the woman told Hindustan Times. The MLA, meanwhile, said that the charges were ?politically motivated.? ?The woman is a BJP worker and president of the block. Her husband and son had troubled our candidate some months ago during the MCD election. Our candidate had also filed a complaint, but it was withdrawn later. Her son and husband had abused us while we were celebrating our win after the election. And now, she is making these baseless allegations,? Jarwal said.Police sources said the woman had a similar altercation with the area councillor some months ago. ?The police have not even told me that a case has been registered against me. I know they won?t call me for interrogation, they will just arrest me,? Jarwal said, adding that the woman was a ?BJP volunteer? who wanted to make ?political gains?.He said that though he was near the woman?s house on July 14, it was the woman and her family members who had abused him.

India remains one of fastest-growing nations in world: US,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, Dec 15 (PTI) India remains one of the fastest-growing countries in the world, the White House today said even as it underlined that inefficiencies remain in the public sector of the country with the poor population still lacking healthcare coverage and access to financial services. ""India remains one of the fastest-growing countries in the world, with real GDP expanding at 7.3 per cent in the four quarters through 2016:Q3,"" said the Economic Report of the President for the year 2017, which was sent to the Congress. The voluminous report running into nearly 600 pages says that economic growth in India continues at a solid pace of a projected 7.4 per cent over the four quarters of 2016. ""Private consumption has been a major driver in economic growth, contributing 4.3 percentage points to its 7.3 per cent real GDP growth rate in the four quarters through 2016:Q3,"" the report said, adding that lower inflation and fiscal consolidation over the past year has created additional policy space for India to stimulate growth should a crisis occur. ""Macroeconomic risks revolve around inflationary pressure stemming from increasing commodity prices, which could weigh on the current account and fiscal deficit,"" it said. ""Inefficiencies remain in the public sector, with Indias poor still lacking healthcare coverage, educational attainment, and access to financial services. Further, inequality in India remains high,"" the White House report said. The report also noted the countries that export to China and the advanced economies have suffered due to the slowdown in those important markets, the report added. ""Economic growth in China has been on a downward trend since a brief rebound after the global financial crisis. China has been attempting to re-balance from an investment- and export-driven economy to an economy driven more by private consumption,"" it said. The White House said as Chinas economy grew to 15 per cent of global GDP in 2015, targeted industrial policies have made it the worlds largest manufacturer and the dominant producer of some key goods in the global marketplace, as well as a major source of demand for an array of goods, magnifying the effects of changes in its domestic economy on global prices and growth.",world,2276,57,70
Joshua defeats Klitschko to be crowned triple world champ,"Anthony Joshua delivered one of the great nights in British boxing annals by stopping Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round to be crowned IBF, WBA and IBO world heavyweight champion in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Britain's unbeaten IBF title holder earned a sensational victory by knocking down the 41-year-old former champion twice in the 11th and penultimate round before the referee stepped in to save Klitschko from any more punishment.What was hailed as the biggest fight night ever staged in a British ring, watched by the largest crowd for a boxing show in Britain for 78 years, lived up to its billing.It was a thrilling contest which saw both combatants clamber off the canvas seemingly on the verge of defeat and looks destined to be recalled as one of the great heavyweight title fights.Joshua survived a knockdown for the first time in his professional career in the sixth round and looked close to surrendering his unbeaten record until his late bombardment forced the stoppage.In a sensational fifth round, Joshua knocked down Klitschko only to end up hanging on desperately at the end of the round as the Ukrainian launched a remarkable comeback.The veteran had even looked the more likely winner as he defied a 14-year age gap and was outboxing Joshua in the latter stages until the Briton produced a blistering finish to take his unbeaten record to 19 straight stoppage wins.Both men had to dig deep and both looked close to exhaustion before the 27-year-old Joshua's youth, fitness and sheer power took over in a penultimate round that sent the huge crowd into ecstasy as two barrages sent Klitschko down.""What can I say? 19-0, three-and-a-half years in the game. As I said, I'm not perfect but I'm trying,"" Joshua told the cheering crowd from the ring.""As boxing states, you leave your ego at the door and you respect your opponent. So a massive shout out to Wladimir Klitschko.""""The best man won tonight and it's a massive event for boxing,"" responded Klitschko after his second defeat in succession at the hands of a British heavyweight following the loss of his titles to Tyson Fury 17 months ago after an 11-year reign.""Two gentleman fought each other. Anthony was better today. It's really sad I didn't make it.""The fight attracted a gate that had not been matched for a British show since Len Harvey fought Jock McAvoy for the British light-heavyweight title at another London venue, White City, in 1939.The mutual praise between Joshua and Klitschko echoed the civilised and respectful way the two former Olympic champions had behaved in the build-up to the contest but there was nothing civil about the brutal punishment they dished out to each other.After four rounds of feeling each other out, with Klitschko's movement and Joshua's power quite apparent, the crowd were not prepared for an astonishing fifth round.First, Joshua launched a blistering left hook and followed up with a flurry of punches that saw the Ukrainian drop to his knees and, when he rose groggily, take a standing count.Klitschko suddenly looked old and the end seemed nigh as Joshua roared in to finish the job but that was when he found his champion's spirit in his desperation, landing a big left of his own to leave Joshua in real peril.",world,3275,57,70
Sena slams Centre over inaction against K'taka flag demand,"For the first time after Shiv Sena almost lost its grip on its bastion of Mumbai in the civic polls earlier this year, party chief Uddhav Thackeray accepted that they didn?t fare as well as they expected.In the concluding part of this three-part interview in Sena?s mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray said like everyone else even he believed that the Shiv Sena would win more than 100 of the 227 seats. He also blamed non-Marathi Hindus for the party?s low tally and said they rallied behind the BJP. After a bitter battle with the BJP, the Shiv Sena won 84 seats in the country?s richest municipal corporation and the BJP got 82. This was the first time in 25 years that any party had come so close to the Shiv Sena?s tally in Mumbai. In a discussion with Sena MP and executive editor of Saamana, Sanjay Raut, he said, ?In Mumbai?s case, the Marathi-speaking voters definitely stayed with the Shiv Sena. My party is really grateful to them.?He added, ?I just really feel bad about one thing. In 1992-93 riots in Mumbai did not spread as per civic wards. Wherever there was unrest, being Hindu the Shiv Sainiks saved every one by putting their lives at stake. I don?t think it is right to vote out those who have helped you in times of crisis.?Thackeray said several Shiv Sainiks are still battling criminal cases because they rushed to protect the Hindus of Mumbai and in return none of those expressed any gratitude to Shiv Sainiks. ?We don?t expect them to say thank you, but they should have remembered that it was Sena that saved them. Even today, I saved Mumbai?s octroi revenue from being washed out by the Goods and Services Tax. I didn?t do that only for the Marathi population in the city. I did it for the entire city,? Thackeray said.The Sena chief also hinted that mid-term polls in Maharashtra are unlikely despite increasingly choppy relations between the ruling parties. ?I don?t pay attention to empty threats from all over. BJP president Amit Shah visited Matoshree and clearly told me there won?t be any mid-term polls,? he said. Thackeray also criticised the Modi government, which Sena is a part of, for not taking a strict view of the Karnataka government?s ?offensive? demand for a separate flag. He also called for sedition charges to be slapped on the state. ?Unfortunately, I am the only one speaking out here. No one in other states or in the country is bothered. If I were to say the same thing about Maharashtra, people would have criticised us from all over.?",politics,2484,58,70
Mufti govt opposes creation of minority commission in J&K,"In a setback to the minority Hindu and Sikh communities in Jammu and Kashmir, the Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP-BJP government in the state, through an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, has opposed creation of a minority commission in the state.The state government was responding to a PIL filed by a Jammu-based lawyer Ankur Sharma, seeking a direction to set up a minority commission in the state to safeguard the interests of religious and linguistic minorities. ""In the absence of a minority commission, the benefits exclusively meant for the minority communities including crores worth aid are being given away to a certain community, which is the majority Muslim community, in an illegal and arbitrary manner,"" Sharma had submitted.Jammu and Kashmir law secretary Abdul Majid Bhat contended that Sharma's view, saying, ""Assertion of the petitioner for setting up a state minority commission in Jammu and Kashmir through proper legislation including time-bound identification and notification of religious and linguistic minorities by the state is legally not maintainable. It is up to the concerned state/Union territory to set up a minority commission in their respective state/Union territory.""'The Jammu and Kashmir government said law is well settled on the issue that the apex court cannot direct the government to legislate on a particular subject. ""It is for the state legislature to consider in its wisdom as to which laws are required to be made considering the circumstances prevailing in the state,"" the state government said.ALSO READ| Jammu-Kashmir: Mehbooba Mufti stands firm on Article 370 commentsQuestioning the PIL petitioner's motive, the affidavit said: ""As per information available, the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa, Sikkim, Andaman, and several UTs have not set up a minority commission. The present petition only seeks its establishment in Jammu and Kashmir. In case the present petition has been filed in public interest, he should have prayed for its setting up in all these states.""According to the 2011 census, about 68.3 per cent of the state's population is Muslims. Among the minorities, 28.4 per cent are Hindus, followed by Sikhs (1.9 per cent), Buddhists (0.9 per cent), and Christians (0.3 per cent). In Kashmir valley, about 96.4 per cent are Muslims, followed by Hindus (2.45 per cent), Sikhs (0.98 per cent) and others (0.17 per cent).Sharma argued that Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir are unable to benefit from central and state welfare schemes for minorities. The Union government indirectly recognises Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Christians of Jammu and Kashmir as 'minorities'.This is in spite of the fact that the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, is not applicable to J-K and thus the recognition of Muslims as ""minorities"" is whimsical and illegal, the plea said. The Union Ministry of Minority Affairs has awarded 717 out of the 753 available scholarships to the majority community in Jammu and Kashmir, it said.ALSO READ| We have to differentiate between militants, their families: Mehbooba MuftiConstitutional guarantees under Article 29 and 30 (rights of minorities) are no guarantees at all in Jammu and Kashmir due to the government's failure to identify religious and linguistic minorities and declare them as notified minorities, said the PIL.Rights and benefits due to the minorities are being siphoned off arbitrarily and illegally, it added.",politics,3492,57,70
No more permissions for casinos in Goa: CM Parrikar,"Panaji, Jul 24 (PTI) Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar today assured the House that no more permissions for casinos -? on land and off shore -? would be granted in the state. Parrikar also told the state legislative assembly that the legislation which was enacted in the year 2012 banning entry of Goans on off shore casinos would be implemented with certain changes in the next three months. In yet another announcement, Parrikar also said that the number of off shore casinos in Mandovi river would be capped to existing five vessels, which would be shifted to land in next three years. The chief minister was responding to various issues related to casinos raised by opposition benches during demands for grants for Home portfolio on the floor of the House. Parrikar pointed out that during his tenure in the year 2012, he had passed a legislation which allowed only tourists to visit the off shore casinos. ""The legislation never came into force after that,"" he said. Parrikar said that in the existing act, the state government has power to cap the number of casinos in a particular area. ""We will use these powers capping the number of off shore casinos in Mandovi river to only five which are existing. The sixth casino will not be allowed,"" he said. ""The sixth off shore casino can go somewhere else and can operate only if people of the area dont have a problem,"" he said. Parrikar also assured the House that the amendment to the Prevention of Gambling Act would be made during next assembly session which will ensure that all the casinos in river Mandovi cease to exist after three years. ""We will delete the clause that allows casino on vessel.

Bill to increase Parliament sittings to 100 days tabled,"At a time when public cynicism about the country's parliamentarians is at an all time high, there is one MP, who believes that the members of Parliament need to work much harder.He is Naresh Gujral, the Akali Dal MP in the Rajya Sabha. Gujral believes that Parliament needs to meet more often than it does now. Gujral has tabled a private member's Bill, the Parliament Enhancement of Productivity Bill, asking for Parliament to must meet at least for 100 days a year.The Bill could not have come at a more opportune moment. Adjournments are fast becoming a norm rather than an aberration. Complete sessions have been washed out without transacting any business inside the Houses and outside a Shiv Sena MP has made the news for beating up an Air India official.Gujral's Bill, if adopted by the government, could go some distance in not only making Parliament a lot more productive but it will also help redeem the MPs in the eye of the public.WHY THE BILL IS SIGNIFICANTIn addition to making it mandatory for Parliament to sit at least for a hundred days a year, spread over four sessions, it also calls for the convening of a special session of both houses for fifteen days. The special session as envisaged by Gujral will not have either the question hour or the zero hour but will be devoted exclusively to taking up two issues of utmost public importance. It has a provision for each political party submitting at least two issues before the business advisory committee that it wants to be taken up in the special session.Significantly at a time when both Houses of Parliament are routinely adjourned or unable to transact any business on account of disruptions. The bill has a provision for compensating the hours lost due to disruptions by adding it to the number of hours that the Houses must sit to make up for the disruptions. Gujral's Bill is silent on the need to deprive the MP's of their allowances on the days that the house is adjourned due to disruptions.",politics,1971,55,70

Now that his upcoming films Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Padman bear a social message, he?s being called the star that takes up causes. Kumar, however, isn?t happy with either of the tags. ?I am doing different kinds of characters and they are not chosen on the basis of a particular message to give in a film.

Pak hikes defence budget by 7% amid tensions with India,"Nawaz Sharif led Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government on Friday presented its fifth budget before the 2018 general elections alloting a total of Rs 4,757 billion expenditure for the next fiscal year. Stating that Pakistan's economy has grown to over USD 300 billion, finance minister Ishaq Dar presented the annual budget at the National Assembly, hiking the expenditure on defence by 7 per cent.Sharif-led government has allocated Rs 60 billion more to defence than what it allocated in the year 2016-17.""We have increased the defence budget to Pakistani Rs 920 billion (from Pakistani Rs 860 billion),"" Dar saidIn addition to that, Dar also announced a 10 per cent hike in the salaries of soldiers who contributed in defeating militants in Operation Zarb-e-Azb, launched in 2014. This is not the first time, that Pakistan's defence budget has been so high; in 2015-16 the budget was Rs 775.8 billion and Rs 860 billion in in 2016-17. According to financial experts, the increase in thedefence budget comes in the light of cross border tensions with India, Afghanistan and Iran.Experts also say that though Pakistan Army has been rooting out terrorism from its own soil, through military operations Zarb-e-Azb, Khyber-I, Khyber-II and now Rad-ul-Fasad, tensions between India and Pakistan have only increased. India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants, who infiltrate from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into the Valley and target Indian security forces. One such attack in September last year killed 18 Indian soldiers and India retaliated with ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist launchpads in PoK. Most recently, the Pakistan Army sentenced Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on charges of espionage after a secret trial. India had demanded consular access to Jadhav, which Pakistan repeatedly denied, claiming the man was an Indian spy. India and Pakistan are also at loggerheads over a China- backed economic corridor that runs through PoK. China says it is a developmental project and will aid Pakistan's economy.

Jat community to vote against BJP in polls: Report,"As political temperature soars in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly Polls, the Jat bodies in Haryana and western UP have decided to resume their agitation for reservation from January 29. The Jat leaders blaming the respective governments for not fulfiling their demands have said they would vote against the BJP in the polls. They have also blamed the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana for not fulfiling what it had promised during the agitation in February 2016.Several districts in western UP like Saharanpur, Shamli, Mujjafarnagar, Bullandshahar, Meerut, Bagpat etc, have a large population of Jats and polarisation of these votes will be crucial for the election results. Polling in these districts is scheduled in first and second phase.BJP is already feeling the heat over demonetisation and if Jat community would go against the party, it will badly hit political equations for BJP. Hindu Jats and Muslims have significant numbers in these districts and they have the capability to turn election results in favour of particular party. SP, BSP and especially Ajit Singh's RLD are keeping close watch over the development in Haryana.

But I don?t care, because people like to perceive things in their own way.? Tiger recently faced flak for calling his female co-stars ?padding?, but he later clarified that the word was used for anything outside his own zone in a film project, and that he wasn?t referring to the female leads specifically.Given how protective he is, we ask why Tiger didn?t fire at those who trolled Krishna for posting her ?topless? photos on Instagram ? the photos, in fact, only showed her bare back ? even though his father, actor Jackie Shroff, was vocal about the matter. #Repost @divina_rikhye_photography with @repostapp. ???

"I might take Ashwin's advice and hit him on head, says Starc","The ongoing four-Test series between India and Australia has been acrimonious with players from both sides trading verbal blows but Australian pacer Mitchell Starc's latest comments could send relations between the two teams spiralling down further.

But the left-arm pacer, far from the maddening action in India, did not want to miss out on the banter and sledging that has dominated the series and took a nasty dig at star India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, promising to hit him on the head when he next visited Australia. (Inability to bowl us out will be hurting India, says Steven Smith)""I look forward to bowling to Ashwin in Australia. (I might) take his advice and hit him on the badge,"" Starc was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. (Steve Smith says Peter Handscomb, Shaun Marsh repaid his faith)Starc's insensitive comments come on the back of a cheeky response by Ashwin, who had rubbed his forehead with a forefinger after dismissing the Aussie all-rounder during the visitors' failed run-chase at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. (Virat Kohli alleges Australia of disrespecting team physio Patrick Farhart)As Australia stuttered and stumbled in their 188-run chase on a tricky Bengaluru pitch in the second Test, Ashwin, who had rocked the visitors with three wickets before tea, snuffed out the dangerous Starc.

(Sunil Gavaskar says Virat Kohli missed a trick in Ranchi)For those of you wondering why Ashwin did that, here's a recap of what happened in India's second innings. Starc was bowling a fiery spell on Sunday and Abhinav Mukund was in the firing line. As it happened, a top-edge off his bat flew over his head for a six. It was then that Starc rubbed his forehead with his index finger.Ashwin was clearly standing up for a teammate and added insult to Starc's injury after a crucial blow. While India's players have been matured enough to leave the onfield rivalry behind, Starc's latest comments could pave the way for another controversy. In 2014, Australian batsman Phil Hughes was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Ever since, there have been serious concerns after batsmen have copped blows on their headgear. Starc, in retrospection, might be embarrassed with his words. Australia, the pioneers of mental disintegration, have been clearly rattled by India's onslaught over the last two decades. In 2014, the likes of David Warner and Steve Smith were involved in some heated moments with Indian cricketers before Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma responded in kind.",general,2881,60,70

Those who talked about DNA have joined NDA: Akhilesh Yadav,"Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday mocked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar switching alligience to the BJP, reminding the JD (U) leader about a war of words over his DNA with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Yadav?s taunt came a few days after Kumar dumped his allies, RJD and Congress, to renew his old friendship with the BJP and formed a new JD(U)-led NDA government.?DNA ki baat karne waale aaj NDA mein chale gaye (the one who spoke about DNA, has joined the NDA),? Yadav told ANI in Lucknow.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister was apparently referring to Modi questioning Kumar?s DNA in an 2015 attack on the JD(U) leader?s frequent change of political allegiences. Modi?s barb came soon after Kumar led the so-called grand alliance to victory over the BJP in the Bihar assembly polls.Though Modi later said he was referring to ?DNA of democracy?, an angry Kumar had said the comment was an insult to the state and ?also gives credence to the feeling that perhaps you and your party hold a prejudice against the people of Bihar?.Earlier on Thursday, Yadav had referred to a popular Bollywood song to take on Nitish.?Na-na karte pyar tumhi se kar baithe, karna tha inkar magar ikrar tumhi se kar baithe.

Raj Gujjar body demands separate 5% quota under OBC: Report,"The Gujjars demand for reservation in Rajasthan can fast become an albatross around Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's neck. After the Rajasthan High Court struck down the move to bring five castes, including Gujjars, under the Special Backward Castes (SBC) category, the Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti has begun to demand that a separate reservation of 5 per cent be created for the nomadic castes within the Other Backward Classes (OBC), thus abiding with the total cap of 50 per cent on reservation. This, the agitating Gujjars feel, can help avoid the court's scrutiny.The Rajasthan government had, through a Bill in September, 2015, provided 5 per cent reservation for 5 castes under the Special Backward Classes (SBC), thus taking the total reservation in Rajasthan to 54 per cent. These castes include Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadia Lohars, Gadarias and Raikas.RAJASTHAN GOVERNMENT IN DILEMMA OVER DEMANDThe Rajasthan government is presently in a dilemma about whether it must accept the demand. If it yields, it runs the risk of antagonising other castes whose share in the reservation quota will then drop. Such castes include the Jats and Bishnois, among many others.Currently, according to the Supreme Court, the cap on reservation under different categories in government jobs is 50 per cent. Before the government decided to bring in a Bill for 5 per cent reservation in September last year, caste-based reservation in government jobs in Rajasthan stood at 49 per cent. That included 21 per cent for OBCs, 16 per cent for Scheduled Castes and 12 per cent for Scheduled Tribes.Also read | Raj Govt tries to assure Gujjars on quota after stir threatThe High Court had mentioned that five castes (Gujjars, Banjaras, Gadarias, Raikas and Gadia Lohars), previously falling in the category of OBCs and getting benefits of reservation, have been brought under SBCs to provide five per cent reservation, exceeding the ceiling of 50 per cent. The court observed that the SBC Commission and the state government had failed to discharge their obligation, as per the directions of the apex court, to collect quantifiable data. The court, citing the Supreme Court's 9-judge bench Indira Sahani judgement, stated that there were no special reasons for creating a separate 5 per cent reservation pool for these castes. The court mentioned that according to a report, there were 25 more backward castes.GUJJARS FEEL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT KEPT PROMISEThe representative Gujjars, who have witnessed several violent agitations in the past, feel that the government has so far not fulfilled its promise of ensuring Amendment to the 9th Schedule to bring in the requisite changes. In May 2015, members of the Gujjar community began agitating in Bharatpur by once again blocking railway tracks. After that, representatives of the Sangharsh Samiti were called in for a dialogue. As per Himmat Singh Gujjar, spokesperson for Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (RGASS), the government during the dialogue that happened following the May agitation had promised that changes would be made in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution at the Central level, thus fulfilling the government's promise on the issue of reservation.

"85,000 registered Delhi traders yet to shift to GST regime","It?s been over a fortnight since the goods and services tax regime kicked in. But about 85,000 registered traders in the Capital are still to migrate to the new regime, sources in Delhi government?s trade and taxes department said .According to a government estimate, about 4.15 lakh traders were registered with the tax department under the previous value-added tax (VAT) regime. Around 3.3 lakh traders are said to have migrated to GST till last week. Sources in the department said while many traders have not been able to migrate due to ?mismatch? in the permanent account number (PAN) provided by the traders, others have still not turned up for registration.?Any registered trader continuing with business without completing the formalities will technically be illegal,? a senior tax department official said. H Rajesh Prasad, commissioner, trade and taxes department, however, said while the number of traders who have not been able to migrate due to the PAN mismatch is not much. ?The number of such traders would not be more than a few thousand. One major reason for the PAN mismatch is change in proprietorship over generations or partnership firms changing hands. The old registration must have details of the older proprietor,? said Prasad, who has been closely associated in the GST implementation.?However, such traders are being advised to apply afresh and get a new application reference number and continue with trade,? Prasad said.Officials said while the department is making efforts to ensure all eligible traders are enrolled under the GST, the number of overall registered traders is likely to be corrected due to several reasons. ?Many of registered traders might have stopped business altogether. There is also a possibility other few accounts are either dormant or are no more eligible for the registration owning to the annual turnover cap,? an official said.All traders with an annual turnover of R 20 lakh have to register with the trade and taxes department. In order to assist the traders in GST implementation, the Delhi government has decided to run six ?GST help vans? in commercial areas to address traders? problems arising out of the new tax regime. The government has also decided to set up help desks in smaller markets. The decision was taken after deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the finance portfolio, held a meeting with senior officers of the trade and taxes department on the implementation of the GST last week. The government has already put in place GST facilitation centres.",general,2539,58,70
Drip irrigation mandatory for sugarcane crop in Maharashtra,"In a bid to tackle the ongoing agrarian discontent, the state cabinet took major decisions on Tuesday, including giving its nod to proposals minimising the cost of production, raising productivity and ensuring fair procurement prices for agriculture produce. The cabinet cleared a decision to make drip irrigation mandatory for the water-guzzling sugarcane crop after 2019 and promote group farming by offering a subsidy to participating farmers. Maharashtra is the largest sugar producing state in the country, with farmers relying on this cash crop to bring in assured dividends. Drip irrigation is expected to increase production of sugarcane even as it conserves water. The state government has chalked a scheme with the investment of Rs200 crore to promote group farming. The government will extend the subsidy of Rs1 crore each to the farmer producer company formed under Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, by at least 20 farmers with the cluster of a minimum land of 100 acres. The government has kept the target of funding about 200 such companies. The state cabinet in its decision taken on Tuesday also decided to promote animal husbandry, fisheries and sericulture to make the group farming viable. The state government has made a budgetary allocation of Rs45 crore for immediate release of the funds for the companies.?By encouraging the group farming we are aiming to maximise the use of mechanisation by providing them ample funding for modern machinery and equipment. This will help them maximise productivity and reduce the cost of production. Once productivity is increased, the farmers can get a higher rate for their produce. We will also help the companies set up food processing units, enable them to export the products and set up mechanism for effective marketing,? said agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar.The decision was taken in the backdrop of the decline in the land holding per household to 1.44 hectares in 2010-11 from 4.28 hectares in 1970-71. The state government has announced it will make it compulsory to shift the sugarcane on drip irrigation after 2019 by launching an interest subvention scheme. The government aims to bring 3.05 lakh hectare sugarcane crop under drip irrigation in next two years in addition to the current cover of 2.25 lakh hectares. Maharashtra farmers grow sugarcane crop on 9.42 lakh hectares across the state. The government will assist the conversion with the loan of Rs 85,400 a hectare at the interest of 2% to be borne by the farmers. The remaining part of the interest rate (7.25%) will be borne by state government (4%) and sugar factories (1.25%) for the loan with the tenure of 5 years. The total estimated loan to be disbursed in two years for the scheme is Rs 2,604 crore.The state government had made it compulsory in June 2015 for sugar factories in the catchment areas of eight dams (including Tembhu, Mujla, Bhima, Kanholi Nala) to switch to drip irrigation from flood irrigation till June 2019. Based on the success of the directives, the government has decided to make it mandatory for all the sugar factories to implement the drip irrigation for sugarcane crop after June 2019.?It will be the responsibility of the sugar factories to switch to the drip irrigation. The interest subvention scheme not only enable the farmers to swtich to drip will also help them in raising production per hectare,? Fundkar said.The minister said the new scheme will replace the existing subsidy scheme which cost government about Rs350 crore a year.",general,3527,59,70
Women wear American flag-hijabs at anti-Trump march,"The Women's March that followed President Donald Trump's inauguration day, caused a huge furore in its remarkable attempt to herald an end to the beginning of a new era of dictatorship.When women all across the globe and their supporters took to the streets to stand in solidarity against Trump's fascist regime, they garnered empathy indeed but was not bereft of controversy.Some have been sceptical if the march would be an end in itself. Some wonder if this march would rightly pave way to address not just white woman's feminism but the over-all issue of equality and human rights.We cannot certify what this would lead to but, at least, one cannot deny that such a mass uprising is commendable in its very approach of flagging issues that might impact civilisation in general.Among those numerous posters and placards that made news, what caught one's eye are women wearing colourful hijabs.

People drinking on Goa beaches could be arrested: Minister,"The BJP-led Goa government on Tuesday told the state legislative assembly that strict action would be taken against the people found drinking on the state beaches, and if need be, they could even be arrested.?The beaches should be clean and there should not be any illegality on them. We have also stopped people drinking on the beaches. We will not mind arresting them, if required,? state tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar told the House.The minister said police had in the past booked a few cases against tourists caught drinking on beaches.?We will be amending the Tourist Trade Act, giving more powers... I have asked the tourist guards to be on the vigil against the sale of drugs. No one will be allowed to take law into their hands,? he said.Ajgaonkar was responding to a question tabled by Congress legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.In May this year, police in the tourist state had asked its personnel to arrest people found drinking in public places. At a meeting held in Calangute that month, citizens had complained about drinking on beaches as well other public places and no action being taken against them.Meanwhile, replying to another question, the state on Tuesday refused to withdraw the contract signed with the lifeguard agency to man the beaches, claiming that the government could not run such services.?The state government used to run lifeguard services in the past. But since the government could not run it in a satisfactory manner, it was outsourced to a private firm,? chief minister Manohar Parrikar said.Responding to the demand made by the opposition benches, the Chief Minister ruled out that the government end the services of the private agency.Ajgaonkar hailed Drishti Lifesaving Private Ltd for doing ?excellent? job of saving the lives on the beaches.?So many lives have been saved by the lifeguards, who are attached to this agency. We need to save lives of people so that tourism thrives,? Ajgaonkar said.He said that total 3,033 lives were saved during the last five years by the agency, which has 677 lifeguards on its roll of which 83 per cent are Goans.Drishti is a Mumbai-based firm. The opposition legislators, including Jeniffer Monserratte and Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, demanded that since there were majority Goans working as a lifeguard, the services should be given to any state-level company.?If Goans are available to take over this contract, then they can come ahead.

"UP suffers ?5,000-crore loss post liquor ban along highways","By Abhinav Pandey Lucknow, Jul 5 (PTI) The Uttar Pradesh government has incurred a loss of about Rs 5,000 crore following the Supreme Court order banning all liquor shops along national as well as state highways. Of the 8,591 highway liquor shops affected by the Supreme Court order, 2,000 are yet to be relocated while 3,000 shop owners have surrendered their liquor licences, said UP Excise Minister Jai Pratap Singh. ""We have incurred a loss of about Rs 5,000 crore in 2016-17 fiscal ending March 31. Out of the target of realising Rs 19,000 crore, the excise department could generate Rs 14,000 crore following the apex court order order,"" the minister told PTI. The Supreme Court had last year ordered a ban on all liquor shops along national as well as state highways across the country and prohibited all signages indicating presence of liquor vends. The Supreme Court again on March 31 reiterated its December 15, 2016 order to shut down, by April 1, establishments selling and serving liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways, but relaxed the distance to 220 m for cities, towns and municipal areas with a population of 20,000 or less. According to latest data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), accidents due to drunk driving have the highest fatality rate among all accidents. NCRB data showed that some 42 per cent of drunk driving victims ended up dead in 2015 ? this was a far higher rate than that of accidents caused by over speeding and reckless driving. Highlighting his departments initiatives for going cashless, Singh said, ""We are introducing a cashless system in liquor shops and asking them to install point-of-sale (POS) machines. Though it will difficult in rural areas, we are asking shops to switch over to cashless payments."" On media reports suggesting that the cashless system is being introduced to deter teenagers from purchasing liquor, the minister said there is already a law which does not allow sale of liquor to minors. About sale of liquor near religious places and schools, he said, ""An SC order in 2008 says no to liquor vending with a radius of 75 metre of a school or religious place. But, with increase in population density, the number of schools and hospitals have increased leading to conflicts."" ""We have decided that no liquor shop will be relocated within 500 metre of religious places or hospitals. In case of objection, even residential colonies will come under the ambit. At the moment it is not in a very formal shape. But we are working on it,"" the minister said. About excise revenue expectations for 2017-18, the minister said his department has fixed a target of Rs 20,000 crore. The minister said that Yogi Adityanath government will introduce its new excise policy from April 2018 and the government plans to break the syndicate system in liquor trade. ""We are working on the new excise policy before finalising it,"" he said. The new excise policy may introduce a system of bar code on each bottle in a bid to check black marketing and pilferage in liquor sale, mostly in country-made alcohol products.",general,3098,59,70

"Withdraw, get captured or killed: Ex-China diplomat to India","A former Chinese diplomat, who was earlier Consul General in Mumbai, told Chinese state media on Wednesday that Indian troops faced three options at Doklam as the stand-off entered one month: withdrawal, capture or an attack by China ""should the dispute escalate"".His comments underline the sharpening rhetoric from Beijing - and the threat of use of force - over the stand-off, with the Chinese government still insisting that there was no room for diplomatic solutions until India fulfilled a ""precondition"" of withdrawing unilaterally.Liu Youfa, former Chinese Consul General in Mumbai and now a strategic affairs expert, told state broadcaster China Central Television's English-language channel on Wednesday, ""When people in uniform get across the border and move into territory of another country, they naturally become the enemies who have to face three consequences.""CHINA WAITING FOR INDIA TO MAKE SENSIBLE CHOICE ""First,"" Liu continued, ""They can pull out voluntarily. Or, they can be captured. And should the border dispute escalate, they maybe killed. These are the three possibilities.""Liu added, ""The Chinese side is standing there waiting for India to make a sensible choice which is the first scenario."" ""It is the best result for both sides to avoid a confrontation,"" Liu said.His comments reflect the hard-line approach to the stand-off that China has assumed, in what some experts have seen as muscle-flexing and posturing aimed at getting India to withdraw.MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN TIBET The PLA's official newspaper, the PLA Daily, reported this week in the latest indication of muscle-flexing that it had transported military equipment to Tibet under an exercise held on the plateau, although the location in northern Tibet near the Kunlun mountains is far from the site of the stand-off near the Sikkim section.In fact, the site of the stand-off at the India-China-Bhutan tri-junction is thought to be one of the few pockets along the border where China is at a considerable disadvantage in terms of both terrain and its capability to sustain a long-term forward posture, which some experts say might partly explain its shrill rhetoric.Also read: Doklam standoff: China says no bilateral talks with India till impasse is resolved",general,2249,60,70

Crime rises in Delhi with a rape case reported every 4 hours,"Crime in Delhi increased for the third straight year and three out of every four cases registered in 2016 went unsolved, official data released on Monday showed.The numbers, released by Delhi Police as part of an annual disclosure, cement the national capital?s reputation of being a dangerous city ? particularly for women who made a distress-call to helplines every 9 minutes on an average.Of the 2,09,519 cases reported last year, 1,53,562 cases ? or 73.29% of them ? could not be cracked. In 2015, the proportion of cases that were unsolved was 72.78%.Allegations of crimes against women ? a molestation complaint every two hours, a rape case every four hours ? remained staggeringly high. But rape cases were fewer in 2016 compared to the year before when 2,199 cases were registered. Last year, 2,155 rape cases were filed.?In the last three-four years, the proactive action by the police has led to a positive demonstration effect. Each complaint given by a woman is being immediately registered and seriously investigated. This is the reason why the numbers appear constant,? joint commissioner of police, Dependra Pathak said.Most of the cases that remained unsolved were street crimes ? robberies, snatching, pick-pocketing and similar thefts. These incidents are more widespread, affecting most citizens.Every six minutes, someone becomes a victim of theft. There was a case of snatching reported every 30 minutes on an average.?It is very important for the police to instil faith in people by working hard to solve such cases. More than solving of these cases, it is important how police develops relationship with the person who has lodged the case. How they behave with the complainant make a lot of difference,? criminal psychologist Rajat Mitra said. Former Delhi police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma explained that less heinous crimes are often neglected by police teams. ?Firstly, there are no eyewitnesses in such cases and hence the investigation is very time consuming. The only way to solve them is to study the crime scene in detail and gather clues.?Police, Sharma added, gave precedence to law and order duties over solving street crime cases. ?There is already shortage of staff and investigators, on top of that police personnel are engaged in security and law and order duties.

Tonic water firm Founder earns ?602 crore on selling shares,"Fever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in £73m of shares.The sale left the company?s stock down 2% at £17.12 on Thursday ? but that is still nearly 13 times its £1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth £222m, and the company is valued at nearly £2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino?s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just £100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005.From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling £25m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014. Rolls has cashed out to the tune of £100m, because he also sold a £12m tranche of shares last year.He owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water ? or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company?s name, with saving his life.Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet.Indeed, one of the company?s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran Adrià, who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world?s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011.Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US. And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to £34.3m on sales of £102m.This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market.Rolls had noticed that the world?s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. ?There?s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn?t right,? he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion?s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra £73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day.",business,4040,59,70

But in the last 40 years, not a single bullet has been fired because of border dispute,"" Modi said during a panel discussion at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. He shared the stage with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Austria and Moldova.Modi was responding to a question whether India's opposition to China's One Belt One Road project reflects deep discord in their relationship. India had boycotted a high-profile conference recently hosted by China on the project, citing ""sovereignty"" issue since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The prime minister noted that it is not the same bipolar world of before when nations were aligned either with the United States or the former Soviet Union.""It is an inter-connected and inter-dependent world. So countries may have some disputes and some areas of collaboration,"" he said, noting that India and Russia relationship has stood the test of time as it was based on trust.The 24-page St Petersburg Declaration, released yesterday after his summit with Putin, is a testament to India-Russia relation, Modi said. ""And I know the world will minutely scrutinize every word for future direction of our relations.""On China, he said that despite differences, New Delhi and Beijing have come together on the BRICS platform to create two financial institutions, one headed by China where India is a partner and one BRICS Bank where the two regional superpowers are collaborators.",general,1764,52,70

Casting in films based on famous family or big name: Prachi,"Actor Prachi Desai, who bid goodbye to her TV career in 2009 after doing the popular show Kasamh Se, is miffed with the kind of content Indian television has today.

Citibank launches voice verification for phone banking,"New Delhi, Jan 10 (PTI)Foreign lender Citi India today launched voice biometrics authentication that would replace the current practice of interactive voice response (IVR) for its customers. The new technology allows clients to use their voiceprints for authentication rather than having to remember multiple PINs or respond to questions used for verifying their identities, Citi South Asia Head (Operations & Technology) Anand Chopra said. The voice biometrics authentication capability uses voiceprint, similar to fingerprint, which is unique for each person. The new authentication solution is fast, secure and convenient as verification is completed automatically within 15 seconds while clients speak to the (bank) official when they call CitiPhone Banking, the 24-hour hotline service. Earlier, on an average, it took 45 seconds for a customer to verify his/her details. ""This technology will definitely add to customer convenience by saving around 30 seconds/per call, on verifying their identity. This will create opportunities for our Citiphone banking officers to engage with our customers in a holistic manner and provide more value-added services to them,"" he said. On an average, CitiPhone in India receives 12.5 million calls annually. When clients call CitiPhone Banking, they can choose to enroll for this service by having their voice recorded to generate their unique voiceprint. Each voiceprint will be uniquely tagged and cannot be emulated or reused once stored. ""Voice biometrics authentication coupled with our already launched e-chat and virtual assistant feature, will transform the way we service the Citi customers in India. We anticipate a very high uptake for the use of voice biometrics authentication amongst our customers,"" Chopra said. Clients can enroll for the voice biometrics authentication by calling CitiPhone Banking. Upon clients agreement, a recording will be made of their voice while speaking with a CitiPhone officer.",general,1963,54,70

Yeh aurat thodi hi hain.""Kiran told the publication, ""They had an internal discussion for an hour after the screening. First, they told us that they were giving us an A certificate. Then they told us that there are 48 cuts. We argued that if the film is for adults, then why have so many cuts. They didn't bother much, and continued to explain each cut and their logic behind it.""She added, ""In the middle of that, a lady officer turned to me and said, 'Aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakti hain'. And before I could speak up, a man in the committee said, 'But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing.' I was dumbfounded. This is such a regressive thought... Sadly, this is the kind of humiliation producers have to put up with. If they are judging me by my clothes, I can imagine the parameters they must have used to pass my film.""Babumoshai Bandookbaaz has been directed to do away with abusive words as well as 80 per cent of its ""humping"" scenes. Director Kushan Nandy was appalled and told the daily, ""First and foremost, we don't have humping scenes. They are love-making scenes. I am shocked and appalled with what has happened. If you notice the cuts, there's a sentence, 'Yeh kaahe ka c******a hai'. We use such sentences in our everyday life. The excuse given to us is that children also sneak into cinema halls to watch adult films. How is that my problem? Penalise the cinema halls for this, not the producers. The way they have dealt with our film is insulting. They humiliated Kiran which is unpardonable.""Apparently, the filmmaker has been asked to get rid of a bunch of sentences with the word ""khada"" in it. He met Pahlaj Nihalani in private to discuss the directives, but the CBFC chief had a shocking response - ""You are lucky I'm not banning your film.""Kushan said, ""When I argued that there are no grounds to do that, he retorted, 'What are these abuses? Do you plan to make a dictionary of bad words?' He even asked me to change lines like 'Maa ka lehenga' to 'Maa ka anchal'. In short, the essence of what is being said is lost. He told me, 'C*****a ko tutiya kar do.' He is basically trying to teach us to make a film. And finally, he told me to remove the line that has 'Khada' in it. He said, 'I will never let it pass because I am abused for my song Khada Hai Khada Hai to this day.' I'll fight this till the end.""Pahlaj Nihalani refused to comment on the matter.At a media interaction today, Kiran Shroff shared all that the CBFC members told her. One CBFC board member asked Kiran Shroff(producer) 'Why as a woman have you made this film?: Kushan Nandy,director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazThen another CBFC board member said 'ye to pant shirt pehne huye hain woman thodi hain': Kushan Nandy,director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazThey(CBFC) told us that we have given 48 cuts in the film: Kiran Shroff,Producer #BabumoshaiBandookbaazpic.twitter.com/NbFBDWZHSpThen Pahlaj Nihalani came and told me that I am lucky that my film is not banned: Kushan Nandy,Director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazpic.twitter.com/RHBxREjM4f",general,3834,60,70
Phogat sisters to campaign for BJP in Delhi civic polls,"After sweeping the civic polls in Maharashtra and almost snatching Mumbai from the Shiv Sena, the BJP has now set its sights on the Delhi municipal corporation. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls are scheduled to take place on April 22, and the BJP, which has been ruling the MCD for over a decade, has planned an aggressive campaign to take on its rivals.Besides the Congress, the BJP will also face challenge from Arvind Kejriwal's the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is contesting the MCD polls for the first time. A total of 272 seats in North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporation are up for grabs in the election. BJP's CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR MCD POLLSLast week, BJP President Amit Shah appointed a team of five senior leaders to oversee and supervise the poll campaign. The team includes Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Jitendra Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Sanjeev Balyan and Shyam Jaju. ""We are going all out for the MCD polls and have set a very high target for ourselves. Our triumphs in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have given a fresh impetus to our workers and volunteers and to add to that strength, we are bringing in big faces as well,"" a BJP source said.Prominent among the big faces are Amit Shah and Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu who are likely to address a convention of polling booth in-charges at the Ramlila Maidan on March 25. BJP's Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari was quoted by a Hindustan Times report as saying that he will invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a rally in the national capital.The party has also roped in Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishen to woo the Poorvanchalis (Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh), who form a bulk of voters in Delhi.The Phogat sisters, Geeta and Babita, too will campaign for the BJP in the run up to the MCD polls, while talks with cricketer Shikhar Dhawan are yet to be finalised. BEYOND STAR CAMPAIGNS, WHAT IS BJP PLANNINGThe BJP's rule at the MCD has been tarred by allegations of nepotism and rampant corruption by its councillors. To project a fresh, corruption-free face ahead of the MCD polls, Manoj Tiwari recently announced that the party will not field a single sitting councillor or his/her relative for the upcoming election.The decision took senior BJP councillors in Delhi by surprise but was believed to have the approval of the party's highest leadership. ""Zero-tolerance towards corruption, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's style of functioning, has to be our mantra in all party matters, including distribution of tickets,"" Manoj Tiwari said, while brushing off talks of discontentment in the party. ""We are not bothered about the feelings of sitting councillors. We are answerable only to the public, not to the councillors,"" he said.Such sweeping decision in the BJP before the MCD polls comes in the wake of both the Congress and the AAP targeting the BJP-run MCD for corruption. AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly attacked the MCD for having failed to implement Narendra Modi's flagship cleanliness drive on the ground. He called the MCD ""a den of corruption"" which doesn't even ""issue a death certificate without a bribe.""ALSO READ:",general,3155,55,70
Bombay High Court to appoint committee to review Jolly LLB 2,"The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has ordered a three-member committee to review the Akshay Kumar-starrer Jolly LLB 2 on Wednesday. The court also asked the committee to find out whether the allegations levelled by petitioner Ajaykumar Waghmare are true.Waghmare is a practising lawyer from Nanded, who had said that the film is ""nothing but an attempt to portray the Indian Legal Profession and Judicial System as a laughing stock to the society at large."" ALSO READ: Katrina Kaif seems to have fractured her hand, but...ALSO READ: 5 best moments from Shah Rukh Khan's hilarious podcast with AIBWaghmare said that the characters in Jolly LLB 2 are playing cards and dancing in the premises of the Court of Law which clearly shows disrespect towards judicial discipline, proceedings and ethics. The characters jumping on the judge's dais and fighting in court shows mockery of the court.Waghmare had formed his opinion after watching the trailers. He also attached a copy of the trailer in his petition as well. However, senior lawyer P M Shah appearing for the filmmaker has quashed the baseless allegations and said that the complete picture of the film cannot be formed on the basis of trailers. The bench, consisting of justices VM Kanade and Sangitrao Patil said, ""We have seen the photographs; one of which shows a lawyer jumping on the dais and arguing with the judge. The second photograph shows the judge hiding below the dais and passing some orders by banging the gavel on the table."" With this, the court felt that ""prima facie, though the above referred photographs do indicate total disrespect or disregard to the high office of this court, we cannot jump to that conclusion unless the contexts in which these scenes are shown, are examined in their proper perspective"".Thus, the court felt that it is necessary to appoint a committee as amicus curiae to watch the film and submit a report.",general,1918,60,70
"Was 13, didn't have moustache: Tejashwi on corruption charge","A day after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar stopped short of asking him to step down in the wake of corruption charges, deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav ruled out possibility of quitting. Tejashwi, who attended the Cabinet meeting called by Nitish alongwith elder brother Tej Pratap, described corruption charges levelled against him as a conspiracy hatched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""I was just 13 or 14 when the sale of railway hotels took place.

From Day 1 they have been trying to break our alliance but Mahagathbandhan is will not break and BJP will get a befitting reply,"" Tejashwi, who has been named by the CBI in a land-for-hotel case, said.""First, they feared my father (Lalu) and now they are nervous of me also and therefore they are targeting me,"" a defiant Tejashwi said. He went on to play the caste card asserting that since he came from backward caste, the BJP was targeting him. ""People of Bihar elected me.

"OnePlus 5 to launch in June with dual camera, 8 GB RAM","The OnePlus 5 is one of the most hotly anticipated handsets of the year, arguably even more than the iPhone 8. If the rumours and leaks are to be believed, then the phone may launch on June 15 itself. The smartphone will succeed One Plus 3T, which was arguably one of the best phones to launch last year. With such a glorious past, it is natural to have high hopes and expectations with the upcoming OnePlus 5. Update: Earlier we heard that the OnePlus 5 will launch on June 15. Well, at least that was the information that was leaked. Now it seems there is a new date. This latest rumour hints that the OnePlus 5 will be launched on June 20. The latest information comes courtesy leak from China where a screenshot of a image with June 20 circled has been leaked. Well, whether it is June 20 or June 15, it seems that the OnePlus 5 is just weeks away. The phone has been subjected to several leaks and rumours lately. A lot has been heard, written and spoken about the device. While the company has already confirmed few specs of the phone, a roundup of all the rumours and leaks of the phone will help you get a clearer idea of what the smartphone could bring to the table.OnePlus 5 is expected to sport a 5.5-inch display with thin bezels. Also, the phone could bear A5000 model number. While there is no word on the resolution yet but the phone could come with either 1440P or 1080P, similar to what we see in OnePlus 3T.OnePlus 5 could share its looks with OnePlus 3T. The phone may flaunt a metal unibody design with aluminium built metal frames and rounded edges. OnePlus 5 is expected to be slimmer and compact than the OnePlus 3T. Look into the shadows. What do you 5ee? pic.twitter.com/QPQq9feIMeRecently, one of company's key officials also dismissed the rumours of OnePlus ditching the 3.5mm headphone and confirmed that the flagship phone will come with the 3.5mm headphone jack and a front-placed fingerprint sensor. The volume and power button placed on the right side, similar to the OnePlus 3T. OnePlus 5 is expected to sport bigger battery than the previously announced OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. There are rumours that the smartphone could come with 4000mAh battery and support for Quick Charge 4.0. It is also almost confirmed that OnePlus 5 will come with Oxygen OS based on Android Nougat. The smartphone could come be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835 processor with Adreno 540 GPU. Rumours suggest that the smartphone could come in two storage variants- with 6G RAM and 64GB ROM and the second one with 8GB of RAM with 128GB internal storage. This is going to be the USP of OnePlus 5. The phone is expected to come with a major upgrade over its predecessor in terms of photography. India Today Tech, in its previous report, had confirmed of dual rear-camera set up which will put the phone in competition against the likes of iPhone 7 and Xiaomi Mi 6. While previous rumours hinted of only dual camera set up at the back, a recent teasers released by company starring Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput suggests that the device might also come with dual cameras at the front. Expect a 16 MP camera, both at the front and back. The company last month entered into partnership with DxO to better the photography experience of OnePlus 5. DxO is a company best known for developing the photography benchmark test called DxOMark. OnePlus 5 could come in funky colour options like Yellow, Red, Turquoise with hint of pink and green, Gold and Black. OnePlus 5 could be priced higher than its predecessor. Reason being the dual camera set up and latest processor but that does not mean that the phone could cost Rs 60,000 or above like the iPhone.",technology,3674,54,70
"Cheesemaker offers ?42,000 reward to recover stolen cheese","A Somerset cheesemaker has offered a £500 reward after two of its finest vintage cheddars were stolen during a prestigious show. The judges at the Yeovil show had crowned the two hefty blocks of cheese champion and reserve champion and the specimens were being left in a marquee overnight so that they could be admired by members of the public next day. Thieves took the blocks, weighing 20kg each and with a retail value of around £800, and the winners? certificates from the tent during overnight on Saturday. The cheesemakers at Wyke Farms in Bruton, Somerset, were devastated that two of the best blocks they had ever produced have vanished. Rich Clothier, a third generation cheesemaker and the managing director of Wyke Farms, said he believed the thieves had targeted the prize-winning cheddars and may have been stealing to order. He said it was possible the cheeses were already abroad. ?They left all the other cheeses and just took ours,? he said. ?It?s disappointing. To win the champion and reserve was really nice for us. It took around a year-and-a-half to make those cheeses. They are among the best we have ever produced.? Clothier said that while the retail value was put at £800 it is possible that they could be worth much more if the right wealthy cheese-loving customers were found. Wyke Farms sells to 160 countries with the US and France big fans. He said: ?These cheeses could be considered masterpieces; it?s a bit like having a valuable painting stolen. Clothier said he was proud of the cheeses? ?rounded flavour? with tones of ?dairy, sweet and nuttiness?. ?They were complex, like a fine bottle of wine.? Clothier said it was possible the theft had been carefully planned. ?You can?t just put one of those in a bag. It?s like carrying a bag of sand away.? The cheesemaker is offering a £500 reward for information that leads to the recovery of the cheese or the arrest of the thief or thieves. Cheese thefts are not unknown to the family, however. In 1789 one of Clothier?s ancestors had a wheel of cheese stolen from his cart in Kilver Street, Shepton Mallet. This cheese, then worth seven shillings, was found in the possession of a woman who claimed it ?fell off the back of the cart?.",general,2218,58,70
People don?t see passports on buying film ticket: Pak actor,"One of Pakistan?s most prominent actors, Adnan Siddiqui who played Sridevi?s husband in Mom, says that people in his country loved the film and are ecstatic about the collaboration between two nations.He also spoke about the rapidly deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan and why artistes from both the countries need to rise above the politics.Excerpts from the interview:Mom opened to very encouraging review for you and Sajal Aly in India. How has it been received in Pakistan?A good product is well-received everywhere. People here in Pakistan have loved the film and are ecstatic about the collaboration between the two nations.Tragically, you and Sajal Ali could not be a part of the film?s promotion and release... Tell me your honest and deepest thoughts on not being able to be in Mumbai for the opening of your film?Obviously, it is a sad feeling when you are not able to promote a project you have spent tiring days and nights working on. But then you are relieved that the promotion lies in more than capable hands, for the likes of Sridevi and Nawaazuddin Siddiqui and Akshaye Khanna.Before you, Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan could not be in India for the release of their big films. How do you look at this situation where artistes from Pakistan are being left out of their moment of glory? Is there a growing sense of resentment among Pakistani artistes for this state of isolation?I wouldn?t go as far as saying there?s resentment to this situation. But I would agree it is hurting the relations between artists of both the countries. The politics may steer a situation in any direction but the people of both countries love and respect art for what it is. They don?t see passports when they purchase a ticket, they see a film.Political relations between the two countries have deteriorated to such an extent that cultural ties are also threatened now. What do you feel about the impasse between the two countries and how it can be resolved?No matter how hard people try, our cultural ties will come out strong. We share more than just the colour of our skins, we share history, we share values, we share customs and it is just a matter of time we will start sharing our artists, directors, writers, technicians on a large scale too. I honestly believe we can find peace in art.In fact, you have produced a TV series on Hindus in Pakistan and have constantly championed India-Pakistan peace. Is that hard to do when hostility seems fashionable?No, it isn?t. As I said, people of the both countries are smart enough not get themselves into politically incorrect situations. My production of Seeta Bagri was extremely well perceived and people in Pakistan supported its message of tolerance and brotherhood.How did you decide to work in Mom? And was it difficult to shoot for the film with growing political hostilities between the two countries?Once I got the offer, I couldn?t resist myself from saying yes since, I knew, I would be playing a role against Sridevi and I was also aware that Sajal Aly from Pakistan, who is a beautiful actor, is part of the cast. The political hostility as you say did create hurdles for the film. However, it was Boney Kapoor Saab who became the leader and crisis-breaker, sorted out the production issues and took us all home for a win.Adnan Siddiqui is known for his roles on TV.You are a known face and name in India, thanks to your wonderful television serials which have amply demonstrated your range. Tell us about your experience of becoming a television star before capturing cinema?My journey in the media industry started with my modeling career and it took off with a casual role in a drama serial. People were extremely kind in accepting me as an actor when I knew nothing and since then, I am trying to prove to them, my fans, that they were right about me.Does the film industry in your country offer you enough opportunities as an actor?The New Cinema, as I like to call it, is a growing baby. There are a lot of players with growing ambitions, hence, it is creating opportunities all across the board which is a beautiful sight. However, since it is an evolving industry, we will need time to eradicate the mistakes and enhance the strengths.Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,4242,59,70

Maha farmers to fast indefinitely to protest land acquisition,"Protesting against the ?forcible acquisition of farm land for the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), farm activists plan to go on an indefinite fast from August 1 in Raigad district under the banner of ?Corridor Virodhi Shetkari Sangharsh Samiti? and ?Jagatikaran Virodhi Kruti Samiti?.The group represents 78 villages, which were originally part of the project.

Bowlers second-class citizens in white-ball cricket: Bond,"""Bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,"" says former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond, who feels odds are stacked heavily against them in the limited-overs format.Writing for the International Cricket Council ahead of the upcoming Champions Trophy in England starting June 1, Bond said limited-overs cricket is ""a batsman's game"".""And it isn't merely the fast bowlers, who have their task cut out. The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit,"" he said.""...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,"" he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics.""The slow bowlers specifically are resorting to a more negative line of bowling, not because they want to but because they have to,"" he said.""In an era gone by, the pattern was to tee-off in the first 15 overs, build through the middle of the innings and then launch a final onslaught. That philosophy has now gone out the window,"" he explained.Bond said bowlers cannot do without variety in the current scenario where every alternate game ends up being a run feast.""The yorker is not just one of the most difficult balls to bowl, the margin for error is also extremely small. Therefore, it becomes vital to use that weapon judiciously.""You must have the ability to change the length? bowl the yorker, yes, but also use the bouncer, the slower ball, the length ball,"" he opined.""You dont bowl the full ball to certain batsmen, you dont bang it in to certain others. All of it is very much opposition, ground, conditions and batter-dependent. If you are off even marginally, the yorker is probably the easiest ball to hit for a four or a six. You have to weigh up risk against reward,"" he said.Bond said bowlers in modern cricket should mix it up to make it difficult for the batsman to settle down.",sports,1980,57,70
Kejriwal repeats 'take bribe' appeal despite EC notice,"A day after the Election Commission issued him a notice for allegedly promoting bribery, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday reiterated his appeal to voters to accept bribes offered by political parties but cast their ballot for his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).?If they are being offered Rs 5,000, I would tell them to ask for Rs 10,000 from Akali Dal, BJP and Congress but vote for AAP,? the party?s national convenor said in Chandigarh.Addressing the media, Kejriwal claimed that this matter has been already settled in court.?Someone had filed a case when I said the same thing before the Delhi elections but the court ruled that I?m not promoting bribery but stopping it,? he said.But the poll panel on Monday issued a notice to Kejriwal over the violation of the model code of conduct for his reported remarks in poll-bound Goa. The EC pointed out that Kejriwal said at a rally that Congress and BJP will come to distribute money. Kejriwal reportedly added people should accept it in new currency and ask for Rs 10,000 instead of Rs 5,000, keeping in mind the inflation, but that their votes should go to AAP.The commission said the AAP leader?s statement amounts to ?abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery?. ?If they are being offered Rs 5,000, I would tell them to ask for Rs 10,000 from Akali Dal, BJP and Congress but vote for AAP.?Attack on BadalsOn Tuesday, Kejriwal said once the AAP comes to power in Punjab, it would set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the corruption allegations against the Badals and recover the amount ?with interest and penalty?.He said Punjab cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majithia, who has been ?named by international drug dealers? for his involvement in spreading drugs in the state, would be arrested by April 15.?Kewal nasha nahi, logon ko inke dar se bhi mukti milegi (Not only drugs, people would be freed from his fear too),? he said.On Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh?s decision to contest against chief minister Parkash Singh Badal from Lambi constituency, Kejriwal said Amarinder was trying to help Badal so that AAP candidate Jarnail Singh doesn?t win from there.?Badal had approached Amarinder for help, and he would withdraw cases against him in return,? he said. ?He?s not contesting to defeat Badal but to help him win from there.?Asked to comment on Navjot Singh Sidhu?s joining the Congress, the AAP leader said the cricketer-turned politician was ?over? and it doesn?t matter now.",politics,2479,54,70

Rajasthan University to teach Akbar's Haldighati's defeat,"After the revision in class 10 schoolbooks, the University of Rajasthan?s (RU) history department is set to include a book that projects Rajput king Maharana Pratap as a victor in the 1576 Battle of Haldigati against Mughal emperor Akbar?s forces.Historical evidence shows that Pratap had fled the battlefield with more casualties on his side and later continued his guerrilla warfare against the Mughals. The dominant view about the battle so far has been in favour of the Mughal army.But those who dispute the dominant view, including the revised history schoolbook, say that the Mughal army?s failure in capturing or killing Maharana Pratap, its decision to not pursue Pratap?s army after he fled, and Akbar?s displeasure with his generals Man Singh and Asaf Khan prove that Pratap prevailed in the war.School education minister Vasudev Devnani had in March this year questioned Akbar?s victory asking why he attacked Mewar six times if he won the battle, and pronounced the Rajput king the victor.The history department of RU, in a meeting of its board of studies last month, decided to include Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharma?s Rashtra-Ratna Maharana Pratap in the list of recommended readings in the paper ?Rajasthan Through the Ages? in the second semester of MA History.Sharma?s book, according to the minutes of the meeting, has a fresh interpretation of Maharana Pratap, and projects him as a great freedom fighter, besides projecting him as a victor in the battle of Haldighati.The board also decided to include a topic ?Debate on the outcome of the Battle of Haldighati? in the topics to be covered under the paper. The university?s academic council subsequently approved the board?s decisions, which means students shall be studying the revised syllabus from this year onwards.The idea to teach Akbar?s ?defeat? in the university was first mooted by a BJP MLA Mohan Lal Gupta, also a member of the university?s syndicate, in a meeting of the syndicate in February this year.The MLA had suggested that a book ?Atit se Sakshatkar? by Onkar Singh Lakhawat and another one by Prof KS Gupta on the Haldighati battle be included in the syllabus.Lakhawat, however, wrote to the department that he has neither authored nor edited any book by that title. Prof Gupta too had not written any book on the topic but said he has written some research papers.After deliberations, the board felt ?there is a need to know the latest researches on Maharana Pratap and the battle of Haldighati?, and Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharma?s book was included in the syllabus.Under the BJP government in the state, several schoolbooks have been rewritten to promote its parent RSS?s saffron ideology. Hindutva ideologue Savarkar gained prominence while Nehru and Gandhi were relegated to periphery, and rival Congress was termed a ?nurtured baby? of the British, among other changes.BJP leaders have said that students were being taught ?distorted? versions of history earlier, and it was only bringing those leaders to the fore who were deliberately ignored by ?Communist? historians.",general,3059,57,70

""The canteen stores department (CSD) and the unit run canteens under it have been asked by the services to turn cashless from March 1 as they will sell goods only using plastic money,"" sources told Mail Today here.

The local formations have issued advisories to the retired personnel that they should arrange credit or debit cards by March 1 as the canteens are turning cashless, the sources said. For military personnel, its easy to turn cashless as all their personnel get their salaries in their bank accounts and have already been issued debit cards by their respective banks long time back, the sources said. The pensions of the retired soldiers and officers are also disbursed through banks and they have also been given the plastic cards.

Maha farmers demand ?1 cr per hectare for refinery project,"The proposed West Coast Refinery and Petrochemical project seems to have run into trouble, as farmers in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have asked the state government to hike the land acquisition rate to Rs1crore a hectare ? at par with the Mubmbai-Nagpur super communication highway. The project, which is estimated to cost Rs2.5 lakh crore, needs 6,018 hectares of land from around 3,000 farmers in 16 villages in two districts. The state government in May issued a notification under the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) Act, clarifying its intent to acquire land for the project. The project has been proposed by three government-controlled oil marketing companies with the stakes of the Centre and the state governments. The state has followed the acquisition formula adopted for the Jaitapur nuclear power plant in 2013. Farmers in Jaitapur have opposed the land acquisition rate: Rs 22.50 lakh a hectare. In a meeting with Ravindra Chavan, minister of ports and medical education, a delegation of farmers quoted the rate given to Mumbai-Nagpur and Mumbai-Pune expressways and raised 27 demands, including Rs1crore a hectare. ?The delegation expressed its displeasure over the rate being offered to farmers. The government paid Rs1crore a hectare in the Mumbai-Goa highway road widening project and Rs52 lakh to Rs5.2 crore a hectare for the Mumbai-Nagpur corridor. The next meeting has been convened by industries minister Subhash Desai on July 24,? said an official from MIDC.Shiv Sena alleged that the project would disturb the bio-diversity, increase pollution levels and destroy farmers? livelihood. In a climbdown of sorts, it now says that if farmers are ready to handover their land, it has no objection. ?If our 27 demands are fulfilled, we have no objection to the project,? Rajan Salvi, Shiv Sena MLA from Rajapur, told HT.?I am sure the BJP-led government at the Centre and in the state will fulfil all these demands,? said Pramod Jathar former BJP MLA from Kankavali.",general,2002,58,70
Abhinav Bindra reveals he was epileptic during Rio Olympics,"Abhinav Bindra, Beijing Olympics Gold medal winner and India's most decorated shooter, revealed he was fighting epilepsy during the Rio Games. Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Bindra said he had been suffering since the 2014 Commonwealth Games.However, despite the odds, Bindra qualified for the finals of the men's 10 metre air rifle final event in Rio last August.But Bindra, who was a bright medal prospect for India, narrowly missed out on a medal after finishing fourth in the final at the Olympic Shooting Centre.Bindra did not however use his condition as an excuse in the Rio Games.""I didn't end up fourth because my hands were shaking or because of the condition. I ended up fourth because I wasn't good enough ,"" Bindra said. Participating in his fifth Olympics, the 33-year-old got off to a good start with scores of 29.9 and 30.2 in the first two series placing him in the top three.He fell to the fourth spot after a relatively poor 21.1 in the third series with a total score of 81.2. But luck favoured Bindra in the fourth series as he climbed to second with 21.5 as the other shooters in the top four also faltered. However, Bindra seemed to let the pressure get to him as his performance started to go downhill from there. The former World Champion registered progressively poorer scores of 20.8, 20.2 in the next two series. A brilliant series of high 10s saw him go up to second after 11 shots and third after 12.Bindra had maintained the position till the 14th shot but a couple of poor shots saw him score 20.1 in what would eventually be his final series and tied at fourth with Ukranian Serhiy Kulish after the 16th shot. In the shoot-off that followed, Bindra could manage only a 10.0 while the Ukranian shot a brilliant 10.5 to move ahead, thus relegating the Indian to the fourth place.The ace Indian shooter said he had no regret after the heartbreak in Rio because he knew he had done the best he could. ""Time is the best healer. You accept what the reality is and move on. Sometimes an event happens and then you move on. I was satisfied I tried the best I could. An athlete is scared of regret but I had no regret,"" Bindra said in the session moderated by Boria Majumdar. Meanwhile, Deepa Malik, who became the first Indian to win a Paralympic Silver medal in Rio, talked about her early struggles and looked back at the time when she was given a difficult choice.Speaking at the India Today Conclave 2017, Deepa said: ""In 1999, there was a choice given to me, repetitive tumours... we can either make you live, or make you walk. Otherwise the tumour will spread to your head. My body could be paralyzed, I never chose my soul to be paralysed. In 1999, my husband was at war... hospital was full war injured soldiers... they were proud of their injuries. I asked the doctor, can I walk to the operation theater and not take the stretcher... I took those 10 steps and realised how much we are blessed to do those little things.I spoke to my husband on radio. I said ""Dear Vikram. Over. They say I will never walk again. Over.""He said, ""Don't worry about your legs. I will carry you over all my life. Let's just be alive.""Sports was more about creating a new identity for me and about declaring to the world that legs indeed are overrated.",general,3272,59,70
Call devastated his life: Mom of boy who got 'Google' offer,"Bharti Sharma, mother of the 16-year-old boy who made headlines for getting a job offer from Google and then for it being a hoax, said on Wednesday the incident had ?devastated? her son?s life. Talking to HT, Bharti, a teacher from Kurukshetra, said Harshit got a hoax call, and not a letter, informing him about his selection for the post of graphic designer. ?Harshit got a phone call. We did not believe it at first. I kept telling him it could be hoax,? said the mother. ?He shared the information with his school principal, who further released a press note, which led to media coverage.?Bharti said once the news was published and mediapersons started contacting them, they too thought the job offer is genuine.?We thought the principal has some confirmation,? she said.Where did letter come from?However, question remains over the offer letter that the school has provided to the media, claiming that Harshit had forwarded it to a teacher. The letter has several mistakes and does not contain any salary details. Bharti maintained that Harshit did not provide it to the school. Harshit had completed Class 12 from Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 33, this year. It was on Saturday that the UT administration released a press note about Harshit?s achievement. The release claimed that the internet giant would pay him Rs 12 lakh per month as salary after a year?s training. During training, it was claimed he will get a stipend of Rs 4 lakh per month.However, on Tuesday, Google denied having offered paid training and job to Harshit. Bharti said Harshit hasn?t eaten since Tuesday and is hospitalised. ?Doctors say he is traumatised. Those who were congratulating us are now taunting us,? she said.Claiming they did not want to blame the principal or any teacher, Bharti said: ?Harshit only told her about the call.??Family evading authorities?However, Beniwal maintained that Harshit forwarded a copy of the offer letter to a teacher through WhatsApp. The principal alleged Harshit?s family had been evading the authorities and there phone number were also switched off. Meanwhile, Beniwal has submitted a report to the education department after it ordered a probe on Tuesday.It is learnt the principal has stated that she was on leave and got information about the boy getting a job offer through two teachers.

Liver transplant saves life of boy with perpetual jaundice,"A 13-year-old boy Khalid Muhammad had to spend 12 - 15 hours everyday lying on his bed with blue lights over him. He had a rare condition called Crigler Najjar Syndrome, which affects 1 in a million babies. Babies with this condition are perpetually jaundiced as their liver does not produce an enzyme that is necessary to break down bilirubin, a yellowish bi-product of body?s natural processes, to an excretable form.?The light emitted during phototherapy helps the bilirubin to break down to the excretable form and does the work of the enzyme. However, as the child grows and the skin becomes thicker, they need to stay under the blue light for longer periods,? said Dr Sibbal.The normal bilirubin count is 1; Khalid?s count was 30 when he underwent a liver transplant at Indraprastha Apollo hospital to reverse the condition. ?The unconjugated bilirubin, one of the four types, can go into the brain and cause permanent damage. It can also lead to deafness,? said Dr Anupam Sibbal, group medical director of Apollo Hospitals. The only cure for the condition is liver transplant. ?Although the liver is healthy, it does not produce the particular enzyme needed to break down bilirubin. So, the only treatment is to replace tue liver with a healthier one,? said Dr Sibbal.Read More: World?s smallest baby gets liver transplantTo date, the hospital has transplanted livers in five babies to correct the rare condition. Ayanveer Singh, 3-year-old from Kapurthala, Punjab, underwent a transplant last year at the hospital. ?Now, he is active, plays a lot and is like any other baby. But, when he was born, for six months the doctors did not know why he had jaundice. All his tests were normal, he was being given phototherapy,but he did not recover even after six months. That?s when we brought him to Delhi and got a diagnosis,? said Prabhjot Singh, his father.Childhood jaundice is very common and one in 10 children get it at birth. ?But, this should resolve within 15 days with phototherapy. If it doesn?t resolve, the underlying cause has to be determined,? said Dr Sibbal.

"?50,000 fine for dumping waste in river Ganga","The National Green Tribunal (NGT) today banned the dumping of any waste within 500 metres of the Ganga. It has also declared the river's stretch between Uttarakhand's Haridwar to Uttar Pradesh's Unnao as a no-development zone.The apex green court said the government in Uttar Pradesh should be ""duty-bound"" to shift leather tanneries from Jajmau to Unnao or any other place it considers appropriate within six weeks.In its order today, the top green court also said the 100 metres distance from the edge of the river, considered holy by many Hindus, will not be used for developmental purposes.The NGT has directed the governments in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to formulate guidelines for religious activities on the ghats of Ganga or its tributaries. The NGT has further declared an environment penalty of Rs 50,000 on anyone who dumps waste in the river. It has formed a supervisory commitee to oversee the implementation of directions passed in its 543-page judgment and submit report on it.Earlier this week, the government told the NGT that a whopping amount of over Rs 4800 crore has been spent on rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries since 1986 till June 30 this year.The Ministry of Environment and Forests told the apex environment watchdog that Rs 6788.78 crore was released by the government for the Ganga Action Plan (GAP) since it was launched by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on January 14, 1986.Out of this, Rs 4864.48 has been spent till June 30 this year, leaving an unspent balance of Rs 1924.30 crore.Nearly 32 years after a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court on pollution in the Ganga, the NGT had reserved its verdict on the second phase of the cleansing project between Haridwar to Unnao in Uttar Pradesh.The green panel, to which the 1985 PIL of noted environment activist M C Mehta was transferred by the Supreme Court in 2014, had divided the cleanliness drive in four segments of the river which passes through Uttarakhand, UP,Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, spanning a distance of over 2500 kms.Also read:NGT pulls up Haryana government, Bharti Realty over felling of trees in Aravallis on Eid weekend",general,2143,45,70

Knew about Nitish's plan for past 3-4 months: Rahul Gandhi,"Hitting out at Nitish Kumar for joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said that he knew that such a plan was in the making for the last three-four months.""We knew that this (Nitish joining hands with BJP) was being planned for the last three-four months. A person can go to any limits for his own benefit,"" Rahul Gandhi said. The Congress leader said that Nitish Kumar was given the mandate for his fight against anti-communal forces but now he has joined hands with the same forces. The big question, however, is that if Rahul Gandhi knew that Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) was in talks with the BJP to look at the possibility of rebuilding the alliance, did he do anything to put a stop to such plans. RAHUL DID NOT ACT, SAYS NITISHAfter tendering his resignation as Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar said that in the current circumstances, where deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav was accused of corruption, he was finding it difficult to continue ""to be in power"".Nitish Kumar, in an attack on Rahul Gandhi, said that while the Congress vice-president tore the ordinance exempting politicians from facing corruption charges, he did not do anything to save the Grand Alliance. A few days ago, Nitish Kumar had met Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi where the two reportedly talked about the corruption charges against Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad and his family members, including son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav.At the meeting, Nitish Kumar was believed to have conveyed to Rahul Gandhi that under present circumstances Tejashwi Yadav could not continue in his Cabinet.Given Congress' long association with RJD, many would argue that the former could have convinced Lalu Prasad to ask his son to quit the Cabinet for the time-being. SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED IN GOA TOOThis, however, is not the first time when Rahul Gandhi and the Congress leadership were found to be on the back foot despite having prior knowledge about the situation threatening to go out of their hands.In the recent Assembly election in Goa, the Congress had more seats than the BJP but lost the chance of forming the government due to alleged delay in decision-making by the leadership. As an active BJP reached out to everyone it could to get the numbers on its side, sources in the Congress said that the leadership, in particular Digvijaya Singh, was late in deciding on the leader of the legislature party. Disgruntled Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane put in his papers and joined the BJP, blaming the leadership for delay in decision-making. ""We waited from 11 am to 5 pm not knowing anything about what is happening but BJP swiftly acted,"" said Congress MLA Jennifer Monserrate.Rahul Gandhi, while crying foul over BJP forming the governments in Goa and Manipur where Congress had more seats, accused the BJP of stealing the mandate by using ""financial power"".ALSO READ:Why Nitish Kumar has almost killed Opposition chances to challenge Modi with a Grand Alliance in 2019",general,3032,59,70
Man throws his pet puppy from balcony for dropping laptop,"A man tossed his pet puppy off his first-floor balcony in Gurgaon's Sector 42 in an act of revenge after she dropped his laptop while playing with it and chewed up the DTH wires on Tuesday night.After a neighbour, who himself owns a German shepherd, heard the cries of the pup in the bushes and confronted the offender, he allegedly scooted. The four-month-old puppy suffered a fracture on her right foreleg. She was brought by the owner's wife and their neighbour to the CGS Pet Hospital in Gurugram. The canine will undergo surgery to heal the broken bone soon.Experts said this is not an isolated incident and cases of insensitivity against animals are on the rise. In July last year, two medical students - Gautam Sudarshan and Ashish Paul - flung a stray from their private college terrace in Chennai while holding her just by the ear and skin.Similarly, a psychopath, Nakul Mishra, was found stabbing dogs to death at the Green Park Metro Station in Delhi, and an unemployed Dwarka resident chopped off the hind legs of a puppy with a hacksaw when it scratched him in December 2016.PUP'S OWNER FLEESArvind Kumar, an IT professional and resident of HUDA, M-Block, sector 42 in Gurugram, who saw the incident happening on Tuesday, said, ""It was around 11 pm. I was doing my laundry in the backyard when I heard a sharp cry from a dog. When I came down to check, I saw the fearful puppy limping and hiding in the bushes.The couple, Dora Shlem and Phillip Maxwell, reached the spot too, and when I enquired from Maxwell, he denied doing anything but immediately fled in his car. His wife Dora told me everything.""Dora has given a written confession and also told Mail Today, ""Generally, we love her, but that day, it really damaged the whole laptop, chewed up wires and everything. My husband got angry and flung it.""Arvind said he will file an FIR against Maxwell.

They will be naughty and damage a shoe, furniture or TV once in a while. If you cannot tolerate their smell, hair or such acts, please do not adopt them."" LAX LAWS Activists say the laws against such crimes are very lax and their implementation is even more pathetic. Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 has provision for a maximum fine of Rs 50 and punishment of three months only.Also, Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code, which regards killing and maiming of an animal, gives a maximum punishment of five years that has so far not been given to anyone.Amita Singh, an animal rights activist and JNU professor, said, ""Our whole struggle comes to a naught when these people simply get a bail and escape with a fine of just Rs 50.""",general,2791,57,70

The trial of the surface-to-surface missile, which has a strike range of 350 km, was carried out from a mobile launcher from launch complex-3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur near here at around 9.50 am, official sources said. The trial of the sophisticated missile was successful and the mission objectives were met, they said. The Prithvi-II missile is capable of carrying 500 kg to 1,000 kg of warheads and is thrusted by liquid propulsion twin engines. It uses advanced inertial guidance system with manoeuvring trajectory to hit its target with precision and accuracy. The state-of-the-art missile was randomly chosen from the production stock and the entire launch activities were carried out by the specially formed strategic force command (SFC) and monitored by the scientists of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as part of training exercise, a DRDO scientist said. ""The missile trajectory was tracked by the DRDO radars, electro-optical tracking systems and telemetry stations located along the coast of Odisha,"" the sources said. Teams on board the ship deployed near the designated impact point in the Bay of Bengal monitored the terminal events and splashdown. In salvo mode, two Prithvi-II missiles were successfully test fired in quick succession from the same base, on November 21, 2016.

Treat first 9 months under GST as trial period: Trade body,"New Delhi, May 19 (PTI) Traders body CAIT today suggested the first nine months of GST, from its rollout date of July 1, should be treated as a trial period and no punitive action taken against businesses for procedural mistakes to allow them to get familiarised with the new regime.

Man takes pic of Hindu and Muslim praying together at dargah,"With the explosion of digital era and social media platforms came along a lot of opinions filled with hatred, meant to spread more hatred. Something as harmless as an ""Eid Mubarak"" can trigger unwarranted negative reactions directed towards you on social media platforms. This stems from the fact that there is a rising tendency, at least on social media, to filter people based on their religion and caste. For instance, The fellow, who goes by the name ""Jai Shri Ram"" on Twitter, cannot fathom how a Hindu can wish people on Eid. This may make you question your belief in the secular fabric of India, but responses to such narrow mindedness will reinstate your faith in it. India is a secular democratic. A photo taken at Delhi's Nazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah, dargah of world famous Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Syed Nizamuddin Aulia, is another example that will prove that no amount of hatred peddled through social media platforms and instant messaging applications like WhatsApp can destroy the secularism in India, within Indians. The photo tweeted by Mayank Austen Soofi, a Delhi-based writer and photojournalist, captured a scene inside the Nizamuddin Dargah -- a Muslim and Hindu praying at the shrine in their respective postures of praying.

"World champion knocked out after kick to head, cries later","Jon Jones had barely reclaimed his UFC title when he called out Brock Lesnar to be his next opponent.And Lesnar was listening.Right after Jones stopped Daniel Cormier in the third round at UFC 214 on Saturday, he reignited his growing rivalry with Lesnar, the former UFC heavyweight champion.?Brock Lesnar, if you want to know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon,? Jones said on the pay-per-view broadcast.The Associated Press reached Lesnar shortly after he watched the championship fight and then heard Jones call him out.?Be careful what you wish for, young man,? Lesnar replied.A heavyweight superfight between Jones and Lesnar would be one of the biggest events in UFC history. Lesnar is an extraordinary pay-per-view draw as likely the most popular fighter in mixed martial arts, while Jones? victory over Cormier is expected to put him back atop most pound-for-pound lists as the world?s best fighter.Lesnar returned to MMA last year with a victory, but he is under contract to the WWE as a professional wrestler until next spring.Jones and Lesnar traded verbal jabs earlier in the week. After Jones said he doubted Lesnar would ever accept a fight with him, Lesnar told the AP that he would meet Jones ?anytime, anywhere.?Lesnar is at least considering a return to the sport in which he won a UFC title in just his fourth professional fight.UFC president Dana White was in the cage when Jones called out Lesnar, and the promotion is aware of the growing buzz surrounding the matchup. White is also aware of the obstacles in its way, including the remainder of Lesnar?s suspension for failing a doping test last year.?It?s fun to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, it?s not a reality,? White said.But it?s definitely a lucrative possibility if Lesnar decides to resume training for MMA. Jones is the light heavyweight champion, but has long contemplated a move up to heavyweight ? and his post-fight comments make it clear that he?s interested.Lesnar beat Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in a unanimous decision that was changed to a no-contest after the failed test.

Well, he has allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Katika community.The offensive Baahubali 2 scene in question features Katappa (Sathyaraj) saying ""Katika cheekati"" in the second half of the film.

But because of the dispute, it could take years to reach a new contract, and royalties will likely come (as) retrospective one-time payments,"" said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an ""accumulate"" rating on Nokia shares.Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 and focused on its network business as well as a bulging portfolio of mobile device patents.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, who follows both companies, said the lawsuits were negative for Apple and Nokia due to litigation costs and uncertainty over the outcome.""The fact that this did not go to arbitration suggests, to us, that the two sides must be far apart in what each party wants,"" he wrote in a note to clients.""It appears (Apple) is not arguing the validity of the patents but, rather, the rate it deems fair,"" he said, adding Nokia could also ""choose to file a suit with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar Apple from importing handsets into the U.S."" Um rates both companies' shares as ""market perform"".Also Read: Nokia sues Apple for violating 32 technology patents",technology,2540,49,70

BJP MP Vijay Goel favours unification of 3 MCDs,"New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) Union minister Vijay Goel today batted for the unification of the three municipal corporations in the national capital saying a discussion over the issue was pertinent. The BJP leader, who was confident of a good show by his party in the MCD polls, the results of which will be declared tomorrow, said the civic bodies needed to be ""revamped"" in order to deliver the services to the people more effectively. The first thing needed was a discussion on the unification of the three municipal corporations and there should also be an end to the practice of sending Delhi government officials to serve in the civic bodies, said the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports. ""Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged,"" he said, referring to the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations. The erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC by the then Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government in 2012.

UK doctors find 27 contact lenses stuck in woman's eye,"Doctors in the UK have found 27 contact lenses stuck in a 67-year-old woman's eye while they were preparing her for a cataract surgery.The lenses, which resembled a ""blueish mass"" in the patient's eye, were causing her discomfort that she simply attributed to dry eye and old age.The case happened in November last year but has just been reported in the British Medical Journal, according to metro.co.uk.""None of us have ever seen this before. It was such a large mass. All the 17 contact lenses were stuck together. We were really surprised that the patient did not notice it because it would cause quite a lot of irritation while it was sitting there,"" Rupal Morjaria, a specialist trainee ophthalmologist who dealt with the case at Solihull Hospital near Birmingham, said.Initially, eye specialists discovered 17 lenses, before a further examination disclosed that another 10 lenses were stuck in the eye.The patient said she had been wearing monthly disposable contact lenses for 35 years but did not attend regular appointments.As a result of the findings, the woman, who said she was unaware that the lenses were missing, had her operation postponed as the risk of developing endophthalmitis, inflammation of the interior of the eye, was increased.""She was quite shocked.

Players change underwear at Wimbledon since it is not white,"Of all the rules at Wimbledon ? and there are many ? surely none is more outdated than one referring to players? clothing. Not the part that insists they should wear ?almost entirely white? attire, something players do not mind. But rather the one that refers to the colour of their underwear and how visible it is during play. First Venus Williams was asked to change her pink bra in a first-round match, which drew a suitably clipped response to a media inquiry: ?I don?t like talking about bras in press conferences. It?s weird.? On Wednesday, four junior doubles players were asked to change their underwear because it could be seen under their white shorts, and on Thursday the 18?year?old Austrian Jurij Rodionov was asked by a supervisor to show her his underwear. ?Yesterday I wore black pants and nobody said anything and today I wore blue and suddenly it?s a problem,? he said. ?It was a big surprise for me.? Rodionov said Wimbledon provided him with two white pairs. ?One was a little bit too big but these ones were OK,? he said. Asked if the rule was outdated, he said: ?Wimbledon is always special. Maybe it?s a little bit too much but I like that the players only have to wear white. It?s tradition.?On the eve of the championships, Andre Agassi said he did not want to consult Novak Djokovic?s former coach Boris Becker to get an idea of what to expect as he began his new role working with the Serb, because he was trying to avoid going in with any preconceptions. That is definitely not the case for Jonas Bjorkman, who has been coaching Marin Cilic since August of last year.

India's only existing steam engine put on display in Haryana,"A shiny, sleek white steam engine huffing and puffing away, much like us in this stifling heat, is an unusual sight in the middle of nowhere, just beyond Bilaspur in Haryana. Located at the Heritage Transport Museum, India's only transport museum, the steam engine was unveiled at the museum on Saturday.Home to about 2,500 curated vintage cars, buses, trains and pre-mechanised modes of transportation like bullock carts and even boats and an aviation gallery, the museum is the brainchild of Tarun Thakral, founder and managing trustee, and traces the evolution of modes of transport in India.""There aren't any steam engines operational because it's quite expensive. Even the toy trains work on diesel or battery. So, the younger genera-tion has no idea what a steam engine looks like or functions. This is an opportunity for them to see the same,"" says Tarun. The 12.5-ft tall and 31-ft long engine moved back and forth on the relatively small track, using wood to obtain the steam. The engine, originally built in 1953 by a German locomotive manufacturer, has been restored from its dilapidated condition in which it was found in Bihar. ""It took three months to restore it, while permissions and talks with the Indian Railways to acquire it took about three years. We are using wood here because coal quality is not good,"" says Tarun.

"UK, Netherlands biggest channels for tax avoidance: Study","Almost 40% of corporate investments channelled away from authorities and into tax havens travel through the UK or the Netherlands, according to a study of the ownership structures of 98m firms.The two EU states are way ahead of the rest of the world in terms of being a preferred option for corporations who want to exploit tax havens to protect their investments.The Netherlands was a conduit for 23% of corporate investments that ended in a tax haven, a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam concluded. The UK accounted for 14%, ahead of Switzerland (6%), Singapore (2%) and Ireland (1%).Every year multinationals avoid paying £38bn-£158bn in taxes in the EU using tax havens. In the US, tax evasion by multinational corporations via offshore jurisdictions is estimated to be at least $130bn (£99bn) a year. The researchers reported that there were 24 so-called ?sink? offshore financial centres where foreign capital was ultimately stored, safe from the tax authorities.Of those, 18 are said to have a current or past dependence to the UK, such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and Jersey.The tax havens used correlated heavily to which conduit country was chosen by the multinational?s accountants.The UK is a major conduit for investments going to European countries and former members of the British Empire, such as Hong Kong, Jersey, Guernsey or Bermuda, reflecting the historical links and tax treaties enjoyed by firms setting up in Britain. The Netherlands is a principal conduit for investment ending in Cyprus and Bermuda, among others. Switzerland is used as a conduit to Jersey. Ireland is the route for Japanese and American companies to Luxembourg.In terms of the purpose, on paper, of the corporate structures, the Netherlands specialises in providing holding companies. The UK provides head offices and fund management and Ireland offers financial leasing and the provision of head offices.?Our results show that offshore finance is not the exclusive business of exotic small islands far away,? the researchers write in an article for theacademic journal Scientific Reports. ?Countries such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom play a crucial yet previously hidden role as conduits of offshore finance on its way to tax havens.?Dr Eelke Heemskerk, who led the research, said that the work showed the importance of developed countries cleaning up their financial sectors.He said: ?In the context of Brexit, where you have the UK threatening, unless they get a deal, to change their model to be attractive to companies who want to protect themselves from taxes, well, they are already doing it.?The Netherlands says they won?t let the UK be an offshore tax haven.

Notice to 100 WB schools for promoting religious intolerance,"West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee today said that around 100 schools were show caused following allegations of attempt to influence innocent minds through teachings that might promote religious intolerance. The minister told the Assembly that the government had taken note of such activities taking place in some schools, particularly in parts of north Bengal and North 24-Parganas district in south Bengal. Chatterjee said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in her capacity as the Home minister, had also given him a list of some schools allegedly indulging in such activities and after due process the ""no objection certificate"" (NOC) of some of these institutions were cancelled. Warning that the government would not allow any attempt to promote religious intolerance through teachings in some private schools, the minister said that educational institutions would have to adhere to the syllabus of the board to which these are affiliated.

The minister was replying to a question on steps being taken by the state government over reports of some private educational institutions teaching outside their syllabus and curriculum with some hidden religious agenda.

Sania Mirza's ex-partner wins Wimbledon mixed doubles,"Jamie Murray ensured the family name will be on a Wimbledon trophy for the third time in five years as he and the former world No1 Martina Hingis beat the defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen of Finland 6-4, 6-4 to win the mixed doubles crown.After the painful end to Andy Murray?s title defence, it was left to Jamie to produce the goods and he and Hingis, the No1 seeds, duly clinched victory in 74 minutes.?I have to thank Martina for asking me as I wasn?t going to play mixed doubles,? Murray said. ?When she texted me, it was an easy decision to play, she?s such a great player. Anyone in the locker room would have jumped at the chance to play with her. I really enjoyed the whole week. It?s a great achievement. Any time you win a grand slam, get your name up on the board again, it?s there forever. No one will take it away from you.?Andy Murray, notoriously nervous when watching his brother play, was lurking in the locker room during the match but was there to congratulate him soon after he came off court. ?I just saw him there,? Jamie said. ?He said he came in the middle of the first set. I think he just waited in the lockers. He said he didn?t watch it. I don?t know if he snuck a few points in or not.?With Murray and Watson on opposite sides of the net, it was a win-win situation for British fans on Centre Court, most of whom had stuck around after seeing Roger Federer clinch a record eighth singles title earlier in the day. And they were rewarded with a match full of power, angles, deft volleys and outstanding movement around the net, especially from Murray, whose net skills left the crowd gasping at times.Hingis was the runner-up to Kontinen and Watson last year alongside Leander Paes but when she dumped the Indian in favour of Murray, the Scot knew he had a great chance to add to his grand slam tally. Ten years after partnering Jelena Jankovic to victory here, this was his fourth grand slam crown in all while Hingis took her total to 23, five singles, 12 women?s doubles and six mixed, five of which have come since the beginning of 2015.The big-hitting Kontinen, the men?s doubles world No1, had his moments and Watson held her own but last year?s champions were always up against it with Hingis?s dipping returns perfectly complementing Murray?s sharp net play. After trading early breaks, Watson was broken for the second time at 3-3 and they closed out the opening set.Kontinen and Watson had two chances to break the Murray serve at 3-2 up in the second set but could not take them. A slightly mis-hit return from Hingis set up two break points for the top seeds on the Watson serve at 3-3 and they took the second to get the vital break as Watson hit a forehand into the net. After Hingis held to love, the pair saved three break points to serve out for the title.Kontinen said he and Watson had not taken their chances but they hope to team up again next year. Murray and Hingis have yet to discuss future plans but it seems likely they will defend their title next summer and they may even play together in the US Open later this summer.Hingis, who won the singles here 20 years ago, admitted she was ?not used to no? when she asks someone to play mixed doubles. ?Here, it?s always tough,? she said. ?I understand in the past guys would have said no because they really want to focus on doubles only because it?s three?out-of-five [sets]. This is the only tournament that still does it. It?s definitely easier to ask somebody at the other three grand slams and not Wimbledon.

But one thing you gotta stop doing my nigga, I?m gonna be real with you: stop bringing my daughter into this my nigga. Stop saying shit about my fucking daughter.? The fight became a reality on Thursday, when Mayweather ? who is now a boxing promoter ? posted an image on his Instagram plugging the fight as ?Mayweather Promotions Presents ? celebrity boxing live on pay-per-view?. Soulja Boy reposted the image, adding: ?Signed my contract I?m leaving the fight with $1,000,000 I got the best ever my big bro @floydmayweather training me damn ? March in Vegas!! On TV.?He followed that with a video of him and Mayweather, with the former boxer saying, ?We gotta get the money? and Soulja Boy responding: ?The biggest fight of the century.?",general,1821,58,70

"Mamata calls for peace in Darjeeling, flies to Netherlands","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appealed for calm and peace after a weekend of violence in Darjeeling hills, where the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha is observing an indefinite shutdown. Uneasy calm prevailed on Sunday after GJM activists were allegedly shot dead by security forces in clashes on Saturday. The protesters, who are pressing for a separate state of Gorkhaland, took out a large rally on Sunday with the bodies of activists allegedly killed in police firing. CM Banerjee, who left for the Netherlands today to address a United Nations meet, accused GJM of trying to create an ""ethnic"" divide in Darjeeling and said violence won't be tolerated.

"Reddit user claims AIB's Rohan molested her, later denies it","All India Bakchod funnyman Rohan Joshi was accused of molesting and sexually harassing a woman in an anonymous Reddit post earlier today. Less than two hours later, the same person replaced that post with one that called Joshi a ""great guy"". What was the motive behind such a move? Read on their post to find out:Whoever this person is, disregard of what gender they come from, has single-handedly reduced a serious issue like sexual harassment to a joke. As he/she points out, the intention behind the original post (accusing Joshi of molestation) was to ""expose"" the woman who accused TVF CEO of sexually harassing her.Well, good job, buddy! You tricked us into believing that you were touched, groped and felt up against your consent. Of course, this is an issue that should be toyed with. Very, well done!THE ORIGINAL POSTThe Reddit user, under the pseudonym 'shadenfreude557', had claimed in the now-removed post that Joshi had tried to forcefully kiss 'her', then verbally abused and groped 'her breast' when 'she' pushed him away. It further said that they ""couldn't share this experience with anyone because of the fear that no one will believe"", given his celebrity status.This post was taken down less than an hour later. JOSHI'S RESPONSEWhen Twitter users drew Rohan's attention to the original Reddit post, he denied the accusation and challenged the claim saying he is ""open to any investigation about this by cops or by anyone at all"".@lordoftheshibs Wow. Kucch bhi. Literally. Happily open to any investigation about this by cops or by anyone at allJoshi also tweeted: I would like to state categorically that this did not happen. I am open and willing, and even urge @MumbaiPolice to investigate thisBut any competent authority who wants to investigate is welcome to, and I encourage whoever wrote that to pursue the matter earnestly.When another Twitter user brought to Joshi's attention the new Reddit post, claiming he is a ""great guy"", and rubbishing the sexual harassment claims, Joshi just 'sighed'. Sigh. I have no idea what is going on anymore. I think I've had enough internet for the week. https://t.co/XzggjLBlqfI still welcome any investigation, for the record. Feel free to expand it into an investigation on whether I threatened anyone even https://t.co/AxeKJMECTQTHE TVF MOLESTATION CASEThe case this blessed Reddit user was trying to expose as false is that of TVF CEO Arunabh Kumar, who has been accused of molesting multiple women.The case went viral on the social media after one former TVF employee shared her sexual harassment experience in a blog post on the Medium. As the post gained traction, a stream of charges came flooding in against Kumar with other women accusing Kumar of the same.So, our star Reddit user was trying to ""expose"" this anonymous woman, who posted her story under the name The Indian Fowler, by crying wolf about being sexually harassed.

Ultralight paper device can be charged with body movements,"Washington, Apr 17 (PTI) Inspired by the Chinese and Japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. Despite the many advances in portable electronic devices, one thing remains constant - the need to plug them into a wall socket to recharge. Portable electronic devices, such as watches, hearing aids and heart monitors, often require only a little energy. They usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries. Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology in the US and Chongqing University in China wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements. They have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics. However, most TENG devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy. Researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit. The four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element.",general,1428,58,70

What are Jadhav's options to challenge Pak death sentence?,"Former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav was today awarded capital punishment by a military court in Pakistan.The Field General Court Martial (FGCM) sentenced Kulbhushan Jadhav to death on the charges of ""espionage and sabotage activities"". FGCM is a military court consisting of Pakistan Army officers. The judges on the FGCM aren't required to possess law degrees.HOW IT HAPPENED WITH KULBHUSHAN JADHAVPakistan Army General Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence to Kulbhushan Jadhav after the Field General Court Martial found him guilty of ""all the charges"".An ISPR release said, ""The spy was tried through Field General Court Martial under the Pakistan Army Act and awarded the death sentence. Today Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed his death sentence awarded by FGCM.""The military court was not closed to outsiders. Kulbhushan Jadhav was not given consular access as demanded by Indian authorities.Pakistan maintained that providing a defending officer during his trial at the Field General Court Martial as per legal provisions of the military court of Pakistan was enough defence for Kulbhushan Jadhav.OPTIONS BEFORE KULBHUSHAN JADHAVThe military courts of Pakistan have unbridled rights and unmatched jurisdiction. They have the right to try civilians for several crimes. The government can also transfer cases to the military courts of Pakistan.The Pakistan government gave an extension to the military courts of Pakistan after the December 2015 terror attack on a Peshawar school.Interestingly, the military courts of Pakistan do not have trained judges or judges with any kind of mandatory legal training.According to existing laws in Pakistan, the military court convicts cannot appeal in a civilian court. This means the possibility of a fair trial is not available for Kulbhushan Jadhav.But, there are two options available to Kulbhushan Jadhav:- According to the Pakistan Army Act 1952, Kulbhushan Jadhav can appeal in the Military Appellate Tribunal. However, the chances of getting a different verdict are slim.- The second option available to Kulbhushan Jadhav is to appeal in a civilian court for 'review' of the FGCM judgment. According to the Pakistan Army Act Section 7.2.3, military court convicts can have the decisions 'reviewed' by civilian courts, where Kulbhushan can have a lawyer of his choice. The government of India can also find a lawyer to defend him if Pakistan gives Kulbhushan Jadhav consular access.HOW MILITARY COURTS OPERATE IN PAKISTANThe human rights activists of Pakistan have questioned the very existence of military courts especially for trial of civilians. According to the International Court of Justice, Pakistan is the only South Asian country to allow trial of civilians by military courts.The principle of fair justice warrants a written judgment by a court of law. The written judgment explains the reasoning and logic behind the verdicts. But, the military courts of Pakistan are not required to give any such document. Even the families of the convicts are not told about the investigation and evidence related to the case.According to a report released by the ISPR about the trial of the cases for 2016, about 90 per cent of the accused confessed to the charges framed by the military courts. Kulbhushan Jadhav's confession was one of them.The unusually high percentage of confession to crimes by the accused in military courts raises serious doubts about the credibility of the statements. This indicates questionable interrogation and torture to elicit favourable confessions. ALSO READ | Who is Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian sentenced to death in Pakistan?",general,3649,58,70

The data does not indicate whether these complaints were found to be true or false.Also, more than 57% of the complaints from Assam are shown as pending.?J&K accounted for 49.5% of the human rights complaints received against the armed forces during this period (2012 to January 2016),? the reply said. ?A little more than 31% of the complaints were received from the people in Assam. Manipur accounted for a little more than 11% of the total number of complaints. Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura accounted for less than 10 complaints each. Only one complaint was received from Nagaland during this period,? according to the reply.?About 40% of the complaints are clubbed under the category ?defence forces? without any detailing as to what kinds of complaints they are,? according to the ministry reply.?When the distinct categories of ?death in army encounter? and ?death in army firing? are added, the proportion of complaints received against the defence forces goes up to more than 61% of the total number of complaints received against all armed forces operating in the seven states,? Nayak said.The RTI response also says ten of these complaints relate to the crime of abduction and rape -- received from Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir and Tripura. The data also shows that monetary relief to the tune of Rs 6.47 crore was recommended in 117 cases. ?It is not known whether this was ex-gratia relief granted or compensation awarded. Further, it is not known how many complainants or victims actually received the monetary relief and which government (Central or State) made the payments,? Nayak said.While Jammu and Kashmir accounted for almost 50 per cent of the complaints, its share in the monetary relief recommended was a mere three per cent at Rs 21 lakh, it was revealed.?Only five cases were found to be eligible for monetary relief in J&K. On the other hand, Assam, which accounted for less than a third of the complaints, received the largest proportion (48%) of monetary relief recommended by the government.

Taapsee Pannu's 'Naam Shabana' hits the theatres,"Naam Shabana, starring Taapsee Pannu in the lead role, is a spin-off of the 2015 hit Baby. Will the big Bollywood release this week match up to the success of Baby? Here is our Naam Shabana movie review.Naam Shabana Cast: Taapsee Pannu, Akshay Kumar, Manoj Bajpayee, Anupam Kher, Prithviraj SukumaranNaam Shabana Director: Shivam NairNaam Shabana Rating: (2.5/5)The surprise package of Baby, Taapsee Pannu, kicking some serious butt, Akshay Kumar's one-liners and lots of thrills - Naam Shabana looks full of crowd-pleasers on the surface, and if in doubt, there's always Bharat Mata Ki Jai. The problem is that the trailer gave it all away, which, by default, makes the first half of Naam Shabana a drag.Shabana (Taapsee) is a reserved second year B.Com student whose life revolves around Kudo training and her widowed mother. Her classmate Jai (Taher Mithaiwala) is smitten by her, but is only stuck with ferrying her back-and-forth from college, because she does not entertain his declarations of love. When they finally go on a date, she opens up about her dark past and finally reciprocates his feelings. But their yet-to-bloom romance is cut short when, on their way home, they get pursued by eve-teasers and a tragedy follows.From this point, the making of Shabana, the lethal spy, starts. ""Females are born with an extra strain in their DNA. Mardon ko gadgets ki zaroorat padti hai, auratein pre-configured aati hai,"" Manoj Bajpayee's character says when Shabana asks him why the agency chose her out of the crores of people. You don't know whether to laugh.But laughs there are, in the form of Baby nostalgia. Akshay's ""conference"" moment and ""mantriji toh aaj bahut busy hai"" make a comeback in Naam Shabana. There is also a subtle dig at quintessential action sequences where the hero and the villain rip off their shirts and have a fist fight (think Dabangg), which elicits some chuckles.The hunky antagonist Prithviraj Sukumaran is as dangerous as he is handsome. But for reasons best known to the makers, he divulges key information about himself after years of painstakingly (quite literally, as you'll find out) staying under the radar. And it is never quite explained why a rookie like Shabana must take him out, when one of their best, Akshay, just sits and twiddles his thumbs. (Note that the baddie has already eliminated five seasoned agents who went to apprehend him.)It is perhaps to the director Shivam Nair's credit that in spite of the loopholes, Naam Shabana gives us some enjoyable moments. Taapsee is the hero of the film, save in the few scenes with Akshay, when he steals the limelight from her because ""itne door se aaya hoon, kuch toh karne do!"" And although Taapsee shoulders the film, her name appears in the end credits only AFTER Akshay's, in spite of his role being only an extended cameo. Sigh. The two club songs could have been done away with; although they are woven into the plot, they come across as jarring in a film like this. Especially amidst strong comments on counter-terrorism vis-a-vis the socio-political situation. Shabana is told that her Muslim identity is an advantage to the agency because, ""Aaj kal ke jo haalat hai, us mein tumhare religion ki vajah se humara access badhta hai aur raaste khulte hai."" It would have been interesting to explore that in some more depth, but it is never addressed again.",entertainment,3362,48,70

Bombay HC orders stay on Raveena Tandon's film 'Maatr',"The Bombay High Court has put a stay on the release of actor Raveena Tandon's comeback film Maatr, which was scheduled for release on April 21. This move came after a private financial institution YT Capital Pvt Ltd petitioned the Bombay High Court against the film's producer Anjum Rizvi and has also made T-series, the film's co-producer, a party.While hearing the petition on Thursday, Justice Gautam Patel of the Bombay High Court noted that YT Capital Pvt Ltd had obtained an order in their favour against the film producers in an earlier petition where an amount of Rs 2,44,71,718 was due from Rizvi and had not been paid to the company. The court noted that ""an Agreement for co-production dated 22nd September 2014 made it clear that the Decree Holder (YT Capital) would not only have a lien on the previous films but all future feature films or television serials of Rizvi and that these would not be released or distributed till the debt was paid.""YT Capital had given this loan to Rizvi in 2014 for the movie Katha, which never released. Rizvi never paid this amount back, which is why the company has had to take such coercive action.The court noted that makers of Maatr, which is scheduled to release this month, had been issued summons but they never appeared before the court. The company is seeking an order of restraint against the release of this film and a court-appointed receiver till the debt is paid.The film Maatr, starring Raveena Tandon, Alisha Khan and Madhur Mittal is about a mother whose daughter is raped and dies, while the mother carries on with her fight to get justice. The petitioner had requested that the court should pass an order restraining the producers from parting with the release prints and/or negatives of the film. The company also wants the court to pass an order restraining Rizvi from selling or creating any third party rights whatsoever in the negatives of his previously released seven films - John Day, India Metro, A Flat, Fast Forward, A Wednesday, Ahista Ahista, Charges: A Joint Effort as well.",general,2053,55,70

Canada PM Trudeau slammed over indigenous politician comment,"In one corner stood Canada?s youngest senator, heavily tattooed and armed with a black belt in karate. In the other stood a lanky Justin Trudeau, the underdog whom bookies were giving 3-1 odds against.That 2012 boxing match marked a pivotal moment in Trudeau?s political career. But his account of the episode is now raising eyebrows, after he offered a glimpse into his decision to take on indigenous politician Patrick Brazeau.?It wasn?t random,? Trudeau told Rolling Stone magazine in an interview published this week. ?I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an indigenous community. He fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint. I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.?The comments ? part of a 6,800-word August cover story on the prime minister ? sparked immediate reaction. ?So ?privileged white guy beats up Indian? was the ?right kind of narrative?? Seriously?? wrote one person on Twitter, while another noted: ?White guy in power & entitlement looks 4 an #Indigenous human to beat up so he looks like a strong white dude. How precious & colonial supreme.?Others pointed to Trudeau?s much vaunted commitments to diversity and tackling the deep-rooted inequities facing many indigenous peoples in Canada. ?What is up @JustinTrudeau after all your talk of inclusion you brag about beating up a guy with the issues you swore to address,? tweeted one. Another said: ?Trudeau literally using indigenous people as political props.? The encounter came to a halt in the third round as Trudeau pummelled Brazeau in a corner, but it marked the beginning of Trudeau?s rise to Canada?s top office. Brazeau ? who told reporters after the match that it was his ego, not his reddened nose, that was most hurt ? would later be cast out of the Conservative caucus following a 2013 arrest for sexual assault and domestic abuse.As Trudeau?s description of planning the boxing match made the rounds online, some questioned how it squared with Trudeau?s promise to repair the country?s relationship with the more than 1.4 million indigenous peoples ? many of whom grapple with rates of poverty, incarceration and suicide that are much higher than non-indigenous Canadians.Many continue to reel from the effects of Canada?s church-run residential school system ? described by last year?s truth commission as a tool of cultural genocide ? while systemic inequalities have left some living in inadequate, overcrowded housing with undrinkable water.Algonquin artist Jay Odjick pointed to Trudeau?s comments as a possible explanation for the slow pace of reconciliation. ?Canada, your leader went to US media today saying that when he needed a villain to fit his narrative, an indigenous person was a good fit,? he wrote on Twitter. ?The sad fact is, WE are the only people he could get away with in terms of this. Think about perception if he had chosen another PoC person.? On Thursday, Trudeau?s office pointed to the launch of a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous girls and women as well as government promises for investment in education, infrastructure and healthcare to highlight the prime minister?s commitment to Indigenous issues. ?He has made it clear that there is no relationship more important to him ? and to our government ? than reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,? a spokesperson for Trudeau said in a statement to the Guardian. ?We are fully committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship and to reconciliation.?The Rolling Stone interview ? promoted on the magazine with the question ?Why can?t he be our president?? ? prompted intense debate in Canada. Many lauded the profile, which included phrases such as ?For Trudeau, listening is seducing? and sought to contrast Trudeau with Donald Trump. Polls suggest Trudeau?s approval rating among Canadians remains high, at around 53%, 20 months after his government took power. But others reacted with skepticism, pointing to Trudeau?s broken promises on electoral reform and deficit spending as well as his government?s sluggish response in addressing indigenous issues.?This yearning for an anti-Trump to call their own means the US media are glossing over or ignoring the troubling similarities between both leaders, not the least of which is an obsession with celebrity that is ultimately counterproductive to governance,? wrote Toronto Star columnist Vinay Menon. ?The attention might be nice. But a bit more neighbourly honesty would be even better.?",world,4529,60,70
"Naxalism has killed 12,000 people in 20 yrs: Rajnath Singh","Home Minister Rajnath Singh today chaired a Left Wing Extremism (LWE) situation review meeting where he unveiled a new strategy to counter Naxalim in the country.

FIR ordered against woman cop for sexually assaulting girl,"A Delhi court has ordered an FIR against a woman police officer for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl, who had earlier accused her teacher of molesting her. The Delhi Police, however, said they will begin internal probe in the matter and challenge the order in high court if the charges were found to be false.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, on Monday, passed the order after the 13-year-old girl told the court that she was sexually assaulted by the woman investigating officer (IO) of the case and she had lodged a complaint with the police against her but no action was taken.The court also dismissed the third bail plea of the teacher of a government school, facing prosecution in the case, saying there was no change in circumstances.?Today, separate directions have been given for lodging of FIR against the IO in this case for having committed penetrative sexual assault upon the child victim and creating false evidence.?Needless to say, false evidence was being created by the IO solely to accord benefit thereof to the applicant/accused Manoj Rathi (teacher). Be that as it may, I do not find any change in the circumstance warranting taking different view. The bail application of the applicant accordingly stands dismissed,? the judge said.The court directed the SHO of Mangolpuri in north west Delhi to get the FIR registered against woman IO, a sub-inspector, through a senior officer and file a status report in the matter on April 29.Senior police officers, however, said that they were yet to receive a copy of the court order. They said the court?s order will be examined by their legal department. ?We will defend the woman investigating officer if the charges against her are found baseless. For this, we will challenge the city court?s order in the high court. But if the charges are found true, we will certainly register a case against the woman officer and take strictest possible action under law,? the officer said. The officer said that the court has asked them to file the status report on February 29. ?We still have 10 days to complete our internal enquiry, take legal opinion and decide our further course of action,? the officer said.The girl, in her complaint, alleged that the IO had threatened her father to get the victim medically re-examined or she would implicate her in a false case.The child alleged that initially the woman official sexually assaulted her and later took her to a hospital where the doctors conducted her internal medical examination without her consent.The police which is already probing the aspect of sexual assault on the minor by her teacher, had earlier informed the court that it has also registered an FIR against the girl?s father in view of the alleged confession letter which was given to the police by the school staff.The school staff had given to police an alleged confession letter of the girl?s father that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted her.The initial incident occurred in August last year when the girl, a Class V student of a government school in Aman Vihar area of North-West Delhi, asked a question to the teacher who told her to meet him alone later.The girl said in her complaint that the teacher allegedly molested her and when her parents came to the school next day to complain about his conduct, he threatened them and took thumb impression of the child?s father on a blank paper.The teacher then allegedly wrote a confession letter on behalf of the girl?s father that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted his daughter and got the signatures of other colleagues, she had alleged. Later, a case under the POCSO Act was registered by the police against the accused teacher.The police have also lodged a case against other school teachers and principal for not informing them about an alleged confession letter of a minor girl?s father.(With PTI inputs)",general,3858,58,70

Yuvraj was picked to ease burden on MS Dhoni: Virat Kohli,"The seasoned Yuvraj Singh was recalled to India's limited-overs teams to lend solidity to an inexperience middle-order and ease the burden on Mahendra Singh Dhoni, captain Virat Kohli said here on Saturday. (Captaincy not a burden, it will make me better: Virat Kohli)Yuvraj's last ODI was against South Africa at Centurion in December 2013. He though played his last T20I versus Australia in Mohali last March during the ICC World Twenty20.""Yes, that (experience) is something we have discussed before picking Yuvi because we cannot leave so much burden on MS (Dhoni) alone in the middle order. I am willing to take up responsibility up the order, but there needs to be one more guy with him (Dhoni) down the order in case the top order doesn't fire,"" Kohli said on the eve of the first of three One-Day Internationals against England. (India seek fresh start under Virat Kohli in first ODI vs England)'JADHAV, PANDYA CAN LEARN A LOT FROM YUVRAJ, DHONI'Kohli said the team's think-tank needed to get its combination right quickly as these were the only games it had in its hands before the Champions Trophy in June. (Kohli lauds Dhoni's smart decision-making)""If the top order doesn't fire you are left with MS alone and he is guiding the youngsters more often than not. Which is fine, if you have 15-20 games till a big tournament (begins).But when you have only three games to prepare for a big tournament, I think you need to get all your resources in place.""You need to make sure the guys who have been picked are in good form,"" said Kohli who added that Ambati Rayudu had also been considered to do this specific job but was injured for a long time. (Virat Kohli's Team India will rewrite history, says MS Dhoni)""So, right now we don't have the time to nurture the one spot as much because we have a big tournament coming up straightaway, that's why Yuvi was brought into the team. We had discussed Rayudu as well, but he has been injured for a long time and didn't have game-time behind him. Yuvi has had a very good first-class season, so obviously he was into the team before anyone else.""So, I think this just gives the team much more balance in the middle and lower-middle order with MS and Yuvi. They can really guide Kedar (Jadhav) and Hardik (Pandya) still with them, but to have two experienced guys compared to one is a massive difference. I am sure Hardik and Kedar can learn a lot from them, batting along with them."" (Kohli already has a formidable record as ODI captain)ON CHAMPIONS TROPHY",general,2509,57,70

She can read between the lines and has a strong sixth sense. I'm very gullible, I take everything at face value,"" the actor elaborates.The toughest part of getting into Shabana's shoes was not the physical aspect of it, contrary to what people think.

43 McDonald's joints ran without health permits for 3 months,"New Delhi, Jul 7 (PTI) US fast food chain McDonalds 43 outlets in the national capital operated without valid health licences for nearly three months from April 1, its estranged India partner Vikram Bakshi has alleged. Last month, McDonalds had decided to shut down 43 of the total 55 outlets here due to failure to renew eating house licences. Bakshi, an equal joint venture partner of McDonalds India Pvt Ltd (MIPL) in Connaught Plaza Restaurants Ltd (CPRL), the licensee for North and East India regions, said licences had expired on March 31. ""From April 1 to June 27, 2017, we did not have any health licence, its absolutely correct,"" Bakshi told PTI. He has been at loggerheads with McDonalds since 2013 when he was removed as the managing director of CPRL and is contesting it at legal forums, including the London Court of Arbitration. Bakshi said the health licence was necessary from local municipal bodies to run the restaurants for water hygiene and proper maintenance of food, among others. When contacted to confirm if the company operated those 43 outlets without valid health licences, Barry Sum, Director - Corporate Relations, Asia Foundational Markets, McDonalds, declined to comment. ""We want to focus our efforts on resolving the issues as soon as possible at this moment,"" he said. The closed outlets are unlikely to open any time soon as Bakshi has refused to sign the licensing documents. To renew it, the JV partner and an MIPL-nominated director have to co- sign licence renewal applications. Bakshi said: ""In early March before the licences were to go for renewal, I have clearly stated that because of issues of food safety and because of us not actually providing quality and safe food to customers, I no longer intend to sign (to apply for renewal of) the licences."" Sum blamed Bakshi for the closing of the outlets. ""The current situation is the result of our former JV partners refusal to co-sign the licence renewal applications with an MIPL-nominated director, which were the protocols previously approved by the CPRL board,"" he said. The restaurants will reopen when the required licences have been obtained, Sum said. MIPL still intends to look for a constructive resolution to the situation so that the impact on stakeholders will be mitigated. This will require the appointment of someone from CPRL other than the directors, he added. Bakshi defended his decision, saying once he was removed from the post of managing director in 2013, he no longer had the authority.",general,2506,60,70

Flipkart must grow with careful cost considerations: Binny,"Bengaluru, Apr 10 (PTI) Flipkart Co-founder Binny Bansal today said while the latest funding round provides the fuel the company needs to reach its goal of transforming commerce in India through technology, it should continue to grow its business with careful considerations to costs. ""I must stress that we still have some distance to go before fulfilling our mission - to transform commerce in India through technology. And, while this funding round provides the fuel we need need to reach that goal, we have to continue growing our business with careful considerations to costs,"" he said in a mail shot-off to his employees after raising USD 1.4 billion from Tencent Holdings, Microsoft Corp and eBay Inc. ""I look forward to your continued support,"" he added. The announcement comes in the wake of Flipkart, Indias largest e-commerce player, looking to cut cost by its plan to sack at least 700 employees, or over 3 per cent of its workforce, to compete with rivals like Amazon and Snapdeal. The funding announcement comes in the wake of Flipkart, being in the eye of a storm in recent times for lowering of valuation, which prompted them to make several changes in its business model, including raising margins, it charges from sellers. A host of Flipkarts investors had marked down their valuation estimates by up to 39 per cent in the recent past. At its peak, Flipkart was valued at over USD 15 billion (roughly Rs 1,00,830 crore). Giving reasons for the significance of the latest funding, Binny Bansal said it is the largest in the companys 10-year history and also in Indias internet sector. Bansal also said it provides solid growth capital so that the company can cement and extend its lead in Indias e-commerce market, and its valuation remains healthy and in double-digits, reflective of the current business and global economy. ""I am particularly excited from the strong confidence global tech giants have shown in our abilities. It is just an acknowledgement of the strides we have taken in improving peoples lives, it is also an endorsement of the opportunities ahead,"" he said. Bansal said the deals that the company has struck are important for them as e-commerce space accounts for less than two per cent of all retail in India and the potential for online retail alone is about USD 100 billion. ""As I have said before, the potential is vast and we have only just scratched the surface. E-commerce accounts for less than two per cent of all retail in India and the potential for online retail alone is about USD 100 billion. Which is why these deals are particularly important for all of us,"" he said. Bansal said these partnerships bring in a lot more than funds and set the company to compete more aggressively through innovations, which will enable them to collaborate deeply with eBay on cross-border trade and ensure their customers have a wider selection of international products to choose from. ""Tencent, one of the largest internet companies in the world, and Microsoft also join us as strategic investors,"" he added.",general,3047,58,70
Another suspicious packet of powder found inside UP Assembly,"Security agencies have found a packet of suspicious powder inside the Uttar Pradesh assembly two days after discovering plastic explosives inside the premises, an incident that sent shockwaves through the political establishment. Sources said, on Friday evening, security personnel found a sealed packet containing some powder weighing about 50 grams during a check. This came after 150 grams of the high-potential explosive Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) powder was found near the seat of the leader of opposition on July 12.The sealed packet was handed over to the city police for further examination. The state Anti Terror Squad (ATS) and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Aseem Arun confirmed the recovery and added that primary inquiry suggested the packet contained magnesium sulphate and would be sent for the forensic examination. He said the magnesium sulphate is used as drying agent for packing material. Arun said pan masala and other eatables packets are usually thrown inside the premises and that anti-mine, anti-sabotage and bomb disposal squads were sanitising every corner of the Vidhan Bhawan premises. On July 12, the recovery of PETN powder weighing around 150 grams below the chair?s cushion in the arena where legislators sit during the assembly session triggered panic. Sleuths initially believed the PETN was simple powder and sent it for forensic examination at State Forensic Science Laboratory in Mahanagar, Lucknow. The alert was sounded after the forensic experts confirmed it as high-potential explosive on Friday. A PETN sample however is also been sent to explosive unit of Agra forensic science laboratory for check its purity level. An FIR against unidentified persons was also lodged with Hazratganj police station on Friday after the recovery of explosive powder.The PETN recovery has prompted chief minister Yogi Adityanath to tighten security and call for a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe.Police think the explosives were transported into UP from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh or some other state where it is often used for mining.

MP witnessed deaths of 28K kids below 6 yrs of age in 2016,"More than 28,000 children aged less than six years have died in Madhya Pradesh in the past one year due to malnourishment and diseases resulting from it.The state women and child welfare department while accepting that children died because of disease resulting from malnourishment refuses to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.Women and child welfare department minister Archana Chitnis read out an answer to a question raised by Ram Niwas Rawat of the Congress in the ongoing budget session of the Assembly in which she accepted that 28948 children had died in the state in the past one year. And though malnourishment related deaths have been reported from across the state she refused to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.""Technically It is impossible to answer how many children died because of malnourishment because children died because of various disease which could have resulted from malnourishment. But I can tell you as far as malnourishment figures are concerned we have improved on all parameters,"" Archana Chitnis said while talking to India Today.Children have died across the state but we chose to do a reality check in Satna where according to the minister's reply 2167 children below the age of 6 have died due to various reasons. Majhagava block is the worst affected where around 1000 malnourished kids who have been admitted to the rehabilitation centres set up by the government. Many deaths have been reported from the 19 odd tribal dominated villages that fall in this block but the government is not willing to accept malnourishment and severe malnourishment as the cause.Leader of opposition Ajay Singh however attributes corruption as the cause behind the rising deaths of infants in Madhya Pradesh. ""Satna is there, also Chitrakoot is there and in Majhgava block there is severe malnourishment. The reason behind this is corruption. Those who are supposed to supply nutritional food are associated with the BJP and till the time this cartel is broken malnourishment cannot be tackled in Madhya Pradesh,"" he told India Today.If we break down the annual death figure of 28948 into days a shocking statistic stares at your face. 79 children aged below six years die every day in Madhya Pradesh and this shows that the infant mortality rate in Madhya Pradesh is worse than even many African nations.

Sports firm boss wins case on ?126cr deal he made when drunk,"Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has won a high court battle over a £15m deal allegedly made in a London pub, calling time on a case that will be long remembered for days of evidence concerning excessive alcohol consumption.The case revolved around investment banker Jeffrey Blue?s allegation that during a ?night of heavy drinking? at the Horse and Groom pub near Sports Direct?s Oxford Street store in January 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him £15m if the company?s shares doubled to £8.However, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Leggatt, who had said he found the case was ?a lot more interesting than some?, ruled that no one would have thought what Ashley said in the pub was ?serious?.?The Sports Direct senior management meetings certainly show that Mr Ashley is happy to combine discussion of business matters with the consumption of alcohol,? the judge said in his ruling. ?But there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Ashley has ever negotiated or concluded a contract at one of these meetings.?The evening at the Horse and Groom was, in any event, a considerably less formal occasion than the senior management meetings, as there was no agenda or structure for the occasion and the conversation was largely social or general chat, rather than being specifically directed to any business subject.? Ashley was not in court to hear the judge deliver his ruling, but his lawyers said he had won a ?comprehensive? victory.In a statement, the businessman said: ?The only reason the Sports Direct share price exceeded £8, and will hopefully do so again, is because of the sterling efforts of all the people who work at Sports Direct.?Ashley, who gave evidence at the trial, said he could not recall making the alleged deal and if he had it would have been ?obviously just banter?.He had told the court that he had met Blue, who was then an adviser to Sports Direct, and three other finance specialists at the Horse & Groom pub and ?consumed a lot of alcohol?.?I can?t remember the details of the conversations that we had in the pub as it was a heavy night of drinking,? Ashley had said. ?I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. ?If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him £15m if he could increase [Sports Direct?s] share price to £8, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn?t being serious.? He said he paid Blue, whom he called ?Jeffers?, £1m for ?other deals? unrelated to the night in the Horse & Groom.Sports Direct?s shares hit the £8 price target in February 2014. The shares have since collapsed below £3, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed workers at the retailer?s Derbyshire warehouse were being paid less than the minimum wage.Shortly after the shares hit £8 at 1.04pm on 25 February 2014 Blue?s wife, who was also in court, texted him to say: ?It?s hit 8!!!!!?.Blue told the judge that Ashley was a ?serious businessman?. He said the work ethic at Sports Direct was ?like nothing else I have ever seen?, but he said Ashley sometimes did business ?in unorthodox ways and in unusual venues?.Blue claimed Ashley once vomited into a fireplace after a senior management meeting that was ?effectively a pub lock-in? and said the businessman would take naps under tables at ?boring? meetings.Lawyers told the judge that Ashley had run up legal bills of £1.5m, and Blue bills of ?£1m-odd?. The judge said Blue would have to pick up Ashley?s legal bills and £600,000 would have to be paid on account within the next month.Lawyers indicated that Blue had been ?assisted? by insurers in launching the litigation.",sports,3634,60,70
Women beat up molesters with slippers in Gurugram,"Not unfamiliar with late-hour spectacles, Gurgaon's Mall Mile, a one-km stretch dotted with shopping malls and night clubs, was witness to yet another eventful night on Saturday - albeit with a twist. A group of women pub workers, fed up with obscene gestures and physical assault by a few men, took out their slippers to teach their tormentors a lesson.The brawl was captured by several onlookers on their mobile phones and these clips are now in circulation on social media. The half-hour high drama makes a mockery of Gurugram Police's claims of night patrol at the stretch, which has been in news for open sex trade and crimes against women.MISSING POLICE PRESENCE""There was hardly any police presence on MG Road when this incident happened. Onlookers were busy shooting the fight on their cameras,"" BN Lal, an eye-witness and a resident of the area, told Mail Today. ""While sex deals taking place on the (MG) road are an open secret, police patrolling is seen only after a major crime is highlighted in the media. A few weeks later, it is business as usual,"" Lal added. Several eyewitnesses said the ""ugly episode"" took place around 1 AM when a group of four to five women, apparently working with the various pubs in the vicinity, were waiting outside Sahara Mall for transport. ""Some drunk men repeatedly made obscene gestures to the women and one of them approached them. This was followed by heated arguments and commotion, which made the men leave the spot,"" said one of the eyewitnesses, requesting anonymity.""However, these men, about a dozen in count, returned five-ten minutes later and again approached one of the younger women in the group,"" said the eyewitness. ""They must have been emboldened by the absence of any police patrol vehicle in the area.""Lal said a fresh round of arguments began after which one of the men tried to pull one of the women to where his vehicle was parked. The scuffle sparked anxiety among other women who rushed to help their colleague.SLIPPERS FLY""One of them took out his slipper and waved at the assailant. In a flash, all the women took off their footwear and began beating up the harasser. His friends came to help him but they also received the same treatment,"" Lal said. ""As a crowd gathered, the men ran away in their vehicles.""There are seven night clubs in Sahara Mall and each has the capacity of hosting about 100 guests. Local residents complain that at 1 AM, when these pubs down shutters, MG road gets crowded with groups of drunk men who are a nuisance. ""The situation is worst on weekends,"" said a resident.A security guard at the mall, who refused to be named, said when the patrons come out of these night clubs, they try to strike deals with women, some of whom are regular employees and others who facilitate entry to stag pub-goers. ""Such brawls usually occur when either a deal goes wrong or regular women employees are inappropriately approached. The Saturday incident seems to be the latter case,"" said the guard. ""When Gurgaon Police are around, there is little nuisance but when the patrol party is absent, such arguments are common. Only this time, the molesters were at the receiving end,"" the guard added.There are 15 night clubs in various malls on the stretch. Residents said they have approached the district administration but it has failed to come with an effective strategy to deal with the weekly ruckus. ""Pub owners must be held accountable for such incidents. They must ensure that female guests or staff leave their premises safely,"" said a local resident.City police tried to wash their hands of the matter by saying that such incidents were more of a social problem then a crime. Manish Sehgal, ACP (crime) of Gurugram Police said, ""We have deployed policemen and women in civil uniform to identify miscreants. There are regular drives to nab troublemakers.""Sehgal said the police are yet to receive any complaint in the case and will take appropriate action if they are approached by the victims.",general,3985,49,70

But before these young artists embarked on their pursuits, they not only studied Van Gogh?s artworks and techniques in detail but also read up on his life and struggle, which in itself is an inspiration for any budding artist.Jehaan Mehta?s artwork on display at the exhibition.The exhibition is a visual treat.

Trump's tweets reveal his creative personality: Study,"The Twitter messages of US President Donald Trump show that he is creative, competitive and a rule-breaker, but also has neurotic tendencies, a study has found.Since joining the social media platform Twitter in 2009 to May 2017, Trump has issued more than 35,000 messages.This amounts to about twelve tweets a day. With 30 million followers, he is the second most followed politician on Twitter after his predecessor, Barack Obama, who on average tweeted about four times a day.The researchers, Martin Obschonka from Queensland University of Technology in Australia, and Christian Fisch from Trier University in Germany analysed how aspects of Trump?s personality are revealed in the language he used in 3,200 tweets issued by October 2016, before he became president.They used established software for assessment of language and text for psychological purposes.Trump?s language use and online personality were also compared with that of 105 other famous business managers and entrepreneurs including Apple?s Tim Cook and Tesla?s Elon Musk who are not on the political stage.Their results indicate that Trump is indeed a distinct type of person who shows strong features of a so-called Schumpeterian personality that is said to be typical of successful entrepreneurs.This personality was described by Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s as being very creative, change-orientated, competitive and rule-breaking.The analysis further indicates that Trump has neurotic tendencies, and experiences underlying low well-being.?These traits are rather untypical for entrepreneurs since working as an entrepreneur may not only require emotional stability and optimism but also be able to increase happiness due to procedural utility,? said Obschonka.He added that neuroticism isn?t necessarily all bad, for it can also stimulate competitiveness.?Maybe this high neuroticism is a major motivator to succeed in Trump?s entrepreneurial projects in his business life, but also in his role as political leader,? said Fisch.?If social distinction is a core principle of the entrepreneurial personality, then we clearly see this principle reflected in his unusual personality profile,? said Fisch.?Many experts agree that really successful entrepreneurs not only dare to be different - they are different,? he said.The researchers speculate that having entrepreneurial personality traits could be advantageous in leading and governing an entrepreneurial society as a top-down process.However, they stress that leading a company is very different from leading a country and it is unclear whether political leaders with an extremely entrepreneurial personality can indeed act strictly entrepreneurially in their highly responsible role.The study was published in the journal Small Business Economics.",science,2778,53,70

As predicted by experts, the Lok Sabha rejected the amendments suggested by the upper house and passed the bill in its original form.Â The Lok Sabha introduced by Jaitley was strongly opposed by the opposition parties of RSP, TMC and BJD. The Opposition has termed the introduction of the amendments as ""back-door"" legislating and taking away right of Parliament to frame laws.Jaitley defended the amendments with the argument that they were all ""incidental provisions"" to the Finance Bill.

Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan had overruled the Opposition's objections, saying that rules permit ""non-taxation proposals"" to be included in the Finance Bill.

Naam Shabana banned a day after its release in Pakistan,"By now, we all know that Aamir Khan's Dangal will not have a Pakistan release due to their censor board's objection to scenes featuring the national flag and national anthem.

LeT co-founder urges jihadis to wage war in Northeast India,"After Kashmir, terror looms over Northeast. Banned terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is now provoking jihadis to wage war in the northeastern states of India. The malice intention of Lashkar came under the radar of security agencies through a video, where its cofounder Amir Hamza is seen instigating his cadre to spread violence in Northeast, including Darjeeling and Sikkim.A recent video, believed to be shot in Lahore on July 19, has left security agencies in a tizzy. Citing example of China military standoff with India over Doklam plateau, Hamza is asking jihadis to break up Indian states.""We will fight in Sikkim, we will fight in Bhutan, we will fight in Darjeeling, we will fight in Srinagar,"" Hamza can be heard saying in the video, which is in possession of Mail Today. Agencies have also authenticated the video clips. Recently, several terror activities came under the radar of security agencies from Northeast states but the fresh threat has raised alarms bells in the Home ministry.Senior officials claim Hamza was seen recently in Lahore and this was his first public appearance since JuD chief Hafiz Saeed's house arrest in January. Hamza, in the video, threatens to create violence in several states of the country. ""For one Bangladesh, we will take seven states,"" says Hamza.He has also praised China and talks about the dispute over the 40-km-long stretch between Doklam and Bangladesh border. This video is the first such proof of Lashkar-e-Taiba's direct involvement in the Northeast and their strategy to work along with China. ""if India will send its army in Bhutan to counter China, then along with Pakistan, Chinese troop will enter Srinagar,"" Hamza said in the video.Hamza was designated global terrorist by US in 2012 and is wanted by India for the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai that claimed over 160 lives and left more than 300 injured. He was detained by Pakistan authorities along with 26/11 key operative Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi soon after the attacks. He enjoys the position of number two in Lashkar ranks currently.In the video, Hamza, in his screeching voice, is also asking jihadis to fulfil Saeed's dream of Ghazwa-e-Hind (holy war to capture India). The Ghazwa-e-Hind is a saying some Islamic traditions attribute to Prophet Muhammad, prophesying that army arising from the West will seize India.

"Winning three Slams in a year would be a joke, says Federer","Roger Federer, who recently lifted his 19th Grand Slam champion at the age of 35 by winning a record eighth Wimbledon title, has insisted that it would be a joke if he wins third slam this year at the US Open.Federer has had a sparkling 2017, having emerged victorious in five tournaments including his fifth Australian Open title in January. The current world number three, who has returned to his menacing best, also holds a great chance to grab the US?Open for the sixth time.However, Federer refuses the possibility of accomplishing the same, saying, ?That would be a joke, if I won three slams this year out of nowhere. I know if I stay in shape, there are chances for me to do well at the US Open, but to win it? Yeah, at some stage I almost feel like I have to be realistic.??I am not 25 anymore. I?m not sure I can win three slams in one year. Winning two is already pretty crazy and plenty good enough for me,?

"JPMorgan made $26.5 bn over 12 months, record for a US bank","JP Morgan just had the most profitable 12 months ever for a US bank ? but it wasn?t enough for Jamie Dimon, the bank?s boss.?It?s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with in this country,? Dimon told journalists after the bank released its latest quarterly results on Friday.The world?s largest bank reported a profit of $7.03bn for the second quarter, 13% higher than last year. It has made $26.5bn over the past 12 months, a record profit for a US bank.But Dimon, who last year turned down Donald Trump?s offer to become treasury secretary, seemed more concerned about low rates of growth in the US and the health of the American body politic. He blamed bad policy for ?holding back and hurting the average American? and financial journalists for concentrating on the bank?s trading results when they should be focusing on policy.?Who cares about fixed-income trading in the last two weeks of June? I mean, seriously,? Dimon said after a reporter asked about the health of the bonds markets.?That is the weather,? he said of changes in the markets. ?It goes up and down, this and that, and that?s 80% of what you guys focus on.?Dimon said financial journalists would be better off concentrating on the ?bad policies? that are hurting average Americans.?It?s almost an embarrassment being an American traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit Americans have to deal with,? he said. ?At one point, we would have to get our act together, do what we?re supposed to do to the average American.?Dimon, who also heads the Business Roundtable lobbying group, which has been lobbying for tax reform and more infrastructure spending, set out policy areas he would like to see addressed.?We need infrastructure reform,? he said. ?We need corporate tax reform. We need better skills and education. If we don?t focus on these things, we are hurting average Americans every day.?The USA has to start to focus on policy which is good for all Americans, and that is regulation, tax, education, we have to get those things done. You guys [journalists] should be writing a lot more about that stuff. That is holding it back and hurting the average American citizen if we don?t do it. ?It?s not a Republican issue, it?s not a Democratic issue. Why you guys don?t write about it every day is totally beyond me.?I just got back from Israel, Ireland and France ? three countries that deeply recognise the importance of having a business tax scheme for jobs and wage growth. We don?t have that.?Dimon lamented US failure to build an airport in the last 10 years and the opiate addiction epidemic.The JP Morgan chief has become increasingly outspoken on political issues since the election. In his letter to shareholders, released in April, he took some subtle ? and some not so subtle ? swings at the Trump administration. While Dimon clearly favours cuts to regulation, he argued: ?Some regulations quite clearly create a common good (eg clean air and water).?Dimon?s letter was written as Trump began his attempts to dismantle Barack Obama?s legacy of environmental protections.Dimon also worried about the impact of ?poorly conceived anti-trade policies? and wrote that it was ?alarming? that so many talented immigrants were unable to stay in the US. ?We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here,? he wrote.The bank?s shares dipped slightly after the results were released but are still up close to 33% since the election of Trump.

The cash crunch has severely affected the sector and the loss was estimated to be about Rs 1,000 crore since the demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes came into effect from November 8 last, state Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told a press conference here. There was a decrease of 10-15 per cent in the number of foreign tourists arriving while the number of domestic tourists dipped by 20-30 per cent, he added.

He pointed out that the state netted a revenue of Rs 25,000 crore every year from the tourism sector. ""The currency crunch arose during the tourism season itself and so, things went wrong to a great extent,"" Surendran said, adding that foreign tourists were not getting enough cash at airports on their arrival.

Over 70% of Japan's biggest coral reef has died,"Almost three-quarters of Japan?s biggest coral reef has died, according to a report that blames its demise on rising sea temperatures caused by global warming.The Japanese environment ministry said that 70% of the Sekisei lagoon in Okinawa had been killed by a phenomenon known as bleaching.Bleaching occurs when unusually warm water causes coral to expel the algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white. Unless water temperatures quickly return to normal, the coral eventually dies from lack of nutrition.The plight of the reef, located in Japan?s southernmost reaches, has become ?extremely serious? in recent years, according to the ministry, whose survey of 35 locations in the lagoon last November and December found that 70.1% percent of the coral had died.The dead coral has now turned dark brown and is now covered with algae, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.The newspaper said the average sea surface temperature between last June and August in the southern part of the Okinawa island chain was 30.1 degrees centigrade ? or one to two degrees warmer than usual ? and the highest average temperature since records began in 1982, according to the Japan meteorological agency.The ministry report follows warnings by the Coral Reef Watch programme at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that global coral bleaching could become the ?new normal? due to warming oceans.Experts said that bleaching had spread to about 90% of the Sekisei reef, a popular diving spot that covers 400sq km.A similar survey conducted in September and October last year found that just over 56% of the reef had died, indicating that bleaching has spread rapidly in recent months.",world,1701,47,70

Time spent by Delhiites on roads has doubled in 6 yrs: Study,"The time spent by Delhiites on city roads has doubled in the last six years and the speed of traffic during peak hours has been cut by half, says a study by six top road design experts and engineers.Today, a person travelling a distance of 40 km by a private vehicle during peak hours spends an average of 3.43 hours on the road, as opposed to 1.36 hours in 2011. On the other hand, the average speed of a vehicle being driven during the evening peak hours ? between 5 pm and 7 pm ? has come down from 42 kmph to 20 kmph (without taking traffic signals and other stoppages into account).Experts say unless immediate steps are taken to unclog its roads, Delhi may find itself crawling at 5 kmph ? the average speed of a human walking ? in the next 10 years.Interactive | These maps show you how you are losing the race against Delhi?s trafficThe increase in Delhi?s vehicular population, which is forcing its road network to burst at the seams, has been squarely blamed for this phenomenon. The number of vehicles on city roads has grown from 74 lakhs to 89 lakhs in the last six years, a jump of almost 20%. A further two lakh vehicles enter the city from outside every day, adding to the congestion.The researchers, six Bhopal-based urban designers and road engineers hailing from premier institutes such as IIT Kharagpur, Delhi and BITS Pilani, will submit the study to the Delhi government next year. They will also provide suggestions on ways to improve urban infrastructure and encourage the use of public transport.The report has been sent to IIT Delhi for scrutiny by other transport experts.To arrive at these findings, the experts assessed the travel time and average speed of vehicles on five routes linking residential neighbourhoods with corporate hubs over the last six years. ?The idea was to focus on how the rise in number of vehicles was not only adding to pollution levels but also eating up travel time. To confirm our findings, we tracked the same routes over the last six years to see how the traffic has started dragging due to the addition of more vehicles,? said Prashant Raju, a road design expert from IIT Kharagpur.He said though the study is still in its primary stage, it exposes the manner in which people have exploited the city?s infrastructure. ?If something is not done soon, the traffic situation here will become similar to that of Dhaka ? where vehicles do not move any faster than 6 kmph during peak hours,? Raju cautioned.Other transport experts agreed that the national capital?s traffic situation was fast headed towards a point of no return. ?If you keep filling a jar that?s already filled to the brim, it will overflow. That?s precisely the state of Delhi roads. The focus should be on encouraging people to use public transport by making it comfortable and easily accessible,? said Dr S Velmurugan, senior principal scientist at Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Road Research Institute.Delhi?s traffic has doubled in the last eight years, Velmurugan added.",general,3022,60,70

Former Greece goalkeeper mentoring refugee football team,"Football fans of a certain age may still remember Antonis Nikopolidis for his resemblance to American actor George Clooney and as the goalkeeper who helped Greece become surprise European Champions in 2004.Now the country's national youth team coach, Nikopolidis is helping refugees stranded in Greece regain a sense of purpose. The football team he helped build, named Hope (Elpida in Greek), is made up of players who fled warzones in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan.Most of Hope's players live in Skaramangas, an industrial zone west of Athens where metal containers have been turned into shoebox-shaped homes. They compete in an amateur league on Sundays, facing teams made up of lawyers, telecom workers and accountants.Nikopolidis, a soft-spoken 46-year-old whose hair has turned silver in retirement, says team practices and matches provide a welcome distraction for young men facing uncertain futures in the European Union's slow-moving relocation program.""We're helping people who are at a difficult moment in their lives,"" he said.

IIT-Delhi faces shortage of rooms for its female students,"More women gaining admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) was a welcome news. But the institute in Delhi has no room for them, literally. Due to space crunch, several students have been asked to stay in an adjacent building meant for associate professors. According to a senior IIT official, due to 30% increase in number of women students for undergraduate and masters courses, there is severe shortage of accommodation. As a temporary measure, many have been accommodated in facilities meant for associate professors. Sources said a few angry parents complained to HRD minister Prakash Javadekar claiming that students were asked to sleep on the mattress spread on the floor as cots were unavailable. IIT officials said they have placed order for cots and 30-40 of them will be made available from Saturday.?We have accommodated all undergraduate students in the hostel. Around 100 masters students have been allotted rooms in the adjacent building. It is a temporary arrangement,? said a senior IIT official. Officials said even in 2016, a few students were asked to stay in temporary accommodation but were soon allotted hostels. The number is significantly high this year. ?Most of them have been given mattresses till cots are made available,? the official said. The existing hostels for post-graduate students in IIT-Delhi, Kailash and Himadri, can accommodate 900 students and are fully occupied now.?We had not anticipated such an increase but we have provided cots and almirahs to some students. We will provide them soon to the students who got only mattresses as of now. They will dine with students in the dining area in the hostel,? said the official.The IITs have registered a better representation of women this year ? from 8% in 2016 to 9.3 % in 2017. Through JEE advanced, a total of 70 girl students were admitted in IIT-Delhi for undergraduate courses in 2016 and it rose to 94 this year. There has also been a corresponding increase in MTech, MSc and PhD courses. ?Construction of our new hostel will begin by December. It will be able to accommodate at least 350-400 students and is expected to be completed in 18 months,? added the official. ?A status report will be sought from other IITs too,? he said.",general,2244,57,70

Girls to get lessons on menstruation at Delhi govt schools,"New Delhi, Feb 19 (PTI) FAQs about menstruation will now be answered at Delhi government schools with an NGO conducting ""period talks"" for teenage girls. In a campaign named ""Break the Bloody taboo"", NGO Sacchi Saheli which started with imparting these lessons in slums will now conduct sessions in 70 government-run schools. ""Usually lessons on menstruation are imparted to girls by their mothers who unfortunately also pass on superstition, stigma and fear surrounding the natural bodily process. ""There is an urgent need to educate young girls that menstruation is no disease and they need not be ashamed of it,"" said Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist, who has been roped into conduct these lessons.

Fishermen object to proposed 300-acre park in South Mumbai,"Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) readies its plan to build a 300-acre park in Cuffe Parade much like New York?s Central Park, it still faces stiff opposition from the city?s fishermen. The Akhil Maharashtra Machhimar Kriti Samiti has objected to the plans stating it would affect the livelihood of 20,000 fishermen. The BMC has proposed a 300-acre park to be built through reclamation in Cuffe Parade in the Development Plan (DP) 2034. The park would include a garden, playground and play area for children. Damodar Tandel, president of the association, said the fishermen use the area to park around 400 boats. The native Koli community is one of the early inhabitants of the city. The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) has also marked plots 139 to 142 in the area as machimaar nagar and 143-145 as parking space for boats in its regional plan, Tandel said. The fisherfolk have been opposing the state government?s proposal to erect Maratha warrior king Shivaji?s statue in the Arabian Sea and the BMC?s 29-km coastal road plan fearing the affect they will have on their livelihood. ?The BMC says it wants to increase green cover in the city by creating a theme park. Their plan is to destroy the sea by reclaiming to increase green cover? We have been carrying out fishing activities in this area for the past 40 years. This park will destroy our livelihoods,? Tandel said.The BMC is going to write to the MMRDA to jointly approach the Ministry of Environment for a green nod. The Backbay reclamation is special planning authority (SPA) zone that comes under the MMRDA. BMC officials also said they will make use of the muck generated out of the Metro-III project. Activists have also opposed the ambitious reclamation plan stating the need for more recreational spaces in the suburbs. The city?s past experiences with reclamation have changed sea levels and tidal currents and caused erosion of beaches.",general,1952,58,70

Amarnath Yatra attack mastermind to be Kashmir LeT chief,"Slain Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commander Abu Dujana will be replaced by Abu Ismail. Ismail will be the new Kashmir division chief of LeT after Dujana was killed by the security forces on Tuesday after a seven-hour gunfight in south Kashmir's Pulwama district. LeT commander Abu Ismail, a Pakistani national, was the mastermind of the deadly attack on Amarnath Yatra in which seven pilgrims, including six women, were killed and 19 were injured. Proactive operations have been launched, mainly in south Kashmir, to track down Ismail as investigations including communication intercepts have pointed out to his involvement in the attack on Amarnath pilgrims.Attack in Anantnag appears to be a reprisal for killing of several Lashkar militants including Bashir Lashkari in an encounter with security forces earlier this month.

Infosys is 1st India-registered firm to be listed on NASDAQ,"Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe.",business,3221,59,70
CBSE asked to install jammers to block porn sites in schools,"The government said in the Supreme Court on Friday that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been asked to explore the option of putting jammers to prevent students from accessing online child pornography in school.The court was hearing a petition seeking a directive to the government to block all websites hosting pornographic content.Additional solicitor general Pinky Anand said that 3,522 sites were blocked in June, but ruled out installing jammers in school buses as part of steps to prevent youngsters from being abused sexually on the internet.?It?s not possible to have jammers in buses, but to install them inside school premise is under consideration. The CBSE has been instructed to take up the issue with school managements,? Anand said.The CBSE is the country?s top school board and more than 10,000 institutions are affiliated to it.Most schools teach computers and the internet has become part of the curriculum, enhancing knowledge as well as putting the students at risk of being sexually exploited online. Children in school buses accessing porn on mobile phones remain a grey area.There is no accurate data on the number of Indian children being exploited in pornographic material as many victims do not go to police because of fear and shame. There were 96 reports of children being sexually exploited online in 2015, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data.The government told a three-judge bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra that it will take steps to deal with the ?situation in its entirety?.It said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) shares an Interpol list on online child sexual abuse material with the government, which then orders internet service providers to block these sites. This list is updated regularly.India doesn?t have a centralised mechanism to monitor websites containing child porn. A government committee has suggested that internet service providers should disable such sites until the monitoring system is created.Besides, the service providers were asked to spread awareness among subscribers about the use of parental control filters in their machines.",general,2134,60,70
IT firms should manage employee expectations: Ex-Infosys CEO,"Hyderabad, Jul 25 (PTI) As growth rate slows down, Indian IT companies need to learn to manage expectations of their employees, says a senior industry figure as he pitched for retraining of staff, in the era of rapid technology transition. When growth rate slows down, one has to manage the expectations of the employees within the company, former CEO of Bengaluru-headquartered IT major, Infosys, Kris Gopalakrishnan said. ""The number of promotions will come down because there are no openings at higher levels. So, you have to set expectations properly"", he told PTI. Secondly, the former President of Confederation of Indian Industry said, technology is transitioning and, so, employees will have to be retrained. ""One, the company must invest in retraining employees, and two, employees must invest time in learning. So, these are stressful situations for both employees as well as leadership in the companies"", Gopalakrishnan said. Last month, Indian IT industry body NASSCOM projected software export growth in 2017-18 at 7-8 per cent in constant currency, down from 8.6 per cent in the previous fiscal. The industry would add 130,000-150,000 jobs in the current financial year, it had forecast. Gopalakrishnan, the Chairman of Axilor Ventures, an early stage startup accelerator and venture fund, rejected suggestions that there is job-crisis in the Indian IT sector. ""Even NASSCOM has projected this sector will add one lakh-plus jobs this year also. Yes, growth rate has come down, recruitment numbers are lower but its still positive and the industry is still recruiting people"", he said. Gopalakrishnan, however, said hiring is slowing down because growth rate has come down. ""There have been some impact of automation on certain services. For example, infrastructure management services, maintenance services where automation has had an impact. Several tasks can be automated and those services will require less number of people. ""Now these are services where the work is actually quite repetitive and in the long run, these tasks are better done by machines because they are repetitive"", he said. Gopalakrishnan also shared his thoughts on opportunities and challenges for the industry in the coming decade, a period he said would be exciting for the sector as every industry is transitioning, and IT companies need to be ""reimaginative"" in helping such industries in the process.",general,2395,60,70

Eid release of Salman's Tubelight being opposed in Pakistan,"Karachi, Apr 30 (PTI) Bollywood superstar Salman Khans much awaited film ""Tubelight"" might not hit the screens on Eid in Pakistan as some local filmmakers have started a movement to stall the release of the film. The filmmakers along with the Film Distributors Association and the Film Producers Association want to ensure better business for Pakistani films during the Eid holidays. The distributors, producers and filmmakers say they want to protect the interest of Pakistani movies as two big films, ""Yalghaar"" and ""Shor Sharaba"", along with others in the pipeline, are slated for an Eid release. ""If Tubelight also releases on Eid, it will certainly hit the business of these Pakistani films and that will not help our industry,"" actor Mustafa Qureshi said.

RBI?refuses to deposit ?200 cr in old notes from Maharashtra,"Even as the window to deposit scrapped notes in the Reserve Bank of India closed on Thursday, 31 district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) in Maharashtra were still left with around Rs200 crore in old currency.

It is discriminatory that when the scheduled, centralized, urban banks were allowed to deposit their notes collected before demonetisation, only DCCBs were singled out.

Ex-BCCI Prez Thakur issues 'unconditional apology' to SC,"Former BCCI president Anurag Thakur on Thursday tendered a fresh ?unconditional? and ?unequivocal? apology in the Supreme Court, saying it was never his intention to undermine the majesty of the apex court.Thakur, a senior BJP leader and a Member of Parliament from Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh, was asked by the apex court on July 7 to tender an apology in explicit terms to get relief from the contempt proceedings initiated against him.?I humbly submit that it was never the intention of the deponent to undermine the majesty of this court and since unintentionally some kind of misinformation and miscommunication has occured, I unhesitatingly tender my unconditional and unequivocal apology to this court,? he said in his affidavit filed.

Indian once performed 833 eye surgeries in 14 hours,"What Mother Teresa is to Calcutta's dying destitutes, Dr Murugappa Chennaveerappa Modi, 72. is to the poor blind villagers of Karnataka. For 45 years. Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. The operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. Modi. Kannukota anna (the brother who gives vision) to the local people, has performed as many as 5.79 lakh eye operations so far. And his labour has always been free.For Modi, his mission is spiritual. ""I see myself as a poojary. The patient is my god, every village is my place of pilgrimage, the operating table is my shrine and my instruments are the accessories of worship,"" says the sprightly surgeon who lives a spartan existence. Born of humble parentage - a Kannadiga from Bijapur district - Modi threw away a lucrative career in private practice after attending Gandhiji's historic prayer meeting at Bombay on August 8, 1942 where the Quit India resolution was passed. That meeting changed his life. And Modi, the gifted ophthalmologist, dedicated his life to the sightless.""I felt affected when I saw blind people begging. They just did not have money to go to doctors."" Modi recalled.And those who had the money had often sold their jewellery or livestock to put it together for the treatment. This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. Ambidextrous, he performs delicate eye surgeries with his left hand. He does cataract operations, squint corrections and cornea transplants. Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in his camps. But now in Karnataka, he operates on 200 to 300 patients every day.His phenomenal contributions for the sightless have not gone unappreciated. Recognition has come to him through the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan. Hellen Keller, the blind and deaf-mute American author, who attended one of his camps in 1954 asked Modi: ""Have you insured your hands?"" In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people. ""Villagers used to ask me if I was that good, why was I operating for tree? Modi reminisced.",general,2522,51,70

Dutt biopic not propaganda to portray him as God: Ranbir,"Ranbir Kapoor says the upcoming biopic on Sanjay Dutt will deal with both the highs and lows of the actor?s life.Ranbir says Dutt has been very gracious in providing insights about his life story in an honest way for the biopic being helmed by Rajkumar Hirani.?He hasn?t been a hypocrite about it (his life). So it?s not a propaganda film trying to portray him as God or something.?We are trying to show a very human side of Sanjay Dutt, his perils, his downfall, his will to fight, his time in jail, terrorism charges, his drug phase, how he handled his mother?s death two days before the release of his debut film, his relationship with his father. These were human conflicts in his life,? Ranbir told PTI.Ranbir, who plays Dutt in the movie, says doing the biopic was daunting initially.?He is such a relevant person even today. He is so much loved even today. He is controversial. But when you have Rajkumar Hirani as the director and Abhijat Joshi as the writer and the character like Sanjay Dutt, you are somewhere cushioned,? he says.Ranbir Kapoor at a cinema hall in Mumbai on July 14, 2017. (IANS) From getting into the skin of the character to getting the body language right, the Jagga Jasoos star had to put in a lot of hard work to get every aspect of Dutt correct.?Getting the look right is very superficial, it is easy as you have help from make-up and computer graphics. To show Sanjay Dutt as a human being, as a biopic only works when you show the human side of a person, and not the glories but the downfall as well (was not easy).?Though Ranbir seems to have got the look right, he is extremely nervous about the film.?I don?t know if I have nailed it or not (referring to the film). I was very inspired (doing this film). We have a few days left now for the film. It?s a very new me, so I am excited to see how the audience reacts. It should be out on March 30 next year,? he says.There were rumours that the Khalnayak track will be recreated in the biopic but Ranbir says that?s not true.?We have not touched upon the Khalnayak phase. This film doesn?t talk about Sanjay Dutt the hero, but Sanjay Dutt?s life. We have touched upon his few films like the first one Rocky, Munnabhai MBBSs,? he says.The film also features Manisha Koirala as late Nargis Dutt, Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt and Dia Mirza as Dutt?s present wife Manyata.

They targeted him in Australia and he came back and played superbly. For me it was the life changing series for Kohli and since then he's been a terrific player.

Dressing like men causes PCOS: College principal tells girls,"Eve-teasing, molestation and rape are sensitive issues in our nation but the way 'authorities' handle these issues is appalling sometimes. From orthodox thinking to the way a woman is dressed up, all kinds of unnecessary reasons are given as causes. Nonetheless, actions must be taken to prevent these shameful acts and that is exactly what a Mumbai college wanted to do, not. A list of do's and don'ts was released by a Mumbai college recently and apart from shocking everyone, it has invited mockery at a large scale.Government Polytechnic College in Bandra has finally found a way to avoid eve-teasing by separating the seating areas of girls and boys in the canteen area and slapping a dress code on the girls studying in the college.

Thanks to them, we now know which classic cars the 'King of Good Times' Vijay Mallya, might have in his garage.However, the authenticity of this list cannot be verified. Let's take a look at 6 of these classic cars and how much they cost1. 1990 Lamborghini CountachLamborghini produced only 658 units of the Countach's to mark its 25th Anniversary in 1988.

New device allows creating music with thoughts,"A newly-developed hands-free musical instrument that now allows people to make music with their minds is bringing a new meaning to ?straight off the dome.? Researchers hope that this new instrument will help empower and rehabilitate patients with motor disabilities such as those from stroke, spinal cord injury or amputation.?The Encephalophone is a musical instrument that you control with your thoughts,? explained first author Thomas Deuel from the University of Washington. ?I am a musician and neurologist, and I?ve seen many patients with motor impairment, who can no longer play an instrument or sing,? said Deuel. ?I thought it would be great to use a brain-computer instrument to enable patients to play music again without requiring movement.?Deuel originally developed the Encephalophone (patent pending) in his own independent laboratory, in collaboration with Felix Darvas, a physicist at the University of Washington. The Encephalophone can be controlled via two independent types of brain signals: either those associated with the visual cortex (ie closing one?s eyes), or those associated with thinking about movementThe Encephalophone is based on brain-computer interfaces using an old method, called electroencephalography, which measures electrical signals in the brain. Scientists first began converting these signals into sounds in the 1930s and, later, into music in the 1960s. But these methods were still difficult to control and were not easily accessible to non-specialist users.Follow @htlifeandstyle for more.",lifestyle,1540,46,70

BJP can fight war with Pak to win 2019 polls: Digvijaya,"Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today launched another tirade against the BJP Government. Casting grave doubts on the intention of the Modi dispensation, Singh mentioned there is an attempt to build an atmosphere in the direction of war with Pakistan. ""BJP government is not fulfilling the promises it made to the people. So, there is no alternative left in the country to win the election. So, in this situation, Modi government can fight a war with Pakistan. This kind of an atmosphere is being built to win the 2019 elections."", Digvijaya Singh stated.

Amsterdam café gives discounts in return for plastic wastes,"Located just behind Amsterdam Centraal station with views looking out across the river IJ, Al Ponte is a popular cafe serving a constant stream of commuters on their way to and from the nearby ferry port. Not all Al Ponte?s customers pay for their coffees, however. Not in the traditional sense anyway.Al Ponte is one of the businesses participating in Wasted, a pilot project running in Amsterdam?s Noord district which incentivises households to recycle their plastics by rewarding them with discounts at local businesses.When prospective participants sign up they are given bags labelled with unique QR codes, enabling the scheme?s organisers to apportion the correct credit to each household once the filled bags have been collected. For every bag of plastics they produce households earn one green coin. At present the coins are sent to users in the post, although next year Wasted?s organisers want to develop the scheme?s digital currency. As well as reducing bureaucracy, this will enable them to engage online businesses in offering rewardsAt Al Ponte, one coin earns users a free second coffee. Meanwhile, over at BeekhovenBikes Fietsspecialist?s cycle shop three coins earn users 50% off tyre repairs. Discounts on accountancy support, groceries and reiki treatments are also included in the list of rewards offered by the 30 or so participating retailers.Silvia Salani, who owns Al Ponte, says there are days when only one or two customers have a coin to exchange and others when that number reaches double figures. As well as improving her standing in the community, Salani believes being part of the scheme has been positive for business growth as she sees those who first came in with friends for free coffees returning as paid customers.Since Wasted was set up in early 2015 by Dutch non-profit the Cities Foundation, more than 700 households have signed up. In a previous iteration of the project, staff from the Cities Foundation collected the plastics from users? homes and fed them into the municipal recycling scheme. As the project has scaled, however, the city council, which subsidises the project, has taken over the weekly collection.The city council doesn?t normally offer domestic collection of recyclables, instead providing Noord?s 87,000 residents with on-street containers. With Wasted, however, it has said is keen to support the Cities Foundation?s goal to connect waste management with supporting local entrepreneurs.In a recent survey of Wasted users, 52% of respondents said they had improved their waste disposal habits as a result of using Wasted and 23% said they had reduced their total plastics consumption. ?People start to realise how much plastic they produce on a weekly basis and it is pretty distressing,? says Francesca Miazzo, founder of the Cities Foundation.Broader research to date suggests schemes that reward residents to recycle have mixed long-term results. A study carried out by independent consultancy Eunomia, commissioned by Serco, shows such initiatives have ?highly variable? results.?Unfortunately there?s no real indication that reward schemes outperform simply publicising pre-existing recycling scheme information,? says Peter Jones, a principal consultant at Eunomia. While Miazzo acknowledges the long-term challenge, she believes activating community participation and creating awareness can help sustain positive behaviour: ?We want to engage those who don?t usually care about recycling, while building a social contract between the community and business owners that goes beyond the traditional consumer relationship,? she says.

Jolie denies report of using cruel casting process for kids,"Angelina Jolie says accounts of her casting process for children to appear in her film First They Killed My Father are false and upsetting. An excerpt from a Vanity Fair profile of the director sparked backlash online earlier this week from people who criticized the methods as being cruel and exploitative.Adapted from Loung Ung?s memoir, the biographical drama centres on her childhood under the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Jolie co-wrote and directed the film, which she talked about in a recent Vanity Fair profile.The article described a scene in which casting directors in their attempt to find a child actor to play the lead role presented money to impoverished children only to take it away from them as an acting exercise.Jolie and producer Rithy Panh issued joint statements Sunday responding to the outrage and refuting claims that the production was exploitative through a representative from Netflix, which is producing and distributing the film.?I am upset that a pretend exercise in an improvisation, from an actual scene in the film, has been written about as if it was a real scenario. The suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting,? Jolie said. ?I would be outraged myself if this had happened.?Jolie said parents, guardians and doctors were on set daily to care for the children and ?make sure that no one was in any way hurt by participating in the recreation of such a painful part of their country?s history.?Panh, who himself is a survivor of the Khmer Rouge, added that casting ?was done in the most sensitive way possible?.He described a process that was informed both by families? preferences and NGO (non-governmental organization) guidelines in which the children understood that they would be acting out a scene.The Vanity Fair article described a scene in which casting directors in their attempt to find a child actor to play the lead role presented money to impoverished children only to take it away from them as an acting exercise. (AFP) ?The children were not tricked or entrapped, as some have suggested,? Panh said. ?They understood very well that this was acting, and make believe.?The Vanity Fair article went into more detail about the production than the one paragraph that circulated on Twitter, which sparked the initial outrage.A representative from Vanity Fair issued a statement Sunday saying that author Evgenia Peretz ?clearly describes what happened during the casting process as a ?game?? and ?that the filmmakers went to extraordinary lengths to be sensitive in addressing the psychological stresses on the cast and crew that were inevitable in making a movie about the genocide carried out in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge.?Jolie?s film will debut on Netflix sometime after showing at the Toronto International Film Festival this September.Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,2892,59,70

The principal went on to say that the parents of the children studying there had not raised an issue until the alleged photo went viral.Parents-Teachers Association president Sabu Cyraic said that there was no problem with the uniform and no parent had objected to it. Rather the uniform was based on a booklet that showed designs for uniforms. ""Obscenity lies in the eyes of the beholder,"" Cyraic said.",general,1867,56,70

No. of visitors at peafowl sanctuary up after Raj HC remark,"Days after a Rajasthan High Court judge said that peacocks do not have sex and peahens get pregnant by drinking the tears of peacocks, the number of visitors at Choolannur sanctuary in Palakkad, Kerala, has gone up.People are queuing up at the Choolannur pea fowl sanctuary to see if and how tears of peacocks can impregnate peahens.Since Rajasthan High Court judge Mahesh Chandra Sharma made the startling comment on May 31 and set the social media on fire, the sanctuary in Palakkad has witnessed the average number of daily visitors going up from a measly 10-12 to 200-300 in the last fortnight.SHOWING VISITORS THE REAL PICTUREThe authorities at the Palakkad sanctuary, however, have taken it upon themselves to educate people about the mating habits of peacocks and show them the 'real' picture.Officials at the sanctuary show videos on mating pattern of peacocks to inquisitive visitors and tell them that unlike what the Rajasthan High Court judge said, peacocks mate just like any other bird.Forester T G Babu explains to visitors how exactly do peacocks mate with peahens: ""The peacocks spread their feathers and strut around the peahen.

A change.org petition has been created against 'Piano Man' demanding shutting down of the ""casteist jazz club for its hate crimes against Dalits"".""Bhangi is a scheduled caste community forced into manual scavenging and sweeping work in India.

Arjun's first Facebook post on the issue came on June 3 where he said, ""There is a gap between the artist's understanding of the word and that of some people who have reacted very negatively. I can assure you that neither the artist (who is an extremely polite and respectful person) nor The Piano Man wanted to hurt anyone, and for that, we apologise. That said, we are vehement supporters of artistic freedom and will continue to be...always.""The artist, after he learned about the fact that the name of his band could be misinterpreted and misunderstood by people, changed it to Akshay Kapoor. Talking to IndiaToday.in, Arjun said, ""It is true that we were ignorant of the fact that the word is used as a casteist slur, and I can assure you that it wasn't the artist's or The Piano Man's intent to hurt any community. It is quite sad to see that people are being oblivious to the fact that the band's name has already been changed. The Piano Man has always been an inclusive space focused on spreading love, not hatred in any form.""

This was announced by Arjun in another Facebook post he made on June 4 where he said, ""I think I failed to understand how deeply this has affected some people.""

Bank data of 1 cr Indians was up for sale for 20 paise each,"Delhi Police on Thursday said they had arrested a man who they claimed was in possession of the personal bank details of nearly 1 crore Indians.The accused, identified as 33-year-old Puran Gupta, would allegedly sell this data to fake call centres whose employees would in turn use it to call the targeted victims and obtain their one-time passwords (OTPs). Since the fake call centres already had other details related to the credit or debit cards, courtesy Gupta, the OTPs would help them in stealing money.Gupta was arrested from Ganesh Nagar on Monday after the southeast Delhi police began probing a complaint in which a senior citizen from Greater Kailash was duped of Rs 1.46 lakh by a caller who posed as a representative of Citibank and tricked him into revealing his OTP.?Much of the money stolen was transferred to e-wallets and online ewallets such as PayU, Paytm, Olacabs, Mobikwik and Vodafone Bill Pay,? said Romil Baaniya, DCP (southeast). Since the victim was quick to approach the police, the investigators immediately shot off letters to some of these firms. ?Our prompt action led to these firms returning almost Rs 72,000 of the duped amount,? said Baaniya. The police had earlier this month also arrested the owner of a fake call centre, Ashish Kumar Jha, who also used to trick senior citizens and duped their money. When questioned how he had obtained the victim?s credit card details and contact number, he named Gupta.That opened a can of worms. Once Gupta was arrested, a search of his laptop and emails revealed that he was in possession of the personal banking data of nearly one crore Indians. He had stored the data in different folders to meet the exact requirement of his clients.Some of these classifications were based on the age groups, monthly incomes and credit card limits, police said. ?The fake call centres found women and elderly people easy targets,? explained Baaniya as the reason for classification of the data.Apart from the credit and debit card details, Gupta was also found to be in possession of personal data of Delhi University students, lawyers, stock brokers, people interested in night life and those owning cars. He allegedly sold these data for as little as 10 paise per data.But the hot property was the credit and debit card details of people. Police are probing if employees of some banks helped him procure the data. ?He was buying the credit and debit card data for 40 paise per customer. Apart from the card numbers, expiry dates and CVVs, he was able to procure all details filled in the application forms by customers,? said another investigator.A former data entry operator, Gupta, had created a firm that appeared to be involved in data collection, data entry, data market research and online promotion.

EC clears Manish Sisodia in 'office of profit' case,"The election commission (EC) has cleared Delhi?s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and party colleague Surinder Singh of allegations of holding an office of profit, a charge that could have disqualified them as legislators. The complaint against Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party MLA Singh was forwarded to the poll panel by the president?s office but was found to be untenable, sources said.The poll panel?s findings have been sent to President Pranab Mukherjee?s office . Sources said the President has to accept the EC?s recommendations.The decision comes at a time when the election commission is hearing a similar complaint against 21 AAP legislators, who were appointed parliamentary secretaries to assist various ministers of the Arvind Kejriwal government. The appointments were struck down by the Delhi high court.The poll panel?s decision, which can have a bearing on the stability of the government, is likely to be announced by May 15.BJP leader Vivek Garg wrote to Mukherjee, demanding Sisodia?s membership of the Delhi assembly be cancelled as there was no provision for the post of deputy chief minister in the NCT of Delhi act, which deals with government formation, assembly and other such subjects. Sisodia?s appointment amounted to holding an office of profit, Garg had said. Members of Parliament and state assemblies can?t accept government positions that offer money or other benefit such as office space or even a car. A violation can lead to the disqualification of a lawmaker under the ?office of profit? rules that are meant to ensure independence of legislature and guard legislators from executive?s inducements.Singh was accused of benefitting from his membership of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation by illegally occupying four government flats.Delhi?s ruling party has been at loggerheads with the poll panel. Stung by a series of poll defeats, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and several colleagues have raised doubts over the electronic voting machine, alleging EVMs were tampered with to benefit the BJP.Kejriwal even questioned impartiality of election commissioners OP Rawat and AK Joti.

Rabbit set to be world's biggest dies on United flight,"London, Apr 26 (PTI) A giant rabbit, destined to be the worlds biggest bunny, died mysteriously on a United Airlines flight to the US, the latest in a slew of public relations nightmares faced by the beleaguered American airline recently. Three-foot Simon died in the cargo section of a Boeing 767 after flying out of Heathrow to a new celebrity owner in the US, The Sun reported.

Qatar complaints to WTO against Saudi-led trade boycott,"Qatar filed a wide-ranging legal complaint at the World Trade Organization on Monday to challenge a trade boycott by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates, the director of Qatar?s WTO office Ali Alwaleed al-Thani told Reuters.By formally ?requesting consultations? with the three countries, the first step in a trade dispute, Qatar triggered a 60 day deadline for them to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO and potential retaliatory trade sanctions.?We?ve given sufficient time to hear the legal explanations on how these measures are in compliance with their commitments, to no satisfactory result,? al-Thani said.?We have always called for dialogue, for negotiations, and this is part of our strategy to talk to the members concerned and to gain more information on these measures, the legality of these measures, and to find a solution to resolve the dispute.?The boycotting states cut ties with Qatar - a major global gas supplier and host to the biggest US military base in the Middle East - on June 5, accusing it of financing militant groups in Syria, and allying with Iran, their regional foe, allegations Doha denies.The boycotting countries have previously told the WTO that they would cite national security to justify their actions against Qatar, using a controversial and almost unprecedented exemption allowed under the WTO rules.They said on Sunday they were ready for talks to tackle the dispute, the worst rift between Gulf Arab states in years, if Doha showed willingness to deal with their demands.The text of Qatar?s WTO complaint cites ?coercive attempts at economic isolation? and spells out how they are impeding Qatar?s rights in the trade in goods, trade in services and intellectual property.The complaints against Saudi Arabia and the UAE run to eight pages each, while the document on Bahrain is six pages.There was no immediate reaction from the three to Qatar?s complaint, which is likely to be circulated at the WTO later this week.?REMAIN HOPEFUL?The disputed trade restrictions include bans on trade through Qatar?s ports and travel by Qatari citizens, blockages of Qatari digital services and websites, closure of maritime borders and prohibition of flights operated by Qatari aircraft.The complaint does not put a value on the trade boycott, and al-Thani declined to estimate how much Qatar could seek in sanctions if the litigation ever reached that stage, which can take 2-5 years or longer in the WTO system.?We remain hopeful that the consultations could bear fruit in resolving this,? he said.The WTO suit does not include Egypt, the fourth country involved in the boycott. Although it has also cut travel and diplomatic ties with Qatar, Egypt did not expel Qatari citizens or ask Egyptians to leave Qatar.Al-Thani declined to explain why Egypt was not included.?Obviously all options are available. But we have not raised a consultation request with Egypt yet,? he said.In its WTO case, Qatar would also draw attention to the impact the boycott was having on other WTO members, he added.Many trade diplomats say that using national security as a defence risks weakening the WTO by removing a taboo that could enable countries to escape international trade obligations.Al-Thani said governments had wide discretion to invoke the national security defence but it had to be subject to oversight.?If it is self-regulating, that is a danger to the entire multilateral trading system itself. And we believe the WTO will take that into consideration.?Qatar also raised the boycott at a meeting of the United Nations? International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on Monday, al-Thani said.In comments to Qatar-based Al Jazeera television later on Monday, Qatar?s transport and information minister said the boycotting countries had discriminated against Doha in violation of an international agreement guaranteeing overflights.?These countries have used this right arbitrarily and imposed it on aircraft registered only in the State of Qatar,? Jassim bin Saif al-Sulaiti said.Qatar in June asked Montreal-based ICAO to resolve the conflict, using a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, a 1944 treaty that created the agency and set basic rules for international aviation.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain said on Sunday they would allow Qatari planes to use air corridors in emergencies.",world,4392,55,70

Nobody is anyone's father or son: Latif after Ind-Pak final,"Rashid Latif has extended a hand of friendship towards Virender Sehwag after his tirade on social media created a storm in India. In the course of the Champions Trophy, Latif had used derogatory language over Sehwag's witty remarks on social media. The former Pakistan wicketkeeper's choice of vocabulary had left much to be desired and his verbal onslaught left observers stunned. While Sehwag had chosen to maintain a dignified silence, India cricketer Manoj Tiwary posted a video with a like-for-like response to Latif. India had defeated Pakistan in their Champions Trophy opener on June 4 and there was the usual social media banter between supporters of the two teams. Sometimes the banter tends to get a little overboard as emotions run high. However, Pakistan came back strongly from their dismal start to first storm into the final and then defeating India, the pre-tournament favourites.

""I can't get in the team myself. Gavaskar was a wonderful player and friend. Can I pick him ahead of Grace and Hobbs? Grace's numbers would look rubbish with 30 something. But you can't compare with today where wickets are wonderfully prepared. Back then, pitches were full of stones. They would have to wait till 2 pm to make the pitch dry. Today they would get mad if they are given wet wickets,"" he explained. Having chosen legends WG Grace and Sir Jack Hobbs as his openers, Boycott went on to pick Sir Donald Bradman and West Indian George Headley. Many of Boycott's choices were those of yesteryears as the greater degree of challenges they faced than the batsmen of today. ""George Headley may have played only 20 something games but they called him 'the black Bradman'. He played at a time when West Indies were not doing well,"" he said.""You have to look at the relativity of the players of that era. Look at Bradman he was twice as good as me,"" he opined.

It adopted the definition of the Palermo Protocol of the UN, which prevents trafficking in persons.

His music is without boundaries. Our culture is flexible and convergent.""The minister compared Indian culture to the voices of Kabir and Maharishi Charvaka- known for their anti-norm views. Some people are trying to enforce uniformity is the garb of unity, he said. ""India with such diverse culture is a culture of resistance and we should celebrate it.""The Aam Aadmi Party and other critics have accused the ruling BJP at the Centre as well as affiliated groups of trying to muzzle dissent and paint nonconformists as ""anti-nationals"".ON RAMJAS, JNU INCIDENTSTalking about clashes at educational institutions in recent months including the violence at Delhi's Ramjas College in February and JNU last year, Mishra said university culture is all about healthy discussion on politics and policies.""It is wrong to term the voices of dissent as Naxalite, terrorist or anarchist. However, the anti national slogans that were raised in JNU are unacceptable and people responsible for it should be behind bars,"" he said. ""But hitting a college professor in the name of culture is not a trait of a Hindu.""The Capital will hold cultural and tourism festivals in six months on the lines of Dubai and Singapore, the minister announced.""We are working on the packaging and the branding of the Capital,"" he said. ""We are introducing seven tourist circuits. We have collaborated with INTACT to protect 250 archeological sites in the Capital."" MISHRA APPRECIATES CENTRE'S SUPPORTAmid all the criticism for the Centre, the minister did not hold back in appreciating the support he received from the Modi government.""The Centre and Delhi government are closely working in tandem to promote tourism and clean the Yamuna,"" he said.""We believe, to promote culture it is important to connect the society with the river. Therefore, we organised a mega Yamuna aarti and are also going to develop river tourism and a `200-crore budget has been earmarked for this year. We have a 22-km stretch of clean water which is still an unexplored point. We have begun water sports. We will develop a 5-km ecological river front.""The city's nightlife is an important part of the culture and it's beyond going to India Gate or nightclubs, Mishra argued.

Freedom 251 maker's Director Mohit Goel detained for fraud,"Police has detained Mohit Goel, the director of Ringing Bells, the company behind's last year Freedom 251 phone for alleged fraud. Goel was held after Ghaziabad-based Ayam Enterprises filed an FIR on Wednesday alleging that Ringing Bells ""defrauded"" it of Rs 16 lakh.Last year Ringing Bells had created a sensation after it announced Freedom 251, a smartphone that it promised to sell at a price of Rs 251. The company took pre-orders from hundreds of thousands of people. However, so far it has failed to deliver the phones to most of these people who had pre-booked the device.Ghaziabad deputy SP Manish Mishra said Goel has been detained for interrogation in the matter.In the FIR, Ayam Enterprises has claimed it was persuaded by Goel and others from Ringing Bells to take up the distributorship of the Freedom 251 phones in November 2015.""We paid Rs 30 lakh to Ringing Bells through RTGS on different occasions. But it delivered us product worth Rs 13 lakh only. Upon follow-up, we could get products plus money totalling Rs 14 lakh,"" it claimed in the FIR.The owners of Ayam Enterprises claim that they were threatened with life if they asked for the rest Rs 16 lakh ""again and again"".The Freedom 251 looked like a scam since very beginning. The phone was seemingly a re-branded Chinese phone that was picked up at a price of a few thousand rupees from Chinese market. However, these units were just the display units. Ringing Bells never showed that it had the ability to manufacture or even import hundreds of thousands of phones to supply them to all those people who pre-booked it.",technology,1591,58,70

Control of AirAsia India to remain with Indians: Govt to HC,"New Delhi, Feb 23 (PTI) The ownership and control of AirAsia India would remain with Indian nationals under its Brand Licensing Agreement (BLA) with its parent company, Malaysias AirAsia Berhad, aviation regulator DGCA said today. The submission by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) before the Delhi High Court was made in response to the allegation of the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA) that as per the BLA, the ownership and control of the airline was with the foreign entity. On FIAs plea, the court had on November 11 last year asked DGCA to peruse the BLA between AirAsia India and AirAsia Berhad to determine who controls the low-cost carrier. The DGCA report said ""based on the review of BLA along with provisions of Aircraft Rules 1937 and definition of control as provided in FDI policy, I do not find that the terms and conditions laid down in BLA dilute the substantial ownership and effective control of AirAsia India vested with Indian nationals."" It also said that the ""status of issuance of air operator permit (or flying licence) to AirAsia India does not change"". Meanwhile, AirAsia India opposed BJP leader Subramanian Swamys application to make R Venkataramanan, Managing Trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and a member of the Board of AirAsia India Pvt Ltd, a party in the case. Swamy has sought impleadment of Venkataramanan on the basis of a letter of Cyrus Mistry, ex-Chairman of Tata Sons, that there was an alleged fraudulent transaction of Rs 22 crore in connection with the setting up of AirAsia India.

The 38-year-old Pacquiao had said four days ago that he and Khan?s management were in discussions for the fight, despite an earlier announcement the Filipino?s next bout would be against Jeff Horn. Pacquiao, however, had said that Horn was one of many possible opponents.

The 30-year-old Khan, who won silver as a lightweight at the Athens Olympics, has not fought since last May when he moved up two weight classes to fight middleweight Canelo Álvarez.The much bigger Mexican proved too powerful and the Briton was knocked out in the sixth round and he is likely to drop back to welterweight to fight Pacquiao, who holds the World Boxing Organisation title at the weight. ?My team and I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight,?

Manish and I never really got divorced on paper: Pooja Bhatt,"For the recent HTBrunch interview, we caught up with Pooja Bhatt at her sprawling farmhouse in Kalote, 2 kms off Old Mumbai - Pune highway. The farmhouse is perched amid lush greenery surrounded by the Western Ghaat range, there is also a waterfall inside the property we were later told!A nondescript iron gate that greets us with a humble ?beware of dogs? sign and as we enter, we spot six of them playing with balding guy in blue Tee-shirt and military green cargo pants. All six of them looked completely at home with this man whose face looked very familiar? but we could really recognise the man. It looked somewhat like Manish Makhija, aka Channel V?s Udham Singh, who made Hariyanvi cool much before Dangal happened. Manish, fondly known as Munna, was also Pooja Bhatt?s ex-husband. But it was unlikely that any star would have his ex-husband hanging around when she had called the media home. But then this was Pooja Bhatt, as unconventional and unorthodox as ever. The team goes and says hi to him and makes sure that he was indeed the man. But we were still hesitant to ask Pooja what her husband of 11 years, whom she had amicably broke up with three years back, is doing in her farmhouse. Sensing our curiosity she smiles and reveals that in fact they are still not legally separated! ?You know, we never really got divorced on paper!? WHAT? ?I don?t believe that a piece of paper can decide your relationship status. We made a choice to get married, to stay together, to end our marriage, and to remain friends. We never had any kind of obligations in our relationship other than when you have is that when you hold each other?s hand, you never let it go of it. That?s the kind of person I am and that?s the kind of person Munna is. You need not live in the same room for that.?

A German man is paid to taste water,"You might think you have a high-paying and relaxing job, but what you do for a living is nothing compared to what Martin Riese does. He tastes different kinds of bottled water, and gets paid s**tloads of money for it!Yes, you read that right. Riese is a German water expert, and believes that water should be treated the same way as wine. What does that mean? Well, if we can go around tasting varieties of wine, measuring and comparing the depth of their flavour, then why can't we do the same thing with bottled water?So, instead of a wine sommelier (a steward or expert trained in wine services), Riese is actually a water sommelier. What makes his taste buds tingle is nothing less than H2O, which might come in differently-shaped bottles, and look clear and pure, but it's actually nothing of the kind.Not many people know that bottled water or mineral water is actually graded according to their TDS level. TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids, or the mineral count in the water we drink. What this essentially means is that there is no bottled water that is pure (though it might look like it). In this day and age, water is treated, has differing mineral counts, and therefore different tastes. A water sommelier is just trained to identify these differences.Also read: Someone deep fried water successfully, just so you could have water pakorasAll you need to be good at this job is an unquenchable thirst for water. Riese is the only one who holds the title of water sommelier in the USA, where he moved from Germany in 2012. Apparently, water sommeliers are quite common in Europe, and all of them advocate water as the most precious drink in the world (now you just can't disagree with that!).Water has body, and depth--we all know this every time we drink some of it. But if the water sommeliers like Riese are to be believed, it has a lot to do with smell and sight as well as taste. Given the rising water crises we face globally, and our increasing dependence on packaged water, developing this sort of a flavour profile might just be the way to go for the future. And experts like Riese are actually doing their part in this venture.",general,2151,35,70

St Teresa's blue-bordered sari trademarked,"Amitava Roy Kolkata, July 9 (PTI) The famous blue-bordered sari of Mother Teresa, who has been canonised as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by the Vatican, has been recognised as an Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity. ""The Trade Marks Registry, Government of India, has granted the registration of the trade mark for that pattern of blue border of sari,"" Intellectual Property attorney Biswajit Sarkar said. The diminutive nun of Albanian descent went around the streets of Kolkata since 1948 to be with the poor and the destitutes wearing a white sari with three blue borders, the outer border being wider than the two inner ones. ""The blue-designed border on the sari worn by nuns of the Missionaries of Charity was recognised as Intellectual Property for the organisation on September four, 2016, the day the Mother was canonised,"" Sarkar told PTI here. ""The Missionaries of Charity does not believe in publicity and as such it was not publicised, but since we are witnessing unscrupulous and unfair usage of the design across the globe, we are now trying to spread awareness among people about the trademark,"" Sarkar said. ""The blue border pattern is a distinctive symbolic identity of the Missionaries of Charity under the concept of colour trade mark protection,"" he said. Applications were filed before the Trade Marks Registry on December 12, 2013 and after ""a stringent test of legal proceedings"" for nearly three years, the registrations were granted. In order to mark the sainthood of Mother Teresa, the Government of India granted the trade mark registration on the same day on September four, 2016, despite it being a Sunday, Sarkar said. The exclusive right of use of the said blue pattern on white saris adopted by the Missionaries of Charity is unique and is the first time ever that a uniform has been protected under the Intellectual Property rights, the attorney said. Born in 1910 at Skopje in Macedonia in a Catholic family and baptised as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, she came to India in 1929 as Sister Mary Teresa and went to Darjeeling for her novitiate period. She later came to Kolkata and was assigned as a teacher at Saint Marys High School for Girls before she was given consent by her convent in 1948 to work for the poor.",general,2259,42,70
Govt to seek info on deposits during note ban in I-T returns,"The taxman will seek data on deposits made by an assessee during the demonetisation period as part of the new Income Tax Returns (ITRs) that would be notified soon for assessment year 2017-18.

Sources indicated that the new column will also be introduced in the simplest form for individuals having salary income, called the ITR-1 or Sahaj. They said while the I-T department has given a number of opportunities to taxpayers o explain any unaccounted deposits made during the notes ban period like under the Operation Clean Money and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna (PMGKY), the move to introduce the new column is to ascertain all deposits made by a person or entity irrespective of the threshold. ""This is just an effort to ascertain what deposits were made during the demonetisation period. The department has not issued notices in cases where the deposit amounts were small,"" a senior officer said. They said the new ITR forms will continue having a column asking taxpayers to mention their Aadhaar number but, they said, this time it would be mandatory and not optional like it was last time. The e-verification of ITRs using the Aadhaar will continue, they said. The new ITR-1 or Sahaj, the officials said, has also been made simpler by bringing together the columns for all deductions and details about assets and liabilities.

Indian Army's ammunition will run out after 10 days of war,"The stock of as many as 61 types of ammunition - out of a total of 152 types of ammunition considered critical by the Indian Army to fight a war - is available for just 10 days only, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has found.The stocks of just 20 per cent of the armoury - 31 types of ammunition - were found to be satisfactory, the CAG has found. The CAG report was placed before the Parliament today.The Indian military is required to hold ammunition enough to fight a short intense war of 20 days. Earlier, Indian military was required to have store supplies, spares and ammunition - called War Wastage Reserve (WWR) - to fight a 40 day intense war. In 1999 the WWR was scaled down to only 20 days.The CAG says that of the 152 types of ammunition identified as critical stocks of only 31 were available for 40 days whereas as many as 12 types of ammunition was available for 30 to 40 days and stocks of as many of 26 types of ammunition was available for a little over 20 days.The CAG report says that while WWR stocks of some of the critical items have improved - for instance explosives and demolition items- ammunition for Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) and Artillery ammunition ""meant for sustaining superior fire power were under critical level"".FROM INDIA TODAY MAGAZINE: Unmade in India SHORTFALL NOT MET DESPITE SPECIAL PLANConcerned by shortfall, the previous UPA government had come up with a plan - Ammunition Road Map - to rapidly add to ammunition stocks by 2015.

Nitish Kumar is leader of the alliance but he has not asked for his resignation,"" Lalu told reporters after a separate meeting of RJD MLAs. ""Nitish Kumar is leader of grand alliance. We will not tolerate any disrespect towards him. We have formed the grand alliance, made Nitish CM. Why will we break the alliance,"" Lalu said. ""We have spoken to Nitish Kumar and he said he is not asking for Tejaswi's resignation. BJP is trying to frame us but are we are not afraid of their tactic,"" former CM Rabri Devi added. The fate of Bihar's Mahagathbandhan or grand alliance (RJD, JD-U and Congress) is likely to be decided today or by tomorrow as the JD-U is firm on Tejashwi's resignation.Nitish Kumar is expected to make some tough decision before the start of Bihar Asssembly's Monsoon Session (July 28) which the BJP has threatened to disrupt demanding the CM to take a call on his deputy.Tejashwi and his party RJD, which has most number of MLAs of the three alliance partners, have repeatedly described the corruption charges as a conspiracy by Opposition BJP. Earlier this month, Tejashwi and Nitish had a closed door meeting during which the deputy CM tabled his stance and claimed that he was being framed. Insiders said Nitish was not convinced with Tejashwi's explanation.It is believed that Nitish is miffed with Tejashwi as he has failed to present solid evidence in support of his 'not guilty' claim despite being given ample time.Congress President Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul Gandhi have also tried to bridge the ever-widening gap between the JD-U and RJD but in vain.The JD-U has made abundantly clear that Nitish Kumar's taintless image is more important to the party than sticking with power.

We will go through manufacturing hell: Tesla CEO Elon Musk,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has handed over the first of what he hopes will be a mass-market electric car to employee buyers, setting the stage for the biggest test yet of the company?s plans to revolutionise the auto industry. Outside Tesla?s factory in Fremont, California on Friday night, Musk showed off the $35,000 Model 3 which has a range of 220 miles (350 km) on a charge that marks a departure from the company?s earlier luxury electric cars. Hours before the event, Musk acknowledged it would be ?quite a challenge? to build the car during the early days of production. ?We?re going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell,? Musk told journalists. The over half a million reservations are up from about 373,000 disclosed in April 2016. Customers pay $1,000 refundable deposits for the car, which is eligible for tax credits. Any new buyers would likely not receive their car until the end of 2018, Musk said. A longer-range version of the car is priced at $44,000 and will drive 310 miles (500 km) on a single charge. The cars feature a streamlined dashboard devoid of buttons or knobs, with a touchstream display to the right of the driver.Tesla faces major hurdles living up to the Model 3 hype. The 500,000 vehicles Tesla vows to produce next year are nearly six times its 2016 production. Were Tesla to produce, and sell 500,000 cars per year, the company would likely outsell the BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus brands in the United States. Production delays and quality issues marred the launches of Tesla?s Model S and Model X vehicles, and the company blamed production problems for a shortfall during the second quarter of this year. Musk has said a simpler Model 3 design will greatly reduce potential assembly-line problems. Tesla has burned through more than $2bn in cash so far this year ahead of the launch. A troubled Model 3 launch could heighten the risks for the company, while a steady delivery of Model 3s could generate a stream of cash that would allow Tesla to avoid going again to the capital markets to fund its operations. Tesla?s share price has surged 54% since January in anticipation of the Model 3 launch, and Tesla?s pricey valuation now exceeds that of traditional rivals like General Motors and Ford . Until now, Tesla has operated as a niche producer of luxury electric vehicles, with a charismatic, showman chief executive who regularly interacts with fans on his Twitter account. Now loss-making Tesla is trying to move into a different league, building vehicles in high volume for customers able to pay only a few thousand dollars more than the average price of a conventional car or truck sold in the US. The Model 3 is part of Musk?s broader plan to build a clean energy and transportation company that offers electric semi trucks, rooftop solar energy systems and large-scale battery storage systems.",technology,2853,58,70
"Ola, Uber drivers to go on strike in Delhi","Brace for higher cab fares and longer waits on Tuesday as drivers? of online cab aggregators Ola and Uber are going to start round two of their protest. Though a one-day strike, the protest could severely hit the private transport service sector in Delhi-NCR as this time even the rivals of Ola-Uber drivers, kaali-peeli taxi operators, have joined hands.While most taxi and autorickshaw drivers, of an estimated 1-5 lakh app-based taxis in Delhi-NCR, have decided not to take out their vehicles on April 18, they also plan to do a protest march to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal?s residence in Civil Lines from the Majnu Ka Tila Gurudwara. The drivers have renewed the stir as they feel their demands have fallen on deaf ears ? ?neither the companies nor the Delhi government has done anything,? they claim. In February, Delhi-NCR got its first taste of a strike by Ola-Uber drivers against the cab aggregator companies, which impacted lakhs of commuters for almost two weeks. Leading the fresh protest is the same drivers? union, Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi (SDAD), which had organised the previous strike.?Nothing has changed since our February protest. Drivers continue to slog for 16-18 hours daily and still are barely earning enough to eat and pay the car EMIs. Fares of registered city taxis can only be fixed by the government, whereas, Ola-Uber still continue to levy their own rates,? said Kamaljeet Gill, president SDAD.Foes turn friendsTuesday?s strike has received support from at least a dozen transport unions active in the capital.Until now, drivers of kaali-peeli taxis, those with All India Taxi Permit (AITP) and auto-rickshaws had always protested against the Ola-Uber drivers for eating away into their earnings as the app-based cab service gained huge popularity.?Drivers of Ola-Uber are suffering because they are working like bonded labourers and are earning pittance. Like we have always been demanding, they also want meters installed in cabs and rates to be fixed by the government. Our issues have now become common and so we will fight together,? said Sanjay Samrat of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association. He added that the app-based cab companies are flouting not only laws but also directions issued by the Supreme Court. ?Cabs are illegally being run on shared basis.

It also claims that ""jokes drawing attention to someones differences"" and ""not speaking directly to people"" are potential forms of ""everyday racism"". The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit explains in the newsletter that ""some people who do these things may be entirely well-meaning, and would be mortified to realise that they had caused offence."" ""But this is of little consequence if a possible effect of their words or actions is to suggest to people that they may fulfil a negative stereotype, or do not belong,"" it states. However, some critics slammed the newsletter, saying it would make the students over sensitive. Dr Joanna Williams, a lecturer in higher education at the University of Kent, said the guidance was ""completely ridiculous"" and will make students ""hyper-sensitive"" about how they interact with one another. ""Essentially people are being accused of a thought crime. They are being accused of thinking incorrect thoughts based on an assumption of where they may or may not be looking,"" she said. Williams, who is author of Academic Freedom in an Age of Conformity, said that Oxford Universitys guidance was ""overstepping the mark"" by telling students ""how they should feel and think"". Tom Slater, co-coordinator of The Free Speech University Ranking project that highlights censorship on university campuses, called it ridiculous to suggest that not looking someone in the eye was a micro form of racism. ""This is all part of a chilling desire on the part of university authorities to police not just opinions, but everyday conversations between students,"" he told The Times. An Oxford University spokesman was quoted as saying that, ""The Equality and Diversity Unit works with University bodies to ensure that the Universitys pursuit of excellence goes hand in hand with freedom from discrimination and equality of opportunity.""",general,2439,60,70

Akshay was 1st choice for Sohail's role in Tubelight: Report,"Kabir Khan's Tubelight has already grabbed eyeballs for the on-screen camaraderie between Salman Khan and Sohail Khan, who play brothers in the film too. But not many know that Sohail wasn't the first choice to play Bharat in Tubelight. In fact, Kabir wanted Akshay Kumar to play Salman's on-screen brother in the film. In an interview to DNA, Kabir revealed that while writing the script of the film, he was keen to cast an A-lister for Bharat's role. ""Instead of a real brother, I thought we should get another actor and create the chemistry on screen,"" he told the daily. The director, who has collaborated with Salman for the third time, said that he had a few actors in his mind during the scripting stage, and Khiladi Kumar was one of them. ""That was while we were developing the script, and before we could decide, I was convinced by Sohail. Maybe, with another actor, I would have had to spend time and create the chemistry that Salman and Sohail share,"" he added. However, it was Salman who was keen to get Sohail on board as he was convinced that their real-life bromance will translate effectively on screen. ""They wanted someone bigger so that we could crack the number game and earn more at the box office. But I wanted to be really comfortable, and honestly, with Sohail, I didn't need to act too much. The emotions came automatically. So when you see the tears in the film, sometimes, they are my own emotions as a brother,"" said Salman. Kabir, who has worked with Sohail for the first time, is happy with the actor's hardwork in the film. ""We put Sohail through a lot of hard work, like making him sprint across the mountains of Ladakh - anybody else in his place would have said, 'I'm out of this place', but Sohail kept going even with his oxygen pump in hand. Sohail's is a dignified character in the film. People will love him, I am sure,"" he added. Tubelight is set to hit the screens this Eid.",general,1917,60,70

Widow of IAF pilot received pension after waiting for 55 yrs,"The widow of an ace Air Force pilot, who died in a plane crash in service, had to wait over five decades after her husband's death to get the pension due to her, in an incident underscoring government apathy towards families of martyred soldiers.Kamla Lowe, now 95, was fighting for the special family pension, which is given to widows of officers and men who died in service while carrying out their duties. A military court finally gave her justice.Squadron Leader JM Lowe was a test pilot in the Air Force on deputation with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and died on June 19, 1962 in a flying accident. His widow with her four-year-old child had been fighting since then for the dues.THE INCIDENTThe accident occurred 55 years ago in Bengaluru while the pilot was test-flying the Gnat aircraft, which developed severe mechanical failure witnessed as ""violent pitch oscillations"" prior to delivery to the IAF.""Despite the fact that the officer's widow is entitled to special family pension, the government in September 2004 rejected her appeal by giving an illogical reason that under the terms of deputation the applicant had already availed the benefits of insurance,"" Lowe's counsel Wing Commander Ajay Bhalla told Mail Today.Kamla Lowe also had to wait nine years for getting the ordinary pension and had to suffer a lot because of the lack of it, her husband's case revealed.The lady had also been fruitlessly writing letters to various authorities concerned to get her dues from the government.The government countered her by saying that she could not be given the special pension as her husband had opted for an insurance scheme before his death and also opposed the plea in the Armed Forces Tribunal, saying that she had come for justice after 55 years and her plea should dismissed on the basis of delay in approaching the court.The government also told the court that finding papers of the family pension granted to the widow of the officer and documents related to his deputation to HAL also could not be found as the matter was very old.""Pained"" by the sufferings of the IAF officer's widow, the tribunal bench headed by Chairperson Justice Virendra Singh said, ""Apart from the awful trauma of losing her husband, and having to bring up her four-year-old child, all alone, we observe that for almost nine years this widow was not even granted the basic right of ordinary family pension."" The chairperson in his order said the terms and conditions of that insurance (opted for by the martyred pilot) ""are not before us"".""However, it would be pertinent to mention that no insurance scheme can take away the right of pension of a serviceman, and therefore, consequently the widow,"" he said.The court said the government has to deal fairly with its workforce as ""employees cannot be asked to sign undertakings contrary to law.""Ruling in favour of the elderly lady, the court said, ""We find no impediment in the applicant being granted Special Family Pension as prayed for.

Legal suit filed against Kangana's character in Rangoon,"Just a week ahead of its release, news is out that director Vishal Bhardwaj's Rangoon starring Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan is caught up in legal trouble.Film production company Wadia Movietone Pvt. Ltd. has reportedly filed a commercial suit against Vishal Bhardwaj and others in the Mumbai High Court on grounds of copyright infringement.According to a report in Mid-Day, Roy Wadia on behalf of Wadia Movietone Pvt. Ltd. has claimed that Miss Julia, the character of Kangana Ranaut - a strong stuntwoman - is based on real-life Australian stunt actor Mary Evans, popularly known in India and around the world as Fearless Nadia.Wadia's firm hold rights to all scripts, publicity material and posters for the Fearless Nadia films it has produced. The Wadias' suit alleges that the makers of Rangoon have infringed on the copyrighted Fearless Nadia's characters, costumes, persona and even her signature ""Bloody Hell!"" phrase.Watch Bloody Hell from Rangoon here:Bloody Hell is the first single from Rangoon that was released and it focused on the character of Kangana Ranaut entertaining soldiers of British-occupied India.Why Roy Wadia is angryRoy Wadia, the Managing director of Wadia Movietone Pvt. Ltd. alleges that Rangoon's makers have carried out a ""breach of trust.""Back in 2006, Ronnie Screwvala of UTV was approached by Roy Wadia to make a film on Nadia. Things did not work out but soon news emerged that Vishal Bhardwaj was making a similar film for UTV.UTV and Vishal Bhardwaj told Roy Wadia that their film, then-titled Julia, was not inspired by the story of Fearless Nadia. Later, Wadia learned that the film was shelved. In 2008, Wadia signed an agreement with a German firm that it could use all of Wadias' copyrighted material on Fearless Nadia to make a film on her.Seven years later, Roy Wadia got news that a film called Rangoon was being made and that it was supposedly based around Nadia's life. Wadia told the film's makers that the rights to Fearless Nadia's character and story were with a German firm and if Vishal and co. still went ahead with Rangoon, they could land in legal trouble. Disney UTV (then, headed by Siddharth Roy Kapur) assured Wadia and the German firm that the film wouldn't be made.Then in 2016, while Vishal was making Rangoon with Sajid Nadiadwala, Vishal assured Roy Wadia that his film was a love story set in the backdrop of World War II and was not remotely inspired by Nadia's life. UTV Disney by then was not in the picture.When Wadia finally saw the film's promos in 2017, he realised that Kangana's character Julia was indeed inspired from the life of Fearless Nadia.Watch Rangoon trailer here:Now, the suit comes up for hearing in Mumbai High Court on February 20.While the Rangoon camp has been quiet about this since the matter is sub-judice, a member from Rangoon's cast, requesting anonymity said, ""Kangana was advised to watch Hunterwali (a famous 1935 Fearless Nadia stunt film), and the stylists told to reference her dressing for Kangana, who plays Julia. Some of the male characters also resemble those from Nadia's life.""",general,3108,55,70

South Delhi Municipal Corp to start e-toll collection,"The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) plans to install an electronic toll system for collecting tax, in order to decongest toll plazas.The equipment will be installed at 13 locations by the end of March, 2017, on a pilot basis.?We have started the tender process and a total of 65 lanes will be developed at 13 toll plazas for e- toll collection system. Based on the reviews, we will extend it to other locations. We will complete the work by end of the financial year,? said Puneet Goel, commissioner, South Corporation. ?It will work faster, compared to the manual process of collecting toll tax and also help reduce traffic jams,? he added. The toll points selected for the project include Ghazipur (main and old), Shahdara flyover, Kundli, Rajokri, Kalindi Kunj, Tikri, Kapashera and Aya Nagar.The terms and conditions for the functioning of the system have been laid out on the advice of the Environment Pollution Control Authority.The e-toll system involves tax payment through Radio Frequency Device System (RFDS), which allows the automatic deduction of toll tax from the customer?s account. ?We will sell the Radio Frequency Identification cards to the vehicle owners and recharge it with a certain amount. The ID will be pasted on the windshield of the vehicles. The e-toll machine installed at the toll plaza will read the ID card at a distance of 100 metres and automatically deduct the amount from person?s account,? said Shailendra Singh, standing committee chairman.

This year, the South Corporation collected a total of ?630 crores from toll plazas.Sunil Dahiya, a Greenpeace India campaigner, said the equipment would help monitor the vehicles entering the city and reduce the emission of fuel. ?It will no doubt help reduce air pollution.

"Gangster makes threat call from jail, two arrested","Two persons, including a policeman, were arrested by the Gurgaon police for allegedly getting a gangster to make a ?threatening? phone call for mediating in a property dispute in Wazirabad village on Wednesday. Police said an inmate who was lodged in Bhondsi jail sought the help of gangster Manjeet Mahal to threaten the other group lead by Rakesh, which had claimed the plot on the upscale Golf Course Road. On June 27, the call was made by gangster on behalf of the inmate and ASI Raj Singh was involved in making this happen, a police official said. ?As the phone call was made from inside the jail, it is a very serious matter and two persons, including a policeman, have been booked. The matter will be investigated thoroughly to ensure that such threats are not made again,? said Sumit Kuhar, DCP, crime. Kuhar said the matter was brought to the notice of the police on Wednesday and action was taken immediately as the matter was serious. ?Mahal was taken on production warrant on Friday and if this matter had come to our notice then we could have questioned him earlier,? he added. Ironically, while Mahal was at the Crime Branch, Palam Vihar, four police officials were suspended for drinking liquor during the duty hours inside the office premises. As per the police, the matter pertains to a 500 square yard plot which is claimed by Rakesh, a resident of Jhund Sarai village and another man identified as Rajkumar. On June 8, there was a fight between both groups as a result of which the inmate was booked and sent to Bhondsi jail, where he got in touch with the Manjeet Mahal gang.On Surender?s behest, a phone call was made to Rakesh to leave the plot of land, else he should be ready to face ?the consequences?. However, as the phone call was made from jail, the police got active after getting the complaint and booked the inmate as well as ASI Raj Singh of the crime branch, and took him into custody for further questioning. The Gurgaon police had carried out a major search operation last month in Bhondsi jail and recovered over a dozen mobile phones from the inmates. In fact, a highly placed source said that as the jammers at the jail were inadequate, the inmates used ingenious methods to keep the phones, and use them intermittently to run their extortion and other rackets.",general,2303,51,70

Nagaland CM fails to come up for floor test,"Nagaland chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu and nine ruling Naga People?s Front (NPF) legislators skipped Wednesday?s floor test, forcing assembly speaker Imtiwapang Aier to adjourn the special session of the House.It could not be immediately confirmed if the speaker sent a report in this regard to state governor PB Acharya. Acharya had summoned the special session of the assembly at 9:30am after the Nagaland bench of the Gauhati high court on Tuesday dismissed Shurhozelie?s petition challenging the floor test that was earlier to be held by July 15. An MLA in Shurhozelie?s camp, declining to be quoted, said the chief minister and his loyalists could not attend the special assembly session because they had to attend a funeral service in state capital Kohima?s Bayavu Hill.

Zeliang and his team checked into a resort in Assam?s Kaziranga on Saturday 8 before they had to be evacuated because of flood in July 14. That very day, Shurhozelile went to court challenging Acharya?s July 9 call to prove his majority on the floor of the house on or before July 15. The court gave a temporary breather to Shurhozelie before the floor test could be held last Saturday. NPF spokesperson Achumbemo Kikon, a member of Shurhozelie?s legal team, indicated the chief minister would not give up easily without a fight. ?We are exploring many options before us,? he told reporters in Kohima.

Zeliang , who claims the support of 43 MLAs including seven independents, had accused Shurhozelie of ?undemocratic style of functioning? and ?nepotism?. It was primarily a reference to the chief minister appointing his son Khriehu Liezietsu as his advisor with cabinet minister status on June 27. Khriehu declined the ?offer? offer 13 days later, but by then the damage ? rebellion against his father ? was already done. His appointment was seen as payback for resigning from the Northern Angami-I seat for letting his father contest to continue as chief minister. A?combined photo of posters put up by a social NGO named Naga Peace Task Force. (HT?Photo) Before challenging the order, the 80-year-old Shurhozelie had indicated the dissidents wanted to deny him the chance to contest the July 29 by-election to the Northern Angami-I seat. On Tuesday night, after the governor sought a floor test, the Shurhozelie camp of NPF issued a whip to all its 47 MLAs for Wednesday?s floor test. The party warned that failure to comply would invite ?consequences? as provided under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The Shurhozelie camp of NPF also decided to sever its 40-year-old ties with the BJP and approach the President of India for recalling the governor ?so that the sanctity of the Raj Bhawan is maintained in future?. The BJP retaliated by announcing its support to Zeliang and NPF legislators loyal to him. Meanwhile, the political crisis in Nagaland has inspired a tongue-in-cheek poster campaign by a social NGO named Naga Peace Task Force. One of the posters read: ?When you elect clowns, expect a circus?.",general,3271,43,70
"Expel Lalu's son, will support your govt: BJP to Nitish","As speculations are rife that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may ask his deputy and Lalu Yadav's younger son Tejashwi Yadav to reisgn after CBI raids against him, Bihar BJP today said they will support the JD-U government from outside.""I appeal Nitish Kumar to expel Tejashwi Yadav. After that if they need it we are ready to support them,"" said. However, he said, it is the central leadership that will take the final decision.""In RJD there is no meaning of a meeting. Today's meeting was a drama and whatever happens in the party is what Lalu Yadav wants,"" he said.The BJP leader said Nitish Kumar will have to leave the Congress as Sonia Gandhi has already said that she is with Lalu Yadav in the corruption case.""And BJP's dream is to make India Congress-free,"" he said adding that Nitish Kumar's image which was that of good governance has also been affected.""But if Nitish Kumar will need to save his government then BJP will not be behind. We will support his government from outside but will not join it,"" Bihar BJP president Nitayanand Rai said.Even after the CBI filed a case against him and his family members, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has decided that Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav will not resign.Nitish Kumar, who is heading the Grand Alliance government of Janata Dal-United, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress in Bihar, is yet to comment on the matter but he spoke with Lalu last night on the phone.There has been speculation of cracks in the alliance government after the CBI crackdown against the Yadav family and Nitish's increasing closeness with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Nitish, who was in an alliance with the BJP for 17 years, has been giving political signals of getting closer to the BJP.Surgical strikes on Pakistan and demonetisation have been a few instances where Nitish has been the lone opposition face to come out and openly extend his support to PM Modi, much to the discomfort of the Opposition, especially RJD chief Lalu Prasad with whose support he is running a coalition government in Bihar.Even in the presidential election, Nitish has decided to support NDA nominee Ram Nath Kovind and not the opposition's candidate Meira Kumar.

BSF to use capsicum-based teargas to control crowds,"After trying out PAVA shells, security forces have now turned to capsicum gel-based teargas to quell mobs in the Kashmir valley and other places.A senior BSF official said the new teargas will be ready for use by security forces in spray can and shell forms, as early as next month.The non-lethal munition can be used by security forces at any location in the country where there is a law and order problem but the largest inventory of the product is expected to be shipped to the Valley owing to the number of public protests and incidents of stone pelting, the official said.The shells will be produced by the Tekanpur (Madhya Pradesh)-based Tear Smoke Unit (TSU) of the Border Security Force.Last year, the TSU had launched the PAVA teargas munitions which, the BSF said, was ?effectively? used by various police and security forces.However, sources in the security establishment had said the personnel on ground in Kashmir had given feedback that PAVA (Pelargonic Acid Vanillyl Amide) was not an effective replacement for the controversial pellet guns and hence some other non-lethal ammunition should be provided to them to counter stone pelters and protestors.The new bio-friendly oleoresin capsicum-based teargas shells will be produced in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).The official said the chilli ingredient for these new munitions will be sourced from the jungles of the northeast and Andhra Pradesh and have two variants.?One will be a teargas shell and the other spray can. The ultimate product will be helpful for police and security forces to combat both close-quarter and distant targets,? the official said.In the first go, about 50,000 shells will be produced by the TSU which will be followed by subsequent need-based orders from the forces.An annual general body meeting of the TSU was also held under the chairmanship of BSF Director General K K Sharma at the forces? headquarters here today.?The governing body also reviewed the progress of automation and production management of the TSU,? a BSF statement later said.PAVA was introduced last year by the Union home ministry after scores of protesters were blinded by the use of pellet guns in the Kashmir valley.The pellet guns have not been discarded and are now used sparingly by the forces there.",general,2319,51,70

Istanbul nightclub massacre suspect captured,"The man suspected of shooting dead 39 people in a New Year?s Eve attack on a nightclub in Istanbul has been arrested, Turkish officials said late last night.It is understood the Uzbek national, named as Abdulkadir Masharipov by the Turkish media, was captured in a raid by security forces on a house in the residential Esenyurt district of Istanbul, 25 miles from where the attack took place.A state news agency also reported that four other people were arrested with him, including a Kyrgyz man and three women.The state-run Anadolu Agency said the suspects were being taken to Istanbul?s police headquarters for questioning.

He then fled with his four-year-old son, who was still with him when he was pinned down by officers and handcuffed, according to the Turkish newspaper Hürriyet. A photograph circulated on social media by the publication shows a bruised and bloodied black-haired man.The Turkish television channel NTV said the suspect?s son had been taken into protective custody. It said police had established the gunman?s whereabouts four or five days ago, but delayed the raid to monitor his movements and contacts.Before the arrest, Turkey?s deputy prime minister said he believed the attack had been carried out professionally and an intelligence organisation was involved.During an interview with broadcaster A Haber on Monday, Norman Kurtulmus said: ?It was an extremely planned and organised attack.?",world,2534,44,70

Delhi's domesticated elephants may be shifted to a sanctuary,"Delhi could soon lose all its seven elephants with the state forest department planning to shift them to a sanctuary outside the national capital. ?It would be wiser to shift them to safer confines with relatively larger natural environs away from human habitation,? said a report prepared by the forest department. The report has been submitted to the high court earlier this month.The city has seven domesticated elephants owned by four people. While six are kept at Sangam Vihar in Wazirabad, one is kept at a JJ cluster in Laxmi Nagar.The owners of the elephants have requested the forest officials not to separate them from the elephants as the animals would die without them. They have instead requested the forest department to give them a plot of land where they can move with the animals. ?We have asked the owners to respond within four weeks. If they don?t respond, we would shift the elephants to some area outside Delhi,? said AK Shukla, chief wildlife warden of Delhi In 2016, a committee comprising wildlife officials had recommended that all the elephants should be confiscated as their health was poor and the animals were kept in bad conditions. The owners, however, moved court challenging the committee?s report. In May 2017, a separate committee was formed on the orders of the court which inspected the elephants again. The report was submitted earlier this month. The five-member committee comprised officials of the forest department, the central zoo authority and the vet of the National Zoological Park in New Delhi. The committee, after inspecting the animals, found that not only the elephants were kept in poor conditions but it was also risky to keep the elephants in crowded localities. A number of cases have been earlier reported where domesticated elephants have gone on a rampage killing people. ?Housing elephants inside a crowded and congested colony is a high-risk affair. The risk was compounded as there were neither any secondary barriers to restrain the elephants in case they broke the chain with which they are tied, nor there were any tranquilising guns or medicines to restrict them,? the report said. The committee found that most of the animals were suffering from poor health which suggests that they were not properly fed and don?t undertake exercises such as long walks. They have cracked nails which suggest they have very poor foot care. ?Sometimes they are made to walk through a maze of traffic dust and exhaust fumes which they may find terrifying? the report states. The committee has also raised questions about their ownerships. The report states that most of the elephants have no proper ownership certificates. ?The elephants are like our family members. We would die without them. We have proper license to keep them. It is only because of some animal right activists and influential NGOs that we are being made victims. We will again approach the court if necessary,? said Yusuf Ali, whose family owns three elephants.",general,2982,60,70

"Bangladesh, India to allow free passage for elephants","Illegal migrants from Bangladesh entering India is a contentious issue between both neighbours. While New Delhi contends large-scale influx from across the border, Dhaka has denied these migrants are their citizens.There was no such difference though when officials of both nations agreed on Thursday to construct gates along the border to allow ?free and safe passage? for wild elephants.Setting up of the gates was one of the 18 points of action agreed between both countries at the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh dialogue on trans-boundary conservation of elephants held at Shillong.?Trans-border migration of animals is a natural process. But due to erection of border fences, there have been occasions when elephants have broken barriers to continue on their route. The gates will allow them safe passage,? India?s director general of forest Siddhanta Das told HT.Officials have identified 12 points in Meghalaya and one in Assam along the border, which are used by wild elephants to travel to Bangladesh, where the gates will be constructed.It is estimated nearly 20 pachyderms from India move to Bangladesh annually around winter and return later.?We will be tracking these animals and use the services of security and forest personnel on both sides of the border to ensure that the elephants don?t face any problems,? said Das.Construction of the gates, which would require cutting of border fencing between both countries at some points, is expected to be over before the 3rd round of the dialogue on the issue in Dhaka next year.Both countries also agreed to discourage and regulate construction of electric fences to protect crops in the areas which fall in the routes taken by the elephants to prevent deaths due to electrocution.Measures to prevent or bring down incidents of human-elephant conflict while the pachyderms crisscross between both countries, such as setting up warning systems and planting of trees to act as bio-fence, were also discussed.There are nearly 9,000 wild elephants in the northeast region, around 1800 of them in Meghalaya alone, and sometimes they venture to Bangladesh in search of food or mates.Last year, a wild elephant was swept away to Bangladesh by the flooded waters of Brahmaputra from Dhubri in Assam. The animal, named Banga Bahadur by people in Bangladesh, died after 50 days of efforts between two countries to bring it back.",general,2368,53,70

"Over 1,500 Delhi children reported missing till May in 2017","New Delhi, the capital has lived up to its fearful reputation of disappearing kids with over 1,500 children -- mostly between 6 and 15 -- reported missing in the first five months of this year, according to police figures.And only few are expected to return home, going by the past trends on tracing missing children.The latest data follows the disturbing trend of over a dozen children going missing in the capital each day and despite CCTV cameras and hi-tech aids, Delhi Police are finding it difficult to locate them.The success rate of Delhi Police is unimpressive, with a majority of the located children being those who return home on their own, according to crime record data.Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajan Bhagat said that the missing children mostly are in the age group of 6 and 15 and belong to economically weaker familes of downmarket areas of Delhi.""As per the data, around 12 to 15 children are reported to be missing every day in Delhi,"" Bhagat said.He said there was a possibility of the involvement of ""some inter-state human trafficking gangs"" who usually prowl the slum areas and abduct kids of ""deprived and migrants families"" for cheap labour.The capital has a bad record on account of missing children. As per government figures tabled in parliament during the budget session, nearly 27,000 children have gone missing in Delhi in the last five years and only 9,700 could be traced.Across the country, 30 per cent of the children remained untraceable, but in Delhi the number is the highest - 63 per cent.INITIATIVES LAUNCHED Bhagat said police have launched a scheme, ""Pehchaan: Safeguarding the Childhood"", as part of its anti-human trafficking drive.Under the 'Pehchaan' initiative, children belonging to poor families residing in JJ clusters and resettlement colonies are being registered and photographed from time to time with the district police ""so that they can be traced if they happen to go missing in future"", Bhagat said.Bhagat said the ""situation is alarming"" in the capital and ""sometimes it is difficult to trace missing children since poor families do not even have photographs"" of their children.Thus beat constables have been tasked to capture photograph of all kids in slum areas, he said.""Under the 'Pehchaan' scheme, we also create awareness with the help of NGOs from time to time about crime rates with minors and juvenile in the capital. We educate parents on how to take care of their children.""HELP OF CYBER EXPERTS IN FINDING CHILDREN Sometimes police even take help of cyber-experts to trace those missing children who have access to cellphones and have social networking accounts.They are mostly aged 12-17 and such children leave their houses of their own volition. But sometimes they do access their social networking accounts and police cyber experts follow their IP addresses.But the number of such cases is minimal, a cyber expert officer said. Police also take help of NGOs as sometime children, who have been abducted and employed as domestic helps, get in touch with voluntary groups.These NGOs -- like ""Bachpan Bachao Andolan"" run by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi -- play a crucial role in informing the police about exploitation of children.Satyarthi's group on May 18 rescued nine children -- aged between 7 and 15 -- from an illegal factory in old Delhi's Daryaganj area, where they were forced into slavery after being trafficked from Bihar.Also Read:Delhi's missing children: 12-15 kids disappear every day, 4 out of 10 never returnFree education upto class 12 for children of HIV positive patientsMissing children to be traced by face soonAlso Watch:",general,3628,59,70
"Over 80,000 children 'wasting' from hunger in Myanmar: UN","More than 80,000 children under the age of five living in majority-Muslim areas of western Myanmar are ?wasting? and will need treatment for acute malnutrition over the next year, the World Food Programme has warned.The report from the United Nations agency was based on an assessment of villages in western Rakhine state, where some 75,000 stateless Muslim Rohingya people have fled a bloody army crackdown.Those who remain are now reeling from a food crisis, with WFP finding one-third of homes are experiencing extreme food deprivation in Maungdaw, one district particularly affected by the violence. This includes episodes of no food in the house or not eating for 24 hours.A quarter of all households composed of only one female adult as the men had left due to the military campaign. These households had the highest frequency of episodes of severe hunger, WFP said.No children under the age of two met minimum adequate diet requirements, the assessment found, while 225,000 people need humanitarian assistance.?It is estimated that 80,500 children under the age of five are expected to be in need of treatment for acute malnutrition over the next twelve months,? the WFP report said. A WFP spokesperson in Myanmar said this ?wasting? ? condition of rapid weight lose that can become fatal ? impairs the functioning of the immune system.?The survey has confirmed a worsening of the food security situation in already highly vulnerable areas following the security incidents and ensuing violence in late 2016,? the WFP report said.In October last year, Rohingya militant attacks on border police sparked army retaliation in which government forces have used helicopters to attack villages.The country?s de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991, has been criticised by more than a dozen fellow laureates for the armed response. They wrote an open letter to the UN security council warning of a tragedy ?amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity? in Rakhine state.Regardless, Myanmar said last month it will refuse entry to members of a United Nations investigation focusing on allegations of killings, rape and torture by security forces against Rohingya Muslims. The WFP assessment found that in area affected by the violence, nearly half of the markets were not or only partially functioning. ?Food prices were highly volatile, and supply of affordable dried fish, a main source of proteins for the population, was scarce,? the report said.?Under these circumstances and with the upcoming rainy season that may aggravate an already fragile situation, the capacity of the most vulnerable population to access sufficient food in the long-term is severally undermined and will depend on the humanitarian assistance in the near future.?",world,2795,57,70
Successive governments short-changed Air India: TMC leader,"New Delhi, Aug 2 (PTI) Successive governments have ""short changed"" Air India by treating it like their private properties, TMC leader Dinesh Trivedi said today as he urged the Centre to review the decision to divest stake in the airline. ""By just looking at the debt and ignoring the revival signs would be to take a narrow view of the situation,"" the former railway minister said. As part of efforts to revive the national carrier, the Cabinet has given in-principle approval for divestment and the final contours are being worked out by a group of ministers. ""If Air India today is in this financial situation it was not because of Air India but successive governments have short-changed Air India and treated it like their private properties and at times private airlines, be international or domestic came under category of favoured airlines,"" Trivedi told PTI.

JD(U) slams Modi for making cow an agenda to polarise votes,"The Janta Dal United (JDU) has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he made an emotional pitch in Gujarat on Thursday asserting that killing in the name of cow protection was unacceptable. The JD-U, hitting out at the prime minister, said that there has been a spurt in incidents of lynching and killing in the name of ""gau raksha"" across the country because the BJP government made cow a national agenda for seeking and polarising votes.Speaking to India Today, JD-U spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that PM Modi was more interested in votes in the name of cow rather than ""gau seva"".""PM has had to appeal the gau rakshaks for the second time not to kill people in the name of cow. This is because PM has made cow the national agenda for doing politics and this had to be the result. PM was not interested in gau seva but polarisation of votes in the name of gau,"" said Kumar. MOST LYNCHING INCIDENTS HAPPENED IN BJP-RULED STATES Kumar said that it was BJP-ruled states like Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand which reported most of the cases of killing and lynching. He demanded that making emotional appeals was not enough and the government should ensure harshest punishment for people accused of indulging in killings in name of cow protection.""It seems that the authority of PM Modi is declining, especially in BJP-ruled states where there are several fake gau rakshaks. PM should feel ashamed of this. Has he become so weak that he has to make appeal to gau rakshaks? He should take strict action against such fake gau rakshaks and speedy trial should take place so that justice is done, and these fake gau rakshaks are sent to jail,"" added the JDU spokesperson.Neeraj Kumar said that the Narendra Modi government was not bothered about development and employment but only about gau, gobar and beef.",general,1810,59,70

Maha govt tells court it can't find own highway notification,"The Bombay High Court today was informed by the Maharashtra government pleader that it cannot find the notification classifying roads as state highways and other roads. The reason Maharashtra government is looking for this notification is because a bunch of petitions have been filed by liquor vendors and restaurant owners claiming that the excise department is now not renewing their licenses to sell or serve liquor as the department claims they are located on the highways.It was in December last year that the Supreme Court in its landmark judgment of State of Tamil Nadu V/s. K. Balu and others had directed for not issuing license to liquor shops and permit rooms within distance of 500 mtrs form the national and state highways. By the said judgment the apex court had also directed for not renewing license of existing shops and for not issuing new license for such shops after 31st March, 2017 along national and state highways. The petitioners claim that the bars, restaurants and wine shops are neither situated on a national highway nor on a state highway, but is located in by-lanes of the city, more than 500 meters from the highways. For example, one of the petitioners is King Wines, which is located in the heart of Kolhapur city. The petitioner submits that recently, their licenses were renewed for this year on accepting requisite license fees by the district collector and superintendent of state excise in Kolhapur. However, the same authorities, after renewal, directed the wine shop owner to forthwith, stop all their business owing to Supreme Court's order. Thus, during the last hearing on May 31st the division bench of Justice B P Colabawalla and Justice A M Badar had asked for the notification. Advocate Shrikrishna Ganbavale who is appearing for the petitioners explained, ""There has to be a notification from state government that this road or that road is a national highway or a state highway. Without that the state government cannot arbitrarily close down business establishments. That is why they have been asked to show the notifications.""The court has granted the state government time till Monday to get these notifications and has even asked the advocate general of Maharashtra to appear before them.",politics,2245,60,70

One killed as Swift Dzire tries to overtake Lamborghini,"Expressway, speed and a rush of adrenaline - the result is always fatal and 28-year-old Asad Malik became the latest victim of speed junkies on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.On Saturday afternoon, Malik's Eeco car was smashed by a Lamborghini that swerved to avoid a speeding Swift Dzire, resulting in his death. Strangely, the same 23-km-long expressway allegedly witnessed an illegal horse race too recently. The act was caught on camera and the video clip went viral on social media websites.The series of incidents not just raise questions on the safety feature of the expressway but also on the role of Noida police which is well-equipped to monitor such stretches. Even after 24 hours of the incident, Noida police have no clue about the identity of the Lamborghini driver involved in the accident. Similarly, the police were caught unaware on the horse-racing incident and are now scanning CCTV footages.INVESTIGATION IN THE CAR ACCIDENTThe investigation in the car accident is also based on the CCTV footage. The police have caught the driver of Swift Dzire and identified him as Mohsin Khan. ""All the cars involved in the accident were at a very high speed. CCTV footages show that speeding Swift Dzire was behind the Lamborghini car and tried to overtake it. The driver of Swift lost control and ventured into the lane of Lamborghini, forcing the driver of the sports car to swerve and avoid a collision. However, he smashed an Eeco, leading to Malik's death,"" said a senior police officer.Malik was a resident of Joshi Colony and was going to Greater Noida for work. ""He was brought to hospital, but had no pulse and was declared brought dead. He sustained severe head injuries and was bleeding heavily,"" said KK Tripathi, a doctor at Jaypee Hospital.Trying to conceal their failure in identifying the Lamborghini driver, Noida police claims Mohsin is the main accused as he lost control. But Mohsin blames the Lamborghini driver for the accident. ""The Ecco was racing with the Lamborghini and the accident took place between the two. I have no role in the accident as my car didn't even touch any car involved in the mishap. In fact, to avoid the accident, I had to collide my car with the divider. I stopped at the spot to cooperate in the investigation but police arrested me. I could have fled like the Lamborghini driver,"" Mohsin said.NO SUCCESS IN KEEPING A CHECK ON SPEED JUNKIESThe speed limit for heavy vehicles on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway is 60 kmph, and for light motor vehicles, it is 100kmph. There are 132 high definition cameras, installed along the expressway, which work under the highway traffic management system (HTMS) and is designed to capture only images of vehicles moving at more than 100kmph. But Noida police have not got much success in keeping a check on speed junkies.On the other hand, a recent video of horse racing on the expressway has put Noida police on the backfoot over successful usage of the high tech system. A viral video shot by an anonymous user has gone viral on social media, which captures around half a dozen jockeys racing on the highway alongside speeding cars.Noida police confirmed the video was shot at the expressway but are unaware when the incident took place. ""It is a serious matter and we are scanning cameras installed on the highway to check when the incident took place. We are trying to identify the horse riders,"" said a senior officer.But the entire incident also punches holes in patrolling along the expressway considered unsafe by users as many incidents of carjacking and robbery have taken place here. For many years Noida expressway has remained a favorite stretch for motorists as it offers non-stop drive till Greater Noida and further connects till Agra via Yamuna expressway. It is easy to spot 1000cc bikes and high-end sports cars cruising on this stretch and often 'illegally' used by motorists to race for money.Also Read:Bangladesh: 17 people killed in road accident in Rangpur",general,3983,55,70
Authorities plan night patrols to curb Noida sand mining,"A day after the district administration and the police, in a joint operation, seized illegally mined sand from two villages of Sikandarpur and Murshadpur, the district magistrate said he was planning to start night patrolling on the floodplains of river Yamuna to curb sand mining. The administration seized 10,638 cubic metres of sand in Sikandarpur and 7488 cubic metres of sand in Murshadpur area.?I have imposed a fine of Rs 70.69 lakh on both sand mafia groups caught mining sand from the two spots. I have instructed my staff to identify the properties that belong to two sand mafia groups. If they do not pay the penalty, we will auction their property,? said BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. . Residents of the villages near the floodplains feel that there is a dire need to have night patrolling as sand mining mostly takes place at night.?Sand mafia groups transports the sand in dumpers at night. It happens with the involvement of the local police. If the administration wants to stop sand mining, it should ensure that the police stop supporting the sand mafia,? said Tikam Singh, a resident of Nagli village. The administration said they get information about sand mining activities from the villagers who live along the Yamuna embankment. ?Any person can share information about sand mining with our officers or with me. We will ban illegal sand mining and take appropriate action on residents? complaints,? the DM said. The administration will also confiscate properties of those part of the sand mafia in order to recover revenue lost as a result of the illegal sand mining activity. Sand mining along Yamuna floodplains mostly takes place during the night as there is no patrolling during that time. ?We will auction the properties of the sand mafia to recover the revenue lost in illegal sand mining. Our priority is to ensure that no illegal sand mining takes place on the Yamuna floodplains,? BN Singh said. The DM has instructed all subdivisional magistrates to prepare a list of those involved in illegal sand mining in their respective areas. Once the list is ready, the DM will act against these people if they continue to mine sand from the Yamuna floodplains.Read I Noida DM takes on sand mafia, vows to end illegal mining?I will ask SDMs and the local police to start a joint night patrolling along the Yamuna floodplains so that we stop illegal sand mining,? Singh said. Illegal sand mining has been a lucrative business in Gautam Budh Nagar district, especially because sand is in huge demand for the construction activities in Delhi-NCR. As a result, trhe sand is almost worth its weight in gold. A dumper load of sand costs from Rs1,800 to Rs 2,000. To mine sand illegally, the sand mafia had even built a temporary bridge across the Yamuna to ferry sand from UP to Haryana. Authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar district in October, 2015, had caught about 30 labourers who were building the temporary bridge across the river to ferry sand. The district administration had dismantled the 300metre structure constructed near Noida?s Chak Basantpur village for trucks and dumpers carrying the coveted natural resource. The administration had also seized around 6,000 sandbags, several concrete pipes and an excavator as well. Later, the National Green Tribunal bar council had filed a petition in the tribunal which banned sand mining on Yamuna floodplains.",general,3402,56,70

The North MCD, which has 104 wards, is expected to give the BJP 78-84 seats, with AAP and Congress getting 8-12 each. Similarly, the 104-seat North MCD gives the BJP 79-85 seats. The AAP is placed somewhere between 9 and13 wards while the Congress at 7-11.The smaller East MCD, which has 64 wards, is expected to give the BJP 45-51 seats while the Congress 4-8 and the AAP 6-10.'POLL RESULTS ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS'""Exit poll results are according to our expectations,"" state BJP president Manoj Tiwari told Mail Today. Attributing the positive survey results to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tiwari said, ""PM Modi has won hearts of people from sections of society. The BJP has taken all its decisions for welfare of India while the AAP has looted citizens of Delhi.""Tiwari said exit polls results prove while the Congress has lost ground across the nation, there is simmering discontent and anger among Delhi electorate against CM Kejriwal.The survey results also indicate that the BJP has made new inroads in the national Capital, with the last-minute change in state leadership with an extra emphasis on poorvanchali voters having paid off rich dividends. The exit poll has predicted that 45 per cent of the poorvanchali vote went in favour of BJP.This section of voters was a key target of the party when they handed over the reins of city unit to Manoj Tiwari in November last year.The recent by-election results in Rajouri Garden assembly segment too proved this when the BJP's poll percentage in the constituency increased from 38 per cent in 2015 to 52 per cent in 2017. The seat saw a sharp decline of nearly 34 per cent in the vote share of incumbent AAP from 47 per cent in 2015 to 13.1 in 2017. In previous several elections, the party's vote share had remained between 30 and 35 per cent in the national Capital.While AAP leaders were quick to point out anomalies in electronic voting machines, they were at pains to explain how an exit poll survey, which is gauged out of speaking to a voter exiting the election booth, can be linked with faulty EVMs.Congress leaders advised patience till April 26 when the counting occurs. ""These (polls) violate moral code of conduct. The results will come on 26. Let us wait till then,"" Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said. The exit polls also indicate that the BJP has succeeded in making a dent in SC/ST and OBC votes in the national Capital. Apart from 54 per cent upper cast votes, the BJP is also expected to get 41 per cent of the SC/ST votes and 29 per cent OBC voters that are also considered the traditional vote bank of the Congress and the AAP.In 2012, the BJP bagged nearly 22 per cent of votes collectively in the three municipal corporations. In north MCD, the party polled 22.2 per cent, in South MCD 17.65 per cent and East 35 per cent.ALSO READ | MCD election 2017: Voting concludes, 53.58 per cent overall turnout",general,3594,49,70
Assam's only African white rhino dies without a mate at 47,"The lone African white rhino at the Assam State Zoo died of old age late Tuesday night, officials said. Mohan, 47, who was brought from the United States in 1974, died without mating. The zoo officials failed to find him a female partner in over four decades of his stay, despite him experiencing mood swings and exhibiting violent tendencies such as banging against the enclosure, which officials attributed to his ?frustration over sexual inactivity?.In 2005, Mohan was diagnosed with paratuberculosis, or Johne?s Disease, which is contagious, chronic and often fatal for ruminants such as cows but can also strike hindgut fermenters such as horses and rhinos. Zoo officials said they never expected Mohan to recover. ?He was too old to eat. His system was refusing to take food even in liquid form. He had battled diseases earlier, but gave up the fight at 11.30pm yesterday (Tuesday),? Tejas Mariswamy, the zoo?s divisional forest officer (DFO), told HT on Wednesday. The official explained than the average lifespan of rhinos is 45 to 50 years.Mohan, bought for Rs 50,000 from Southwitch Birds and Animals Inc in Black Stone, US, had attained sexual maturity three years after he landed at the zoo on December 22, 1974. He was long past his sexual prime when he developed the disease in 2005, by which time officials began describing the possibility of bringing a mating partner for him as ?dangerous?. ?Sadly, Mohan died without mating because a female white rhino could not be found in India,? Mariswamy said. Officials said Mohan could have been paired with a captive Indian female rhino. But the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) had in 1986 banned cross-mating of animals belonging to different species. The CZA?s move was in tune with the worldwide decision to stop hybridisation of big cats after the Alipore Zoo, Kolkata, had experimented with litigons (a cross between a lion and a tigress) and tigons (a tiger and a lioness) in the 1970s . Sangeeta Goswami of People For Animals said Mohan?s death is a reminder that feral animals should not be made to undergo life in captivity. ?The African rhino was denied sexual rights for no fault of his,? she said. A spokesperson of People for Ethical Treatment to Animals said, ?Captive breeding of animals in zoos is unethical, even if it means depriving a rhino its right to reproduction.?",general,2344,58,70

First wind farm powered by giant kites to be built in UK,"London, May 29 (PTI) Scientists are building the worlds first wind farm powered by giant kites in Britain that could generate enough electricity to run 5,500 homes. As many as twenty kites flying higher than Britains tallest building will work in pairs to generate electricity. They will fly in loops at more than 160 kilometres per hour. Their movement will pull on a tether wrapped around a rotating drum on the ground linked to a generator. The kites take turns to fly out and back, ensuring that the power supply is constant. Scotland-based company Kite Power Systems (KPS) has successfully tested a 40 kilowatt version. The company plans to build ten 500kW systems about 600 metres apart at a site by the year 2020.

Canal opened to swimmers after century closes within a week,"A new public swimming area on Paris?s Canal de l?Ourcq has reopened after it was temporarily closed due to higher than normal bacteria levels following weekend rains.The floating structure that has been put in place for the summer has allowed Parisians to legally swim in the canal at La Villette for the first time in decades. It proved very popular when it opened this month and was hailed by the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, as the beginning of a ?dream? to launch open swimming areas in other city waterways, including on the river Seine in 2024 if Paris succeeds in its bid to host the Olympics that year.The swimming area was briefly closed on Monday after a routine test on Sunday night found higher than normal levels of enterococci, bacteria found in faecal matter. The city of Paris tweeted that the pool was closed because the water quality was ?unsatisfactory?.The pool reopened on Tuesday morning after subsequent tests found the water quality was back to normal. It is thought that heavy rainfall at the weekend had led to the higher than normal readings of bacteria levels.Tests are regularly made at a point upstream from the swimming area to ensure the water quality is within guidelines. After a 10-year effort by the city to clean up the canal water, regular tests had consistently come back with satisfactory results showing the bacteria levels were far below accepted limits. Authorities said they would keep testing regularly during the swimming season.A spokeswoman for the Paris authorities said: ?Tests carried out on Monday night showed that the levels are now back in line with the requirements, so we have reopened the pool. It?s nothing serious. The water quality is good.?The floating pool structure, which can take up to 300 swimmers at a time, proved an instant hit after opening this month, and when Paris temperatures rose well above 30C, hundreds of people queued each day to get in.Inaugurating the facility, Hidalgo called it ?a dream come true?. The mayor has set a target of 2024, when the city hopes to host the summer Olympics, to have swimming areas at designated points along the Seine.After decades in which casual bathing in Paris?s river and canals was banned for many reasons, including strong currents, fears of bacteria and sewage pollution, authorities are moving to give swimmers more access.In recent years, lone swimmers could regularly be seen taking dips in the canal at La Villette of their own accord, despite the ?no swimming? signs.The official pool structure, opened by city hall at La Villette for the summer as part of the Paris Plages festival, marks the first time in many years that swimmers can legally swim there.",world,2678,59,70

Sherman said. ?It now seems likely that the president had something to hide when he tried to curtail the investigation of (now-fired) national security adviser Michael Flynn and the wider Russian probe,? he added. ?I believe his conversations with, and subsequent firing of, FBI director James Comey constitute obstruction of justice.?The White House reacted with disdain when a reporter asked for reaction to Sherman?s move.?I think that is utterly and completely ridiculous and a political game at its worst,?

Nixon resigned from office 13 days later.So far a single lawmaker, Democrat Al Green, has signed on to the resolution.While a number of Republicans have rebuked Trump or expressed concern for various stumbles, there is no signal from either the House of Representatives or the Senate that their Republican leaders are prepared to begin impeachment proceedings.",world,1869,55,70

However, these seats would be kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas. At the same time, these seats shall not be taken into account for reckoning the total membership of both houses and the said area shall be excluded in delimiting the territorial constituencies, the bill proposes.

Javadekar told PTI on Sunday after the Congress attacked the saffron party.He noted that senior Congress leaders like Shankersinh Vaghela, a former chief minister and the leader of opposition, its chief whip Balwantsinh Rajput and its spokesperson Tejashreeben Patel have left the party and wondered if the opposition party was suggesting that they could be ?bought?.?They are all strong leaders. Nobody can purchase them. The Congress should look inwards and think why such senior leaders are leaving it. The truth is that its only goal is to save Rahul Gandhi in the country and Ahmed Patel in Gujarat,? he said.Patel is seeking re-election to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat but defection by a number of Congress MLAs has left the party worried. The BJP has fielded Rajput, who quit the Congress on Thursday, against Patel to further queer his pitch.The Congress was growing weak across the country and it was not BJP?s fault, Javadekar said.In Ahmedabad, chief minister Vijay Rupani alleged that the decision to fly the Congress MLAs to Bengaluru amid flood-like situation in the state was taken by Patel out of his ?greed? to win the election.?Sonia Gandhi?s affection for her son has drowned the Congress in the entire country. Though the citizens rejected Rahul Gandhi?s leadership, Sonia?s ?putramoh? sank Congress. Similarly, Ahmed Patel?s greed to save his Rajya Sabha seat here will sink Gujarat Congress,? he said.According to Rupani, the Congress MLAs from flood-hot Banaskantha and other affected regions should have stayed with the people in this difficult time.?Out of his greed to win the Rajya Sabha poll, he (Patel) sent 40 Congress MLAs to Bengaluru. Some of them belonged to those districts which are badly hit by flood. Patel forced them to leave their constituencies, as he was only concerned about his Rajya Sabha seat,? the chief minister alleged.?The people of Gujarat are watching this. I believe that the Gujarat Congress will sink only because of Ahmed Patel,? he added.Patel, however, refuted Rupani?s allegation and said the Congress MLAs were forced to leave the state by the BJP-led state government.In the 182-member Gujarat Assembly, the strength of the Congress has gone down to 51 from 57 after six of its MLAs tendered their resignations.Party spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said the Congress legislators are willing to return home if Rupani promises their safety.?We have been threatened, offered money to defect and some have done so,? Gohil, the Congress MLA for Abdasa in the Kutch region, told reporters in Bengaluru.",general,3635,58,70
Florida enlists Indian snake hunters to catch pythons,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, Jan 27 (PTI) Two Indian snake hunters have been hired by Florida wildlife officials to get rid of Burmese pythons, which are wiping out small mammal populations driving some nearly to extinction in a tropical wetland in the US state. Masi Sadaiyan and Vaidivel Gopal, both in their 50s, from the Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu, are successful python hunters in India, and were brought in, along with two translators, to work with detection dogs earlier this month to track down and capture the giant snakes. In just eight days, they have surprised officals of Florida Fish and Wildlfe Conservation Commission (FWC) by bagging as many as 13 pythons, including a 16-foot-long female. A joint endeavour of FWC and University of Floridas Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFS), officials have described it as a ""unique project"". ""Since the Irula have been so successful in their homeland at removing pythons, we are hoping they can teach people in Florida some of these skills,"" said Kristen Sommers, section leader of the FWCs Wildlife Impact Management Section. ""We are working with our partners to improve our ability to find and capture pythons in the wild. These projects are two of several new efforts focused on the removal of these snakes,"" Sommers said. ""In their first eight days on the job, the Irula tribesmen ? world-renowned snake catchers from India ? removed 13 pythons, including four on their first visit to Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge on North Key Largo in partnership with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Traditionally, the main occupation of the Irula tribe has been catching snakes,"" a media release said. Officials said they are currently working with the Irula tribesmen to identify additional programmes to remove more nonnative pythons from Florida. The FWC and UF/IFAS have been collaborating with public land managers to identify environmentally sensitive areas that would benefit most from targeted python removal. Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge is one such area because of the federally-endangered Key Largo woodrat and many protected bird species that reside there.",general,2154,53,70

SBI to shut down 47% of associate banks' offices post merger,"State Bank of India (SBI), which will see five associate banks merge into it on April 1, has decided to shut down almost half the offices of these banks, including the head offices of three of them. This process will start from April 24.""Out of the five head offices of the associate banks, we will retain only two. Three head offices of the associate banks will be unbound along with 27 zonal offices, 81 regional offices and 11 network offices of the associate banks,"" SBI Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara told IANS in an interview.""We will keep their structure in place till April 24 and, post that, we will start dismantling the associate banks' controlling offices, which includes head offices, regional offices, zonal offices and network offices,"" Khara said.LIST OF ASSOCIATE BANKSThe five associate banks that will merge with SBI are: SBBJ (State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur), SBM (State Bank of Mysore), SBT (State Bank of Travancore), SBP (State Bank of Patiala) and SBH (State Bank of Hyderabad).SBI is India's largest bank with assets of Rs 30.72 lakh crore and figures at No. 64 in the global ranking of banks (as of December 2015; December 2016 ranking is still awaited). Post-merger, with assets of approximately Rs 40 lakh crore, it will be among the top 50 banks in the world. SBI Chief Economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh told IANS that, post-merger, the bank will be at No. 45.The shut-down move is to avoid overlapping offices in the same area and ""we intend to remove any kind of duplicacy in the controlling structure"", Khara said.The five associate banks will cease to exist as legal entities and become a part of SBI from April 1, but the various merger processes will start only after April 24, once the balance sheets of the five entities are audited and added.MANAGING DIRECTOR's VIEW""We will have to get the balance sheets of the associate banks audited a day prior to the merger, that is, on March 31. The balance sheets of the banks will be drawn up and added; it takes 15-20 days. Soon after the audit is done, the branches will be completely merged with SBI,"" Khara told IANS.There are currently 550 SBI offices while its associate banks have 259. The target for the number of controlling offices after the merger is 687 -- a reduction of 122 offices.Employees directly affected by these shutdowns -- estimated at 1,107 -- will be redeployed, mostly in customer-interface operations, Khara said.""The net result is that people in controlling functions will be available for deployment on the ground for improving reach to the consumer,"" he said.""There are about 5-7 people in every regional office and 20-odd people in each zonal office. One regional office controls 30-40 branches, while 4-5 regional offices are controlled by one zonal office,"" he told IANS.The associate banks have also offered a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to employees who do not wish to relocate.

Government to provide cradles for abandoned babies,"For years, poverty along with the cultural bent to favour boys has led to Indian parents abandoning babies in dumpsters, hedges, train tracks and even rivers or lakes where few of them survive.But they can now make a more humane choice. Offering a solution to hapless parents who are unable to bring up their newborns, the women and child development (WCD) ministry will now keep cradles at government hospitals, orphanages and police stations across the country where one can leave their child behind for adoption. The cradle will be accompanied by a bell, which a person can ring to notify authorities at the premises after dropping off a baby.""It is a simple, humane and anonymous method for parents who are unable to look after their child and have to unwillingly part ways with them,"" WCD minister Maneka Gandhi told Mail Today. ""By leaving their child behind in a cradle, parents will knowingly put their child up for adoption.""TO FILL THE GAPThe move came after the ministry found it difficult to bridge the gap between 600 kids up for adoption and 14,000 requests. The department's statutory body, Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), functions as the nodal agency for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate adoptions in India as well as abroad.The government's decision also comes as a blessing for childless people and couples. ""This will prove to be a safe place for orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children,"" said a senior ministry official.After a hospital or orphanage is notified by the ringing bell, officials will take the child into custody and he or she will handed over to the area's child welfare committee. The panel will further screen the child and decide if the baby is fit for adoption.REASONS FOR ABANDONMENTThe reasons for abandonment vary: an unwed mother facing social stigma; parents unable to look after their child, often because it is mentally or physically ill; or simply not wanting a girl. The ""surrendered children"" fail to get registered under the adoption list and in the process bring down the number of children ideal for the purpose.The official added the ministry will prioritise adoption demands by single mothers as well as economically welloff mothers and women who are over child- bearing age. While critics argue it could create more problems than it solves, such as increase abandonment, other analysts maintain that forcing parents to keep unwanted children can lead to abuse and infanticide.The WCD ministry has identified private and government hospitals and orphanages as prime locations to place the cradles. Ministry officials are yet to place police stations in the same ambit, citing complications of taking care of infants at such spots and are awaiting the approval of ministry of home affairs for this.WCD ministry officials pointed out that the cradles will help eliminate the guilt and social pressure stifling parents. It will also aid the government in ensuring that a child goes to a family with a good house.Gandhi was inspired during her trip to a child care institution in Guwahati where she saw infants put up for adoption.

India defeat Pakistan to win Asian Snooker Championship,"India's leading cueist Pankaj Advani teamed up with Laxman Rawat to demolish Pakistan in the final of the Asian Team Snooker Championship on Wednesday.Advani drew first blood by putting on a sterling performance against Mohammad Bilal.After the Pakistani scored the first solitary point and benefited from a foul from Advani, the Indian bounced back to piece together a brilliant break of 83 to seal the first tie of the best-of-five final.India's fate was going to be determined by Advani's partner Rawat's form and he did not disappoint.He rose to the occasion to head towards what was to be his first major international title with a clinical 73 break to win the frame without allowing his opponent, Babar Masih to score a single point.To complete a whitewash the Indian pair needed to maintain their superlative performance in the doubles tie.However, the Pakistani duo responded well to pressure of being 0-2 down, knowing they needed to win this crucial tie to stay alive in the final. But it was Rawat who saved the day for India by scoring a 50 break just when they had a deficit of a similar margin.But a critical miss on the pink before starting with the colours, brought Masih back to the table, gifting him a regulation clearance of yellow to black. Given the kind of pressure that was resting on his shoulders to rescue Pakistan from the brink of defeat, he fumbled on the green and gave Advani an unintended snook.But the Indian ace was in no mood of leaving the table without getting the job done.

Doctors say abortion not possible for 10-yr-old rape victim,"Gynaecologists from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) have ruled out the possibility of aborting the nearly eight-month pregnancy of a 10-year-old rape victim. ?It will be just like delivering a baby,? said a senior gynaecologist from the premier government hospital, which was on Monday tasked by the Supreme Court with examining if the pregnancy can be terminated. As per SC directions, the PGIMER has constituted an eight-member committee that would formally check if the health of the girl and the child would be adversely affected if the pregnancy is allowed to extend to its full term up to delivery. HT interacted with some gynecologists from the PGIMER and also Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, to know their views. Almost all of them ruled out aborting the 30-week foetus due to medical reasons. A senior gynaecologist from GMCH-32 told HT, ?The baby cannot be aborted. They can go to any apex court or any hospital. The child has crossed the time to abort the baby.??Ten- to 12-year old children getting pregnant are rare cases. In the last five years, I have seen only two such cases; one mother was 10 and the other, 12,? said a PGIMER gynaecologist. She said that in both cases the babies were delivered safely via Caesarian (C-section). ?The mother is so fragile that she cannot bear the trauma of labour pain and natural delivery. We could not let the 10-year-old undergo so much pain; so in that case we conducted elective C-section, wherein delivery was done even before the labour pain began,? she added. When asked if C-section is safer than natural delivery among pregnant children, she said, ?So far, no study on that has been done.? About risk factors, she said, ?Surgically, the risk is as much as it is in any other surgery. But the pregnancy will be more complicated than that in adult women.?

101-yr-old becomes world's oldest skydiver by jumping 15k ft,"A D-day veteran who jumped 15,000ft from a plane has become the oldest person in the world to skydive ? at the age of 101 and 38 days. Bryson William Verdun Hayes, known as Verdun, broke the world record on Sunday, completing a tandem skydive with three generations of his family at an airfield in Honiton, Devon. As he touched down, the former Royal Signals lance corporal said ?hooray? and added that he was feeling ?absolutely over the moon? at completing the challenge.The great-grandfather tried skydiving for the first time when he reached 100, but breaking the British record for the oldest skydiver was not enough for him. Hayes, who said a parachute jump was something he had wanted to do since he turned 90 ? but was talked out of it by his wife, who has since died ? was determined to take the world record and beat its previous holder, Canadian Armand Gendreau who skydived in June 2013 aged 101 and three days. Asked how he was feeling before Sunday?s jump, Hayes replied with a stoic ?all right? and said he was looking forward to the experience. He took to the skies with 10 members of his family at Skydive Buzz in Dunkeswell, all raising money for the Royal British Legion. The youngest skydiver was Stanley, 16, Hayes? great-grandson, while his grandson Roger, 50, son Bryan, 74, and great-granddaughter Ellie, 21, were also among those who took the leap. Ahead of the skydive, his daughter, Lin Tattersall, said: ?He?s made up his own mind that he wants to do it again, and I am extremely proud of the reasoning behind it.? Hayes, from Croyde, Devon, served in the army during the second world war and was presented with a Légion d?honneur for his heroic actions in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and in Normandy, France. He was named Verdun after his father, Joseph Hayes, who served in the first world war as a sapper with the Royal Engineers and who fought during the Battle of the Somme, wrote home to his pregnant wife, Mary, from the frontline suggesting they call their child Verdun after the 1916 battle. Hayes served as a signaller and wireless operator for the Royal Signals during the second world war. He returned to Normandy in 2016 as a beneficiary of the Royal British Legion?s Remembrance Travel arm. During the war, Hayes sustained shrapnel injuries to his ribs and hands in an explosion that killed his friend, Sgt Edgar Robertson. He said: ?How I came home from world war two I do not know. I was so near to the edge of everything. I lost any amount of friends in no time at all really. I just didn?t think I would ever return home.? A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said Hayes would be celebrating with a glass of champagne. He said: ?We are very proud of Verdun?s achievements and his family?s support for the Royal British Legion and the money raised recognises the service and sacrifice made across all generations of the British armed forces. ?The money raised will help support individuals and families from across the generations of our armed forces community.? Members of the family have separate online donation pages but Hayes, who hoped to raise £1,000, has already beaten his target and the current total on Virgin Money Giving stands at more than £1,600.",world,3216,60,70

Now, NASA plans to launch the Solar Probe Plus mission to the Sun which is about 149 million kilometres from the Earth. ""This is going to be our first mission to fly to the Sun,"" said Eric Christian, a NASA research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Centre. ""We cant get to the very surface of the Sun,"" but the mission will get close enough to answer three important questions, Christian said. First, the mission will hopefully unveil why the surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is not as hot as its atmosphere, called the corona. According to NASA, the surface temperature of the Sun is only about 5,500 degrees Celsius. However, the atmosphere above it is a sizzling two million degrees Celsius. ""You would think the farther away you get from a heat source, you would get colder. Why the atmosphere is hotter than the surface is a big puzzle,"" Christian said. The scientists also want to know how solar wind gets its speed, Live Science reported. ""The Sun blows a stream of charged particles in all directions at a million miles an hour. But we do not understand how that gets accelerated,"" he said.",science,1385,49,70

Daman & Diu revokes mandatory Rakshabandhan in offices order,"The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7.

The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers.

Railways asked to pay ?30K to family which couldn't use loo,"The inability of Indian Railways' to stop unauthorised crowd occupying reserved seats of a train has cost it a sum of Rs 30,000 as a compensation to a family which could not use washrooms for more than an hour an half as the passage to the toilet was blocked.

SDMC to hire monkey catchers on contract for ?18k salary,"Struggling to find people willing to work as monkey catchers, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to hire them on contract. At present, the civic agency has only one staff for catching and relocating hundreds of monkeys roaming in 104 wards. Due to manpower shortage, it could catch only 15 monkeys in the last one year, said an SDMC official. Now, the corporation proposes to pay them a regular salary, even if they don?t catch any monkey. So far, SDMC pays Rs1,200 for catching and relocation of one monkey.?We are waiting for the financial approval and possibly by next week we will start the tendering process for hiring monkey catchers at a monthly salary of ?18,000. That?s the last thing we can do to attract monkey catchers,? said a senior SDMC official. For the past three years, the corporation has written letters to the state governments asking for help in procuring services of monkey catchers. ?We wrote to different states corporations such as Haryana, UP, HP and Andhra Pradesh for providing monkey catchers but failed to get any reply,? said RBS Tyagi, director veterinary department, SDMC.According to him, there are multiple reasons responsible for existing shortage of workforce.?The monkeys are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They are looked after by the wildlife department after they?re relocated at the Asola Bhatti Mines Sanctuary. So ideally it should be the department?s responsibility to catch the monkeys,? said Tyagi.The SDMC claimed it shared the facts with the wildlife department and but didn?t get any reply. ?Except for Rajasthan, no other state corporations are catching monkeys,? said a senior SDMC official. SDMC will soon file an affidavit in the Delhi high court, asking that the responsibility of catching and relocating monkeys be shifted to the Delhi government?s wildlife department.Officials said that the monkeys that are relocated to the forest of Asola Bhatti mines are coming back to the residential areas in search of food. ?We have received complaints from neighbouring schools, dispensaries and residential areas about simians coming in groups to steal food from people?s houses and attack them. But we are helpless,? said a senior official. Besides, the animal lovers also add to the problem by filing police complaints against corporations and monkey catchers when the simians are caught in ones and twos, not troops.?Such an incident happened in Nizamuddin and our staff was harassed unnecessarily. In fact, it is a major reason why monkey catchers don?t want to work in Delhi,? said an official.",general,2587,56,70

(Hindustan Times) Here?s what these celebs have to say:Tapsee Pannu: We are a colour-obsessed nation selling fairness creams in high volumes. Our matrimonial columns till date have a mention of skin colour. So let?s not target only the film industry.Nandita Das: I am sure it is no surprise to anyone that Nawazuddin?s skin colour would have impeded his career. All around us the images of women and now increasingly of men, are those with light skin. Be it films, television, magazines, hoardings, ads... Everywhere we have ?fair? people, in a country that is largely dark! Every skin care product has a skin lightening element. Dark skinned people are often made to feel inadequate... right from their childhood. I can see the challenges that Nawazuddin must have faced in his career. After he has been around for over 10 years, it is his sheer talent and perseverance that has made him overcome this prejudice.Anshuman Jha: ?I am offered unconventional roles. But I personally haven?t faced any racism in this industry. But this industry is all about how good you look, and therefore discrimination is bound to exist. In the West, the black American actor Jamie Foxx can be paired opposite any leading lady. Here the criterion for casting is how compatible he or she looks with the other actor instead of performing abilities.Tannishtha Chatterjee: ?I think the film industry is not so colour biased. Such colour biases exist more in the advertising industry. Our society at large still suffers from these prejudices. Artistes and art need to speak up against societal prejudice. I?ve never endorsed fairness creams. I?ve never allowed anyone to make me look fair on screen. Pankaj Tripathi: Racism is part of the Indian mindset. We can?t escape it.

The film is a biopic on gangster Dawood Ibrahim?s sister, who is also known as ?Queen of Mumbai?.Manoj Desai, executive director of Maratha Mandir Cinema, said the makers of the film thought of launching the trailer there as Parkar lived in Dongri, which is very close to Maratha Mandir.

SC appoints 9-judge bench to decide on Right to Privacy,"Is the right to privacy a fundamental right?The question, which forms the basis of petitions that challenge Aadhaar for violating privacy, will be answered by a nine-judge constitution bench.The Supreme Court in Tuesday said the constitution bench would revisit its rulings that said the right to privacy was not a fundamental right and then hear petitions against the 12-digit biometric identity number.?During the course of hearing today it has become essential for us to determine whether right to privacy is a fundamental right under the Constitution,? a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said.The nine-judge bench is expected to take up and conclude its hearing on Wednesday itself.?The determination of this question would essentially entail whether the decision recorded by an eight-judge bench in 1954 and also by a six-judge bench in 1962 that there is no such fundamental right is the correct expression of constitutional provisions,? the court said.The court decided to refer the matter to a larger bench after the Centre cited the two judgments to argue that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right.?Our founding fathers have encompassed all rights.

But justice J Chelameswar said it was illogical to argue that the Constitution didn?t mention the right to privacy while common law identified it.?Textually it is correct today that there is no right to privacy in the Constitution.

Speeding major cause of accidents in Gurugram: Police,"Speeding, driving in the wrong lane, and suddenly crossing the road, often by pedestrians, have emerged as three major reasons for road mishaps in Gurgaon, according to an analysis of around 200 accidents by the city police.A comparison of accident figures in the first half of 2016 and 2017 also revealed a slight dip in the number of accidents in 2017.In the first half of 2016, there had been 605 accidents and 218 deaths on Gurgaon?s roads.?For the corresponding period in 2017, there have been 572 accidents with 213 casualties. The number of people seriously injured in accidents during this period stood at 627 last year and is 585 this year.Gurgaon police commissioner, Sandeep Khirwar, said managing traffic and preventing accidents were two key challenges for his department.?New experiments and changes in traffic movement are being carried out to find a viable solution to these problems. Several drives against speeding, unauthorised parking and drink driving have helped in improving the situation,? he said.Of the 199 accidents analysed by the Gurgaon police, 70 were caused due to speeding.Driving on the wrong lane of the road, in opposite direction of traffic, is often seen on city roads, including the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, which is an access-controlled road. According to the data, 22 accidents were caused by driving in the wrong lane and 28 because someone suddenly rushed on to the road.Further, in the sample studied, being negligent or drowsy while driving was found to be the cause of 17 accidents. Fourteen were due to overtaking a vehicle from the left and 10 each due to the vehicle in front applying brakes suddenly and due to vehicles taking a sudden U-turn.Transport experts, however, termed these incidents as crashes and not accidents and held bad road engineering and poor planning responsible for these road mishaps, which they said were preventable.?Most of the roads in Gurgaon are designed for high-speed movement of vehicles at 70 to 80 km per hour. There is also a tendency among planners to not create U-turns while building roads, leading to people driving on the wrong side to reach their destination instead of driving an extra distance to take a turn,? said Amit Bhatt, a transport expert, adding that lack of enforcement of rules was also responsible.According to experts, planning and execution of roads has to be done as per the specific requirements of the city instead of building highways that they said are unnecessary.",general,2477,53,70
Delhi govt adds 100 new GPS-enabled buses,"In a step towards improving the public transport in the city, the Delhi government has added 100 new GPS-enabled buses in its fleet and plans to add 250 more during the next two months and 450 AC buses this year.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia flagged off new buses outside the Delhi Secretariat. The induction of 100 new cluster buses will facilitate connectivity for commuters in the Capital, he said. ?The new cluster buses are GPS-enabled and comfortable. We are also developing 31 new bus depots and are awaiting approval from DDA in this regard,? transport minister Satyendar Jain said.A plan is also being processed to facilitate a multilevel parking at bus depots to ease traffic congestion and parking woes, he added.The buses have mobile charging sockets. (Raj K Raj/Hindustan Times) According to KK Dahiya, special transport commissioner, ?Approximately 20 acre land is being utilised in Bawana and Narela to develop new bus depots that will have multilevel parking.?Besides urban specifications and safety tests, the buses are fitted with 41 ?anti-vandalism? seats (that won?t come off easily) and have a better seating arrangement to ensure the comfort of passengers.With the addition of 100 buses, the cluster fleet strength has risen to 1,725. They will be largely catering to north, east and west Delhi on eight additional cluster routes. Additional buses will not only boost public transport, but will also help take at least 5,000-6,000 cars off the city roads.Digital ticket systems have been installed in the 100 new cluster buses. (Raj K Raj/Hindustan Times) In their first budget, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had promised to induct 10,000 more buses in five years while in the manifesto, the promise was to add 5,000 buses. In its second budget presented last year, the government said it would procure 1,000 new low floor non-AC buses, 1,000 under the cluster bus scheme and another 1,000 under a new premium category during 2016-17.However, not a single bus has been added to the low-floor fleet and only 215 have been added under the cluster scheme. The plan for premium buses did not materialise as the L-G asked the government to rework on the proposal.Data show that bus fleet has reduced by over 35% in the last six years. Delhi Transport Corporation, which used to operate 6,204 buses in 2010-11, is operating only 4,020 buses due to which ridership has also reduced considerably. Only 21.80% Delhi commutes by buses, but the share of buses among all registered vehicles in Delhi has gone down from 1.52% in 1980-81 to less than 0.36% now.

The buses will be able to seat 42 people, more than DTC?s 35-seater low floor buses. ?The fares will be charged through electronic ticketing machines,? said an official.In September, the government inducted 100 buses under the cluster fleet.

""The GST Council is not the Centre. It has 31 states and the Centre as members. We are not the one to take the final call.""With regard to Jammu and Kashmir, where enabling GST law has not been passed by the Assembly, Jaitley said, the delay is due to Article 370, which a is reality and the politics of the state. Some people are saying that GST will lead to more integration with the rest of the country.Jaitley said that he has written a letter to Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti highlighting the losses that Jammu and Kashmir and people of the state will suffer for not implementing GST.Jammu and Kashmir consumers will have to pay taxes twice. The products will be costlier in Jammu and Kashmir. The Jammu and Kashmir government can't claim compensation for the loss of revenue. If the manufacturer in Jammu and Kashmir tries to sell products outside the state, they will have to pay taxes twice.Jaitley also slammed West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for not passing a law for implementing GST. He said, all the states and political parties should take one clear stand on GST. They can be either with it or against it. They supported GST in the Council but are not with it in the state.On the question of keeping petroleum and real estate out of the purview of GST, Jaitley said, the new amendment has brought petroleum under its ambit. He also said that petroleum is at present zero-rated under the GST. The GST Council has to take a decision about petroleum. The decision will be taken sooner than later, Jaitley said.On real estate, Jailtey said, this sector will also be brought under the GST. There is lot of tax evasion in real estate sector.

World XI to play four T20 matches against Pakistan in Lahore,"The International Cricket Council is planning to send a World XI to Pakistan in late September for a four-match Twenty20 series in Lahore that will look to build on the successful staging of the Pakistan Super League final in the city on Sunday.The four-match series at the Gaddafi Stadium ? to be called The Independence Cup to mark the 70th anniversary of partition ? is intended to continue the reintroduction of top-level cricket to the country after a near eight-year hiatus. The break resulted from the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009 and has meant Pakistan, bar one series against Zimbabwe two years ago, have played home internationals at neutral venues.Details of which players will feature in the World XI are yet to be established. Six overseas cricketers ? including Kevin Pietersen, Luke Wright and Tymal Mills ? withdrew from Sunday?s PSL final following the tournament?s switch from the United Arab Emirates and in light of two bomb blasts in the preceding weeks.England?s Chris Jordan and the Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan, along with the former West Indies captain Darren Sammy, were among the eight who travelled as, amid a military-style security operation that saw the city in lockdown and bulletproof team buses escorted by elite troops, the match passed without incident. Peshawar Zalmi beat Quetta Gladiators by 58 runs.Giles Clarke, the president of the England and Wales Cricket Board, heads the ICC?s Pakistan Task Force that has been looking at ways to end a drought of international cricket and stated the PSL final, while not simply a test run for the World XI series in itself, has shown cricket can be staged in Lahore.?The desire is to give the cricket-starved Pakistani supporters the chance to see some of the world?s finest players in live action,? Clarke said. ?The world of cricket needs to help Pakistan, who cannot continue to play their home fixtures overseas. The youth need inspiring, and the national teams need far more cricket played in familiar terrain. Furthermore, the terrorists cannot win and cricket must not give up on Pakistan.?The World XI series overseas team will assemble in Dubai on 17 September, before flying to Lahore for four matches on the 22nd, 23rd, 28th and 29th, and follow a similar security plan to the PSL final, the rehearsals for which were overseen by an ICC delegation who included the ECB?s security director, Reg Dickason.Malan, speaking before playing Sunday?s final, said he made himself available after being talked through the security plans and following guarantees over player and spectator safety. ?As soon as they brought out how tough it would be to get to the players, I almost felt it was my duty to come and represent the team and do the right thing by them,? he said. ?Despite all the concerns that there have been in Pakistan, there has been an initiative to try to bring top-class cricket back to the country.?",sports,2910,60,70

Court convicts school authorities for traumatising 7 yr old,"In an unprecedented verdict, a Delhi court on Wednesday awarded a two-month jail term to a school principal and its director for causing mental trauma to a 7-year-old girl by not allowing her to enter the classroom. Kavita Chandra was the then director and Romi Chawla was the then principal of Dwarka-based OPG World School, where the incident took place on April 24, 2012. Both have been directed to pay a compensation of R 2.5 lakh each to the girl. ?For five long years, my daughter was traumatised and wondered what her fault was. The incident happened when she was in class 3 and admissions were closed in other schools. It took us over two months to find another school, and my child remained at home all this while for no fault of hers,? the girl?s father told Hindustan Times. Stating that the act of not allowing the child to sit in the classroom amounts to wilful neglect, the court had in June this year convicted Chandra and Chawla under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. The girl?s father had complained that his daughter was ill treated and confined by the school management throughout the school hours on April 24, 2012, in order to pressurise him to withdraw her from school. He said that instead of keeping her in the class with her classmates, she was wrongly confined to various other places in the school where neither children were present nor any activity was going on. He claimed that she was not even sent to dining hall to have a breakfast and lunch with her classmates. During her cross examination in the court, the girl had said that she was told by her class teacher that the director and principal had given instructions to not allow her to sit in the classroom. During the course of investigation, the director and the principal had said that a transfer certificate was issued on April 23, 2012 on the request of the girl?s parents. However, instead of collecting the transfer certificate, the child was sent to the school. They said that since the girl was not feeling comfortable on arrival at the school and knowing her past history of asthma, she was sent to infirmary for rest. The school had requested the parents to pick her up and collect the transfer certificate.However, the girl?s father said that he had raised questions against the arbitrary increase in school fees and accessory charges, after which the school management sought to evict his daughter with a transfer certificate. ?I had already paid the school fees in advance and so I refused to accept the transfer certificate. I told them that I will transfer her only after finding another school. But still the management prevented my daughter from attending her classes,? said the girl?s father. In its judgment, the court said that whatever may be the differences with the parents, the school authorities could not have allowed the child to be neglected. It further said that the child cannot be thrown out at the whim and fancies of the school authorities.The girl?s father said that he ran from pillar to post to get justice for her daughter, who is now 12-years-old. She is one of the top performers in her new school. ENDS",general,3175,59,70

Mumbai University results to be out by August after delays,"After weeks of speculation, University of Mumbai officials said they hope to announce the results of major examinations conducted earlier this year, by second week of August. While they said they were happy with the pace at which papers were being assessed over the past few weeks, teachers are still complaining about technical glitches delaying the result.?Many teachers are still complaining that they receive answer booklets in Marathi instead of English. Though teachers are entitled to evaluating the answer sheets of three papers, some have only got the requisite codes for one. Even if they want a larger share of the workload, they cannot do it. Such glitches are hindering us from speeding up the process,? said the principal of a suburban college, who did not wish to be identified. He added that even with new central assessment process (CAP) centres being set up across the city, teachers are still finding it difficult to finish assessment work.MU is still receiving complaints from teachers, who said network problems are affecting the basic uploading of answer booklets daily. ?On some days, evaluating a single answer booklet can take up to an hour. Each page takes several minutes to upload, and only then can I assess them. It is frustrating,? said a professor, who did not wish to be identified. She said most teachers are still trying to work around these problems just to ensure that results are announced soon.Earlier this month, governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao had ordered MU to announce all results by July 31. However, this now seems unlikely. ?Assessment work is going on well and we hope to announce the results of various courses by the end of this month. The results of courses which a large number of students have opted for will be announced a week later,? said an MU official.",general,1806,58,70
3 top AIIMS professors resigned in 6 months over poor salary,"The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the country's premier institute in the field of medicine, is finding it difficult to retain talent. Three top professors have left the faculty for greener pastures over the last six months, a development which insiders say is unprecedented in AIIMS history.Dr BS Sharma, senior professor from neuro-surgery, who was a member of AIIMS faculty for more than 25 years, has joined a private medical institute in Jaipur while another professor from the department, Dr Sumit Sinha has moved to Paras Hospitals, a super speciality medicare chain. Dr Sinha served AIIMS for over a decade. The third one to leave is Dr Pravash Mishra from hematology department, who has joined Max Healthcare.""The migration of faculty has severely affected key areas of healthcare like liver transplantation services, renal transplantation, high quality paediatric medicine and general medicine services,"" noted the Faculty Association of AIIMS (FAAIIMS) in a letter sent to director Randeep Guleria on July 25. Mail Today has a copy of the letter.The FAAIIMS has also sent their demands to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union health minister JP Nadda, requesting them to take action to stem the migration.Reacting to the issue and the letter sent to health ministry, Union health secretary CK Mishra said, ""AIIMS doctors get salaries which is very different from other government hospitals. However, the ministry is looking into the matter.""FIRST TIME""It has never happened in the history of AIIMS,"" a senior faculty member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Mail Today.""These top doctors are migrating from AIIMS as they are not getting appropriate salaries, suitable accommodation and have administrative issues. The worrying part is that in some of the departments where the faculty faces the brain drain, the waiting list of patients stretches till 2019-2020.""""Not just the veteran but even the younger faculty is getting distraught with the functioning of the institution.""In last three years, approximately 17 young faculty members have resigned because of poor salary and non-availability of accommodation,"" the faculty member said.The FAAIIMS letter also points out that senior most faculty members ""get no promotion for 15 to 20 years"". This translates into static or slow raise in their incomes.""An assistant professor's existing pay band and grade pay is Rs 15,600-39,100 with minimum scale of Rs 30,000.""Suppose, this pay-band gets him a take-home amount of Rs 1 lakh. If the same doctor applies to a private institution, particularly with AIIMS experience, he is likely to get three times of his current pay. Why would he stay on?""NEW PAY BANDS""We want that the new faculty which is coming should be given pay band 4 so that they straightway come to the new level 13. With this, AIIMS can attract bright faculty for the future,"" said another senior member of AIIMS faculty.The Seventh Pay Commission recommendations are yet to be implemented for the AIIMS faculty. At present, it has been enforced only for staff group B, C and D.In February this year, a committee was formed for the implementation of revised pay rules and the matter was discussed that pay scale should be made higher and new allowances should be given to the faculty.ALSO READ |",general,3303,60,70
Dangal's Dhaakad video was a gift for Aamir: Chinese fan,"If the roaring success of Aamir Khan?s Dangal in China ? the film has made more than Rs 1,000 crore in that country ? wasn?t proof enough of how much the Chinese love the Bollywood star and his latest film, here is some more proof: a video made by Aamir?s Chinese fan club based on the hit song Dhaakad from Dangal.The video, uploaded by Aamir Khan FC?China, hit the Internet on July 5 and crossed 2,50,000 views within days of being uploaded. The video shows various groups of superfans from across China dancing to Dhaakad. So, what inspired this fan video? We chatted with Wenjing Zhang aka Viki from the fan club, who explained that it was made as a gift for Aamir Khan for his great movie and unmatched acting prowess in it. ?Aamirji?s PK?(2014) grossed over 100 crore [rupees] in China, so we were expecting Dangal to at least earn double. But then, the movie made 1,300 crore here, which was a complete surprise. We were really excited as fans and decided to make something as a gift or a memento for him. And, that is how we came up with the idea of a video,? says Viki.Chinese fan Wenjing Zhang aka Viki with her idol, actor Aamir Khan.The Chinese were moved by the film?s family ties. A lot of Chinese kids are pushed by their parents to learn things that they don?t really like when they are small, but when they grow up, they realise that the parents were right in doing so. I guess, many people could relate to that feeling, too ? Wenjing Zhang aka VikiShe further explained that it was the social position of the girls in the movie and the portrayal of family bonds that made the movie so relatable for viewers in China.?The Chinese were moved by the film?s family ties. A lot of Chinese kids are pushed by their parents to learn things that they don?t really like when they are small, but when they grow up, they realise that the parents were right in doing so. I guess, many people could relate to that feeling, too,? says Viki. ?We chose the song Dhaakad, because Aamirji has sung it (the actor has made his own video version, which is not seen in the film), and he is really cool in the movie, too.? The fan video required quite a lot of teamwork. Viki says, ?Five teams from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Xi?an shot individual videos, which were later compiled into one by me. The teams from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu had even met Aamir sir, when he had come for promotions,? she adds.What really went into the making of the video, you ask? Viki says that none of the team members are actually dancers. They simply planned the video within a week?s time, shot it in two days and then compiled it all together. ?We chose moves like Aamirji and a few that would give the feel of the movie (like imitating some of the scenes where two wrestlers face each other). The video was shot at major landmarks such as Guangzhou Circle (a round building), Temple of Heaven in Beijing, Shanghai World Expo, National Museum of China, and Great Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi?an. The pagoda in Xi?an was also chosen because it has a connection with India, too,? she says.The Great Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi?an, one of the places where the fan video was shot.Meeting Aamir Khan himself during the promotional tour was a dream come true for Viki. She says that she felt really lucky to have met the star in person and found him to be a great human being. Viki, along with her team, also decided to translate Satyamev Jayate (a show hosted by Aamir Khan) and even got his approval for it. ?We love his show and wanted to share his thoughts with more people. We told him about our plan to translate it for the Chinese people and he actually took out time to reply to us. He wanted us to finish it and to do a good job with it. I want him to know that we have now completed the translation and there is no mistake in it. His Chinese fans love it,? she says.

Skin patch that could charge mobiles using sweat developed,"Los Angeles, Jun 23 (PTI) Scientists have created a skin patch that can power a radio for two days using human sweat, and may eventually be used to charge mobile devices while people are out for a run. The bio fuel patch may also provide a way to monitor glucose levels in people with diabetes, without needles and blood samples, researchers said. The skin patch developed by researchers from University of California, San Diego in the US is a flexible square just a couple of centimetres across and sticks to the skin. It contains enzymes that replace the precious metals normally used in batteries and uses sweat to provide power. Getting enough power out of a bio fuel cell to make it useful has proved tricky, but the latest version can extract 10 times more than before, researchers said. ""We are now getting really impressive power levels. If you were out for a run, you would be able to power a mobile device,"" said Joseph Wang from the University of California, San Diego.

Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport: Aus media,"The Australian media has made a scathing accusation on India captain Virat Kohli of being ""completely untouchable"" and ""a law unto himself"". The Daily Telegraph compared Kohli to the United States President Donald Trump, saying ""Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport"".This comes after Kohli accused the Australian players of trolling Team India physio Patrick Farhart during the Ranchi Test.""They (four-five of them) started taking Patrick's name. I don't know why. He's our physio. His job is to treat me. I don't find the reason behind it. I could not understand. You must ask why they have started taking his name,"" Kohli said. While saving a run on the first day of the third Test, Kohli hurt his right shoulder and Farhart rushed onto the field to attain to his injury. Kohli eventually left the field with the physio and was back in action only on the third day.Later, Glenn Maxwell was seen mocking Kohli's injury when he imitated his action by clutching his right shoulder after his dive to save a boundary. The Indian skipper, too, gave it back with a similar gesture when David Warner got out in Australia's second innings.However, Smith insisted that they never disrespected Farhart, who himself is an Australian.""Virat was having a go at me out in the middle and saying how I was disrespecting Patrick Farhart when actually it was the exact opposite. If I was to do anything, (I was inferring) he did a pretty terrific job to get Virat back on the field after that shoulder,"" Smith said.DRS SAGAThe Kohli-Smith quarrel started in Bengaluru over a DRS incident when the Australian captain was caught seeking help from his team's dressing room over a review after he was trapped leg before by Umesh Yadav.While Smith called it a ""brain fade"", Kohli warned the visitors of ""crossing the line"". International Cricket Council put an end to the saga by not pressing charges against Smith or Kohli.""Test captains, under the rules of the game, are supposed to be the flagbearers for upholding the spirit of the game, yet the ICC has allowed the Indian captain to destroy one of the foundations on which the game has been played for more than a century,"" The Daily Telegraph wrote.""The fact Kohli has not been sanctioned for calling the Australians systematic cheats or his latest unfounded attack on Smith shows that he is completely untouchable.""""The ICC won't fine him. Not even the BCCI, who through their broadcaster apologised to Smith, can get their skipper to tow the party line.""'KOHLI DISRESPECTS GAME'The report further compared Kohli to Arjuna Ranatunga for showing no respect to his opponent.""Like former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, Kohli relies on a flagrant disrespect of his opponents and the game to fuel himself and his team.Soft cricketing administrators have given rise to a bat-wielding Trump.""'KOHLI, AUSTRALIA'S NO.1 ENEMY'There's no doubt that Australian fans hate Kohli.

Pak's ISI behind Kabul blast which killed 90: Afghanistan,"Afghanistan has blamed Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the banned terror group - the Haqqani network - for Wednesday's deadly bomb blast in Kabul's diplomatic area which killed at least 90 people and injured 300 others.Talking exclusively to India Today, Afghanistan Interior Ministry spokesperson Sediq Siddiqui said role of Pakistan's ISI has been established in Kabul explosion. ""We have nailed Pakistan's ISI role (in Kabul blast). Afghanistan expects Pakistan to crack down on Haqqani network. The attack will surely impact ties between the two (Afghanistan, Pakistan) countries,"" Siddiqui told India Today. He added that Kabul expects Islamabad to act against the Haqqani network while expressing fears of more such attacks in the country.India and Pakistan both are victims of Pakistan sponsored terror, Siddiqui added. The Haqqani Network is an Afghan insurgent terror outfit based in Pakistan's Waziristan and has carried out many high-profile attacks on US forces, high ranking Afghan officials and foreigners in Afghanistan. The network has ties with Taliban and Al Qaeda and the US considers it a major threat to Afghanistan's stability.KABUL ATTACK Kabul's high-security diplomatic zone was rocked by a powerful blast on Wednesday morning. The explosion occurred near the German embassy at one of the entrances to Kabul's unofficial Green Zone.While the sewage tanker carrying the bomb was stopped from entering the zone, it was unclear how such a large quantity of explosives could get through the ring of checkpoints set up around Kabul to protect the capital.A huge crater ripped into the ground at the site of the blast and shattered windows in houses more than a kilometre away were testament to the power of the explosion, which was set off by a bomb concealed in the tanker.In scale, it was one of the worst such attacks since the US-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001 but in kind, it was only the latest in a grim series that has killed thousands of civilians over the years.(With inputs from Reuters) ALSO READ:Kabul bomb blast death toll hits 80, over 350 others injured in suicide attack near Indian embassy",general,2155,57,70

I-T dept recovers ?5 cr from K'taka Min hosting Gujarat MLAs,"Tax officials raided on Wednesday multiple properties linked to DK Shivakumar, a top minister in Karnataka who is hosting a group of party legislators from Gujarat to avoid a break in their ranks ahead of a close Rajya Sabha election.Tax officers raided 64 places in Delhi and Karnataka linked to energy minister Shivakumar as part of investigations into his alleged tax evasion and dodgy investments in real estate. The move triggered an angry response from the Congress, which accused the BJP of carrying out ?an unprecedented witch-hunt?. Party leaders raised the matter in parliament, protesting noisily and forcing multiple adjournments in the Rajya Sabha. In Lok Sabha, the party also staged a walkout.The Congress has accused the BJP of using ?money and muscle power? to engineer defections among its legislators in Gujarat, where senior party leader Ahmed Patel is seeking re-election to the Rajya Sabha, on August 8.But the government said the ?Eagleton ? The Golf Village?, where the Gujarat legislators were camping, had not been raided. Finance minister Arun Jaitley told Parliament that only Shivakumar, who was trying to ?hide behind the cover? of the lawmakers at the resort, had been taken for questioning.Jaitley told the Lok Sabha that tax officials found that Shivakumar was tearing up documents at the resort. ?We recovered those papers as well,? he said.As the Congress accused the government of using its agencies such as CBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax to target the opposition leaders, Jaitley said, ?Whether it is a use or abuse, it depends on recovery (from the raids).?Last week, the Congress flew 42 legislators to a resort on the outskirts of the capital of Karnataka, where the party is in power, to keep the flock together. Six of its legislators have quit the party and three of them crossed over to the BJP. More defections can jeopardise Patel?s chances of re-election.Party spokesman and Gujarat MLA Shaktisinh Gohil contradicted the BJP, saying tax officials entered their resort. Ashok Gehlot, Congress? Gujarat in-charge, said: ?Our MLAs are being threatened, money was offered and raids are being conducted.?His party colleague Anand Sharma said: ?There is a trend now of abusing state power and agencies of the state. The timing is important and significant.

Stars look their best even if tackling hell within: Sridevi,"Actor Sridevi?s has been one of the most enduring careers in Indian cinema, spanning Bollywood and regional film industries.

Since being a star is still a lot about one?s appearance, Sridevi says that it?s not an easy task for female actors to consistently maintain standards of perfection. They?re always under pressure to look good, even when they?re not on camera, she says. That pressure has only been increased by the age of social media.?If the actor is being herself, tired , with just a bun on and posts a picture on social media, then the comments will come. So many comments such as ?what is she looking like?, ?what chappal is she wearing?. Then as an actor you feel ,why give a chance to anyone to do that. You better look your best, even if you are going through hell inside,? says Sridevi, whose performance in her recently released film Mom has garnered appreciation.As for herself, Sridevi says that she managed to steer her career while keeping the pressures at bay. She enjoyed being a leading lady ? ?I got to wear different clothes, I got to do the best roles.? And she didn?t let box office numbers kill her sleep. ?If the picture does well, I?m surprised and happy; and if it doesn?t do well, then it?s part of your profession.

Maharashtra government to buy chopper for VIPs,"The new helicopter that the state plans to buy for its VIPs is likely to cost nearly Rs90 crore and may take at least a year to be delivered. While procuring the chopper will take four months, the bidding process before and registration after it will lengthen the procedure, said an official.A committee headed by chief secretary Sumeet Mullick decided to speed up the process on Wednesday. Its decision comes two weeks after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis escaped a potential chopper accident while returning from Alibaug.During a meeting at Mantralaya, the committee endorsed a decision to suspend the chopper?s operations during the monsoon. It also decided to dispose of a grounded helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft as soon as possible.The state will appoint a pilot and co-pilot for its only aircraft in service ? a Cessna Citation 560 XLS ? for VIPs.?We will call for global tenders to buy a chopper. It is likely to be a modern make of Sikorki S76 or Bell. The state favours the advanced make of Sikorki S76, which was grounded after it crash-landed in Latur in May. Reports revealed that its sturdiness helped the pilot avoid further damage,? said an official. The state expects about Rs15 crore to be recovered from the Sikorki S76?s insurance cover. After a failed attempt to dispose of the Beechcraft Super King Air 350 and Eurocopter AS 365 Dauphin, the state has decided to relax norms to ensure their speedy disposal.",politics,1435,46,70

"Man found dead at Delhi police station, kin allege foul play","An alleged suspect in a kidnapping case was found hanging inside the washroom of the Jahangirpuri police station in north Delhi on Wednesday, hours after he was called by the cops for interrogation.The police claimed it was an ?unprovoked suicide? and denied use of force. An internal inquiry as well as a magisterial probe is in process, police said. The relatives of the deceased suspect foul play in the death.The dead man is 32-year-old Raj Kumar. A native of Kasganj in UP, Kumar was unmarried and worked as a security guard at a government school in Pitampura till a few months ago.?During his stint at that school, he entered into a relationship with a married woman who worked as a peon. Their relationship ended a few months ago and Kumar quit the job and returned to his village,? said a police officer.The woman went missing a few months ago, prompting her husband to file a police complaint and a habeas corpus petition at the Delhi High Court.?The woman?s husband suspected five-six persons. Kumar was one of them,? said the officer.

Sectarian attacks in India might help al-Qaeda: US expert,"By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jul 15 (PTI) Rising sectarian attacks in India might help drive support to al-Qaeda, a top US expert has told lawmakers, noting that the terror group is trying to reassert itself in the Indian subcontinent. ""Rising sectarian attacks in India might help drive support to al-Qaida,"" Katherine Zimmerman, research fellow, American Enterprise Institute, a top American think-tank, told members of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence during a Congressional hearing on al-Qaida threat. ""Al-Qaeda reconsolidated in the Maghreb and Sahel after the rise of ISIS. It remains embedded in the insurgencies, and it is looking to reassert itself in the Indian subcontinent through Punjab,"" she said. ""The senior leadership is no longer concentrated in Afghanistan-Pakistan, nor is it synonymous with what the Obama administration once dubbed al-Qaida core. Al-Qaidas senior leadership is found today in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond,"" Zimmerman said. ""The old leadership continues to provide strategic guidance, Ayman al-Zawahiri issues overall direction to the network, and leadership attrition has compelled al-Qaida to reveal a deeper bench than we knew it was there before,"" she said. Responding to questions, Zimmerman said it is important to closely monitor the situation in the Indian subcontinent, which is increasingly restive. ""Recognising that we have key interests in the broader stability of the region,"" she said. ""I think theres no question its a concern if you look at the increasing levels of violence that have been perpetrated by groups associated with al-Qaida in the Indian subcontinent, as well as ISIS in Bangladesh,"" said Seth Jones from the Rand Foundation in response to another question. ""We have a range of the conditions. Weve already talked about on this committee, on this panel, weak governance, economic challenges, opportunities for fighters, and its proximity to both Pakistan and Afghanistan active war zones that make Bangladesh of concern,"" he said.

"Shiv Sena not Hindutvavadi, pretends to be one: VHP","gains: VHP New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) today said NDA constituent Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. Speaking to reporters here, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said that merely chanting King Shivajis name does not make Shiv Sena a Hindutvavadi (one championing the Hindutva cause) party. ""I dont think Shiv Sena was ever a Hindutvavadi organisation. It is the media which gave this tag to Shiv Sena after Babri mosque was demolished,"" Jain said. ""It is pretending to be a Hindutuvavadi organisation for political gains,"" he added. His remark comes against the backdrop of stinging verbal exchanges between long-standing allies Shiv Sena and BJP leaders ahead of Maharashtra civic polls, voting for which was held today. Seeking to buttress his claim, the VHP leader stated late Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray himself was ""clueless"" about his party workers bringing portions of the mosque down in Uttar Pradeshs Ayodhya in 1992. ""He (Thackeray) himself had said he had no clue about it. But he said he was a proud man if his party men demolished the mosque. That one statement made them Hindutva champion...you dont become Hindutvavadi by merely chanting Chhatrapati Shivajis name,"" Jain claimed. Apparently referring to Shiv Senas sons-of-the-soil campaign in Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai, Jain said the party is rather a ""fissiparous"" force, which targeted its own Hindu brothers from south and north India for ""narrow benefits"" and does not understand broad concepts of Hindutva. ""When they talk about Hindutva...are Hindus from Tamil Nadu not Hindus? Whether Hindus from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are not Hindus? Even today, they are beaten there (in Mumbai).",general,1767,51,70

190-yr-old Mumbai temple to save ?8L by using solar power,"A 190-year-old Jain temple at Byculla is the latest addition to the growing list of religious and educational institutions and housing societies, who are harnessing solar energy for an eco-friendly future. Sheth Motisha Jain Temple, spread across two acres, installed a 37.5 kilo-watt (KW) power rooftop solar system with 115 panels earlier this month, which will help the management save Rs8 lakh on electricity bills annually. The system will power lights and fans along the pathways, bhojanalaya (mess), storerooms and guest accommodations for devotees. The trustees who took up the initiative claimed theirs was first temple in Byculla to which harnessed solar energy. ?With soaring temperatures, electricity consumption has increased. This electricity is generated at plants that use coal, gas or oil to generate electricity. The process releases harmful chemicals into the air and adds to the pollution,? said Kiranrajji Mangalilalji Shah, chairperson, Sheth Motisha Jain Religious and Charitable Trust. He added,?Each system has advantages and disadvantages, but renewable resources do not exploit any exhaustible resources. So we decided to rely on solar energy to produce electricity.? So far, about 20 religious institutions in the city have switched to solar power.Other trust members added that more panels will be installed by the year-end. ?The present installation is the first phase of the project. Our aim is to convert the entire campus into solar power zone. We are happy to give something back to the society and achieve our goal of maintaining an environmental balance,? said Jagdishchandra Chandulalji Mehta, managing trustee. The setup installed atop the building, which provides lodging facilities to devotees, on the temple premises on average generates 160 kilowatt hour (kWh) electricity per day. A Mumbai house with two bedrooms, on an average, uses 8 to 10 kWh electricity daily. ?We first want to test the system for three months before installing more panels in the phase II. During summers, the power generated is expected to be much more. We are using two German inverters to produce electricity in the first phase,? said Partth Kothari, company partner, Appsolar LLP, a private company that installed the project. The trust has also installed a net-metering system, which allows surplus power generated by solar to be exported back to the grid and any deficiency is imported from the grid. ?The benefits will be reflected every month in the temple?s electricity bills,? said Ghaverchandji Jivrajji Sanghvi, trustee, adding that the trust spent Rs 26 lakh to install the system with the help of donations from devotees. ?We expect to recover this in the next three years.?In the phase II of the project, the trust wants to convert the entire temple area into a green zone by planting fruiting trees along the periphery and within the temple complex.Satish Gavai, additional chief secretary, state environment department, said, ?We congratulate the different religious groups that have come forward and adopted renewable energy means to produce electricity. Religion can be one of the strongest sources of motivation for people to adopt green practices. These initiatives will encourage devotees to adopt such practices and contribute towards protecting the environment.?",general,3305,58,70

Delhi zoo may launch animal adoption scheme,"The National Zoological Park in New Delhi is exploring options to launch an animal adoption scheme for its inmates. The suggestion had come from the Union environment and forest minister, Harsh Vardhan, a few weeks ago. Several zoos across India have already launched the scheme where a citizen or a corporate firm can adopt an animal.?We are exploring various options to start an animal adoption scheme at the Delhi Zoo. We would launch the scheme once we finalise the modalities,? Renu Singh, director of the National Zoological Park told HT.It is a scheme where a citizen can choose an animal and ?adopt? it after paying a sum fixed by the zoo authorities. The money is usually spent by the zoo to buy food, medicines and to meet other expenses of the animal. In return, the person?s name is displayed on the cage, gets an adoption certificate and free entry to the zoo for a year, among other facilities. Also, the adopter can celebrate birthdays of the animals in the zoo and in some cases he also gets exemption from Income-Tax under section 80 (G) of the Income-Tax Act. Although the scheme is for all animals in the zoo, sources said that usually the scheme is for large animals like tigers, lions and elephants, which require maximum expenditure. In Kolkata, one has to shell out ?2 lakh to adopt a tiger for a year. Birds cost the minimum. ?But there is a difference between the Delhi zoo and other zoos in the country. While the Delhi Zoo is the only zoo in the country which is directly run by the Union ministry, others are managed by the respective state governments. Most of the other zoos which have launched adoption schemes are registered societies and can accept money in the adoption scheme. We can?t,? said Singh.Zoo authorities are now studying the adoption schemes launched by various Indian and foreign zoos to find a way in which it could launch a scheme.?It won?t be like other zoos as we can?t accept money directly. For that we have to register the zoo as a society which would be a long and cumbersome process. So we are planning it differently and that is why we are exploring options,? she added. Several zoos in India such as the Lucknow Zoo, Patna Zoo, Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, Mysore Zoo and Nandankanan in Odisha have already launched such initiatives. ?Even though the contribution we receive is just a token amount of what we spend against each animal, the main objective is the bond that citizens develop with the animals and the people?s participation,? said a senior official of the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata. The Delhi Zoo is also in the process to start celebrating a birthday bash for its inmates. The first birthday party of a white Tiger named Vijay would be celebrated on July 21.",general,2722,43,70

Demands for disability certificates rise as admission nears,"With school and college admissions being the flavour of season, doctors of city's top government hospitals are battling a rush of people with requests for issuance of disability certificates.Demands for disability certificates by parents and students come shortly after the Union government revised the disability act and made it mandatory for government hospitals to issue a differently -abled certificate. Previous disability certificates issued by private doctors are invalid now.A large number of parents are approaching RML doctors. The psychiatry department at the central government hospital is flooded with demands for disability certificates for students.MISUSEIn several case, experts diagnosed students with disability certificates with no disability. ""It is strange to find that even though the child is ineligible to get a disability certificate, top private practitioners' at leading hospitals have issued the same to him. It is a complete misuse,"" said a senior psychiatrist at RML requesting anonymity.Dr Smita Desphande, who heads the department of Psychiatry at RML Hospital told Mail Today, ""Our department has been getting at least 10 cases each day, wherein parents ask for disability certificate for their child to get admission done under the disability quota. Parents thus want their children to be categorised under any sort of disability- be it autism, intellectual disability or speech disorder.""Parents mostly come with their kids complaining Specific Learning Disability (SLD). If doctors approve, the child gets an extra hour for writing and preparing for CBSE, entrance and university exams. Mostly, requests come for students of private schools and colleges.ANYTHING FOR MARKS""Parents know disability certificates would fetch their kids marks, even if the spelling is wrong, and would allot them extra time during exams. Often they come to us saying, 'My child does not want to take up Science, so make the certificate according to requirements,"" said a doctor.""We have a specific tool to calculate the percentage of disability in a child. And when the assessment tool fails to identify any disability, parents force us to still issue a certificate. We were surprised to see that two leading private hospitals in Delhi have made forged disability certificates - which is unethical,"" said a senior psychiatrist at RML. Teachers, according to experts and doctors, are unaware of disability norms.RML doctors said parents are misguided by school teachers often.""There is very poor awareness in teachers. We get the reference from school teachers who ask us to get the certificate done for so and so and our department has been receiving an increasing number of referral case. There is a need for special educators in schools.""If a child is found to be not falling under the disabled category completely and is rather differently abled, with 5-10 per cent of disabilty, we provide that particular certificate and also often try to help them improve by intervention or speech therapy. We try to provide them whatever, treatment is required,"" said Dr Desphande.Last month, Mail Today had reported that that the Centre is bringing in 14 new categories of physical and mental conditions, under the ambit of the Disability Act, 2006. At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acidattack survivors.Ministry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995, mentions only seven categories including people having 40 per cent and above disability, providing them all benefits.In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person. ""The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,"" an official said.

No longer part of BJP: NDA Vice Prez nominee Venkaiah Naidu,"Reaching out to parties across the political divide, National Democratic Alliance (NDA) vice presidential candidate M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said he no longer belonged to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and will strengthen democratic institutions if elected.Naidu, who was flanked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party veteran LK Advani when he filed his nomination in the parliament complex, said the candidature was an ?honour? for him and he will uphold the dignity of the office if elected.In a ?farewell? press conference soon after he filed his nomination, he expressed his gratitude to the prime minister and BJP chief Amit Shah as he played down reports that he was not very keen for the new responsibility.?The office of the vice president has been held by the illustrious people like Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Zakir Hussain, M Hidayatullah, R Venkataraman, Shanker Dayal Sharma and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat... I am fully aware of the august responsibilities associated with the office. I would like to assure the people of the country that, on being elected, I will uphold the traditions and standards set by the worthy predecessors. I will uphold the dignity of the office of the vice president,? he told reporters.India?s beauty and strength lie in its parliamentary democratic system, Naidu said, adding that it will be his endeavour to strengthen this further.The former Union minister recalled his humble beginnings and likened the BJP to his mother.Having lost my mother at a very young age, I grew up with party workers and reached where I have due to the party?s support, Naidu said.?I am above any party now,? he added.Sources close to him said Naidu resigned from the cabinet on Monday night after his candidature was announced.He said he will continue as a member of the Rajya Sabha and cast his vote in the vice presidential poll next month.Naidu?s win is all but certain due to the NDA?s numerical superiority over opposition parties, which have fielded Gopalkrishna Gandhi as their nominee.Members of allies like TDP, Shiv Sena and LJP besides those of AIADMK and TRS, two parties outside the NDA fold but supporting Naidu?s candidature, were among the leaders who accompanied Naidu as he filed his nomination.Top leaders, including Modi, union ministers and allies like Ram Vilas Paswan, were among the proposers and seconders of his nomination.",general,2377,59,70
BJP candidate touted as slum dweller is actually crorepati,"AAP found ammunition to gun for the BJP on Monday after it emerged that the saffron party's Inderpuri candidate for this month's municipal polls, who was touted as a slum dweller and the face of the city's urban poor, happens to be a millionaire. Meet Sunita Kaushik, who was handpicked by the party's city chief Manoj Tiwari. The BJP went on the defensive after she told the state election commission in an affidavit that she has assets worth Rs 1.35 crore, including three residential houses in west Delhi. However, Kaushik is not an income-tax payer. Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Dilip Pandey termed the BJP's support for the slum dwellers and residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi ""hypocrisy"" and ""fake"". By portraying a millionaire candidate as a slum dweller, the BJP has hurt the sentiments of the poor,"" he said. ""It is an insult to lakhs of people living in Delhi's slums and unauthorised colonies in a pitiable condition."" KAUSHIK'S PLUNGE INTO DELHI POLITICSKaushik's plunge into Delhi politics was no less than a scene out of a Bollywood movie. Tiwari, who was on a visit to the Inderpuri slums this New Year's Eve, met the woman who came to the BJP president alleging that ""politicians never listened to the problems of the poor"". straight talk, Tiwari assured her of a ""solution"" and it surprised many when he declared Kaushik as the BJP's candidate from the local municipal ward. It was Tiwari's first visit to Delhi's slums after taking charge of Delhi BJP last year. He had spent the night of December 31, 2016 with the residents of Todapur slums where he also met Sunita Kaushik. ""During the BJP president's visit, she had said that politicians don't listen to the poor. To this, she was promised a solution. Today she is a BJP candidate,"" the party's city unit had said in a statement after announcing her candidature. A senior leader said the BJP had also ensured her ticketkeeping in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to strengthen the weaker sections. ""My visits were a reality check on the condition of slums and unauthorised colonies under the AAP government. I was pained to hear that politicians do not listen to the poor,"" Tiwari said about the interaction at the shanties. PROPERTIES OF SUNITA KAUSHIKKaushik is a millionaire with two houses and jewellery worth Rs 97 lakh. She disclosed that she owns two residential properties measuring 720 square feet and 553 square feet at Dasghara in Inderpuri whose market price is pegged at Rs 50 lakh and Rs 32 lakh, respectively. Her husband, Shashi Bhushan, also owns a house worth Rs 10 lakh. The couple possesses jewellery worth Rs 7 lakh. Kaushik's share in it is valued at Rs 6 lakh. The affidavit also disclosed that she has Rs 50,000 in cash while her husband carries Rs 85,000. However, she only has Rs 1,000 in her bank account, a little more than her spouse's Rs 576. BJP leaders refused to comment on the assets declared by its candidate but said its pick was aimed at supporting the less-privileged. ""While no other party has ever stood with the slum dwellers, the BJP is the only party to have chosen its candidate from the weaker sections. It has been done with a strong intent to strengthen the poor,"" said a party leader.Also Read:Ahead of MCD Polls, AAP slapped with another grievance by RWAs",general,3299,58,70

"Gave birth to boy, hospital handed us girl: Delhi couple","Is it a boy or a girl? Sonia Prajapati, 25, says she gave birth to a son on June 2 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. But the central government-run institute handed her a baby girl. She and her husband are now waiting for the report of a DNA test to end the mystery and their anguish.The hospital says the results would be in its favour and denies any possible baby switch. Sonia and her husband, Bhupender, are distraught. She is still in the gynaecology ward and keeps on looking at the empty crib next to her with tears in her eyes. She feels a little better on seeing other mothers playing with their babies.The couple lives in south Delhi's Khanpur and has lodged a complaint with the Safdarjung Police station.""Mine was a normal delivery. I am certain that I had a given birth to a baby boy and even the doctors showed me. In case this was a girl child and I was wrong, the doctors in the OT and the nursing staff should have corrected me. But they didn't. That proves that I gave birth to baby boy,"" Sonia, who teaches at the NGO Navasrishti, told Mail Today.""Also, without taking my permission, doctors here inserted Copper-T (a device used to prevent pregnancy) into my body. It is illegal. And if our DNA matches with the baby girl, I will accept her,"" Sonia added. DOC REFUTES CLAIMHowever, Dr AK Rai, director of Safdarjung Hospital, told MAIL TODAY that the couple's allegation is wrong.""We are all waiting for the DNA reports and I am sure they will be in our favour as there was no exchange of babies. The DNA reports are likely to come in 20 days and till that time the baby girl is being kept in our nursery and looked after by the nursing staff,"" he said.Dr Rai added that on June 2, only two boys were born at the hospital and the rest were girls. ""At 11am, a patient delivered a baby boy, who was premature and was sent to the nursery and the other male child was born at around 4pm, after the allegations made by Sonia (the patient) over exchange of babies,"" he said. ""How can it be possible?""The young couple waited four years for a child and is not ready to accept the ""wrong"" baby.""They have returned the child to the hospital's nursery but have not got back their own son. We are trying to help them,"" said Krishna Bansal from Navasrishti, who helped the couple raise their voice against the alleged medical negligence. ""Sonia's family approached us. We asked them to take action as previously incidents of medical faults have been noticed at Safarjung Hospital.""Bansal has now written to the National Human Rights Commission to look into the matter.""In this whole scenario, it's the baby girl who is suffering and being kept away from her mother since birth, which is the golden period for any newborn,"" said Bansal.",health,2740,56,70
'Fearless Girl' statue stares down Wall Street Charging Bull,"A new statue of a resolute young girl staring down Wall Street's famous Charging Bull was erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women's Day to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest US corporations.State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors.Artist Kristen Visbal's ""Fearless Girl"" drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot.The girl is sculpted in bronze, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high.""Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,"" reads a plaque at her feet.""As a steward of nearly $2.5 trillion of assets, we want to engage with boards and management around issues that we think will drive core results,"" said Lori Heinel, State Street's deputy global chief investment officer. ""And what you find repeatedly is having more diverse boards and more diverse senior management will actually drive better results for companies.""According to ISS Analytics, a business research firm, just 16 per cent of board seats on companies in the Russell 3000 are held by women; the average board of directors has eight men and one woman.""It's going to happen to the end of time unless you change something,"" says Erik Gordon, a lawyer and professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""It's got to not just be the rules. It's got to be the culture.""State Street has three women on an 11-member board. Heinel said her company also will urge those in Great Britain and Australia to add women to their leadership.One man working in corporate America needed no convincing.Chandrasekar Sundaram says a woman is the CEO of the company he works for in Texas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and has quite a few women reporting to her.""But when it gets to 50 per cent, that's when I think it'll be right,"" said Sundaram, a Dallas resident and native of India who was visiting New York with his family - with the Charging Bull as one of their stops.The mammoth bronze was a ""guerrilla art"" act, dropped in the middle of the night in Bowling Green Park in 1989 without permission, by an artist who created it as a symbol of Americans' survival energy following the 1987 stock market crash. The city gave its permission for the bull to remain.This week, McCann New York, a top advertising agency, installed the statue of the girl before dawn Tuesday - with a city permit for one week.

US woman sets building on fire while trying to kill bug,"A woman trying to burn a bug inside her apartment?s bedroom in the US started a fire which resulted in the evacuation of people from the building and an estimated $140,000 damage to the property.The incident took place at an apartment complex in Topeka, Kansas, with Topeka Fire Marshal Mike Martin saying that an investigation determined the blaze occurred in the master bedroom of an apartment.The cause was listed as being accidental, resulting from an ?occupant trying to kill a bug with a lighter?, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported.Ausha Scott said she was inside the apartment unit at the time of the fire with her mother, Monique Quarles, and 2- year-old child, Avionna Scott-Quarles.Quarles said the blaze started on Monday after she tried to burn a bug that was found in the unit?s master bedroom with a flip-style lighter that malfunctioned.Quarles said she had picked up the first bug, put it in her hand ?and lit it on fire?.She said she and her daughter then looked under the mattress to see if there were any other bugs. They then found what Quarles said was a ?medium-sized bug?.?When I grabbed the bug and I had it, I went to light it and then the lighter started sparking, so these sparks then went onto the box springs,? Quarles said. ?The sparks just started flying on it and inside of it.?The flames and heavy smoke led to the evacuation of the three-floor building.By the time the smoke had cleared, Topeka Fire Department officials estimated $140,000 in damage had occurred.No serious injuries were reported in the blaze.Multiple fire companies responded to the two-alarm blaze and remained on the scene for about six hours, clearing the scene.Quarles said her daughter saw the fire, then ran into the kitchen to get water to put it out.?As she?s coming, I?m going.

First LGBT volunteer unit created to fight ISIS in Syria,"International volunteers battling the Islamic State in Syria have formed a new unit of LGBT people to take on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?s terror group, which has targeted the community for execution by stoning and being thrown off rooftops.The formation of The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army (TQILA), pronounced as tequila, was announced on Twitter by the International Revolutionary People?s Guerrilla Forces (IRPGF) on Monday, complete with a photo of a rainbow flag flying in Raqqa, at the centre of the IS? so-called caliphate.TQILA?s flag features a black AK-47 against a pink background.?These Faggots Kill Fascists!

Since it established its so-called caliphate, it has issued a stream of videos and images depicting the execution of men accused of homosexuality by stoning and being thrown off the roofs of multi-storey buildings.The IS also claimed the deadly shooting by Omar Mateen at the gay Pulse nightclub in Florida in June last year that left 49 people dead after he pledged allegiance to Baghdadi. The courts of the IS have also declared that homosexuality is punishable by death and dozens of LGBT people have fled Iraq and Syria to escape persecution by the group.

The IRPGF did not give any details about the strength of the unit or where its members were operating. TQILA spokesperson Heval Rojhilat told Newsweek that ?many of our comrades are within the LGBT*QI+ community? and were already in action in Raqqa.The IRPGF?s statement also criticised ?Christian conservatives in the global northwest? for targeting LGBT people, saying it is ?not only Daesh whose hatred for Queer, Trans and other non-binary peoples leads to religiously motivated hatred and attacks?. ?We want to emphasise that queerphobia, homophobia and trans-phobia are not inherent to Islam or any other religion. In fact, we know many Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists etc. who are accepting and welcoming of uniqueness and non-conforming people and some who are even queer themselves,? the statement said.",world,3344,56,70

It will only burden criminal courts, which are currently overburdened,? they added.?Continuing the case will only amount to abuse of the court?s processes and it is thus necessary to quash the FIR to secure justice,? said the bench.The bench said that if Pawar failed to produce a certificate issued by head of Padmavati Balkashram within four months, proceedings against him will restart.",general,1361,59,70

Delhi Metro to get 'driverless' trains in June,"Come June and you will be able to travel on the swanky new trains of the Delhi metro, which can also run without drivers. Passengers travelling between Noida and Kalkaji are likely to be the first one to experience the travel with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) scheduled to complete the work on this section of phase-III in May.It will then apply for inspection, which usually takes a month, which means the line can be opened for public by June.The new trains will run on two new lines - Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri west) and will cover a distance of 96 km. Delhi metro has also ordered 516 coaches (86 trains). These trains will run only on these two lines and cannot be integrated with the other existing lines. These trains have many unique features, which sets it apart from existing trains.Trials between Botanical Garden in Noida and Kalkaji Mandir (13 kilometres) in Delhi had started on October 27 last year while trial runs between Terminal 1-IGI airport and Janakpuri west (10KM) began on December 21. Track laying is nearing completion in the remaining underground section between Terminal 1 ? IGI Airport and Kalkaji Mandir and trials will be started on this section also in the coming months.?Since the signalling system and trains are new, we need at least six months of trial run. The mandatory tenure is completed for the Botanical Garden-Kalkaji section and after opening the Heritage Line (ITO-Kashmere Gate), we will start the process for this section,? said a DMRC official.The new trains, with extremely high levels of automation, had to undergo rigorous trials between these stations to ensure that they are ready for smooth operations after the commissioning of the corridor. Initially, train operators will run the trains, but gradually, driverless operations (on the Unattended Train Operation or UTO mode) will be possible.During the trial runs, the interface of the metro train was checked to ensure that there was no physical infringement with civil infrastructure and the various subsystems of coaches were also tested.Later on, in stages, the new signalling technology was implemented on this corridor; the Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) had to undergo rigorous testing. The response of the train at different speeds, braking and the interconnection with the Operations Control Centre (OCC) was also monitored during the trials. The behaviour of the track system and the Over Head Electrification (OHE) was checked repeatedly.This particular section from Botanical Garden till Kalkaji Mandir consists of nine elevated stations ? Botanical Garden, Okhla Bird sanctuary, Kalindi Kunj, Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh, Okhla Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Sukhdev Vihar, Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir.

Air India Chairman asks staff to carry their own luggage,"In the last few months, India?s pervasive culture of privilege has got a sound beating: In March, Ravindra Gaikwad, an MP, hit a 60-year-old Air India (AI) employee with a slipper and soon found himself on a ?no-fly? list. Then in April, the Cabinet banned red beacons on cars. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that there are no VIPs, every Indian is a very important person.On Wednesday, Air India (AI) scrapped one more privilege, this time an in-house one. Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani asked the staff to carry their hand baggage on their own and not use porters as has been the practice so far. Air India has a subsidiary called AI-SATS, a ground handling agency, which provides end-to-end services such as passenger and baggage handling. Apart from this, some people are reserved to assist VIPs and airline staff. They are called porters and carry the luggage of the ?VIP? passenger from the entry gate to the boarding point. But now only VIPs will continue to use the services of porters, the airline staff will be discouraged to use it. ?Even CMD will not use the porter service,? the airline said.While the move appreciable, the change is cosmetic. The move would have got a higher rating if this privilege was taken away from VIPs too. While such changes are fine and make for good optics, there are so many things that the AI needs to fix and, hopefully, those will also get adequate attention. Take for example, the airline?s rating and public perception. In January, flight data firm FlightStats marked AI as the third worst-performing airline in the world. The Portland-headquartered firm?s survey highlighted issues over cabins, service quality, and flight delays. Though Air India disagreed with the report, such reports do impact public perception and eventually bookings. It is important to manage perceptions and AI has to invest time, effort and money into it apart from doing away with perks and privileges extended to staff. Then its finances. As a columnist pointed out last week, the organisation has consistently incurred losses and is severely debt-ridden despite equity infusion of around Rs 25,000 crore since 2012. More damaging was the Comptroller and Auditor General?s performance audit report of the airline, which was tabled in Parliament in March. The report said inefficiencies in the company may mean that a lot more of public money will be needed to keep the Maharaja afloat.",general,2451,56,70

Can't diagnose TB due to liquor ban: Health Min to Bihar,"The ban on liquor in Bihar may have had some positives but it has taken a toll on the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the state.Conducting tests for diagnosing tuberculosis has become an uphill task in Bihar since the ban on liquor was imposed in the state last year, said a senior health department official.This has prompted the Union health ministry to write to the state health department seeking special exemption for procuring and using alcohol and spirit for uninterrupted diagnostic services.There is a scarcity of ethyl alcohol which is used to conduct such tests in the laboratories, including those in government facilities, according to Dr Jagdish Prasad, director general of health services under the Union ministry of health.In his letter to the principal secretary, department of health in Bihar, Prasad said prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment is essential for a successful tuberculosis control programme and its diagnosis at peripheral levels continues to be performed primarily by smear microscopy.The reagents required for smear microscopy (both Ziehl Neelsen and Fluorescent staining) include absolute alcohol. Spirit is also needed for lamps used for making smears. Cleaning of plungers of the CBNAAT, as part of monthly maintenance also requires alcohol, he said in the letter.Freshly prepared 70% alcohol is also required at all levels for surface disinfection.?With the alcohol ban imposed in Bihar, the laboratories are facing difficulty in procuring alcohol and this has affected the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the state,? Prasad said in the letter, dated June 29.?In view of the above and in public interest, special exemption for procuring and using alcohol and spirit for uninterrupted diagnostic services under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is required,? he said.The state had last year recorded 64,158 cases of tuberculosis in government hospitals, which is 33% of the total cases there.There are 736 microscopic labs besides 38 special labs for detecting TB.?Bihar government should abolish ban on the use of alcohol and spirit specially in laboratories and hospital setups. Alcohol and spirit are used for preparation of reagents for microscopy. This is essential for microscopy test.?We urge the government of Bihar to sweep away the ban over alcohol in hospital and laboratory,? he told PTI.Bihar was on April 5, 2016 declared a dry state with the Nitish Kumar government imposing a total ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol including India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).On several occasions, the chief minister highlighted that the prohibition has had positive impact in the state, with road accidents going down and people saving more money.",health,2718,57,70

"Unaccompanied child taken off overbooked plane, left at gate","EasyJet has opened an investigation after an unaccompanied child was removed from an overbooked flight from London Gatwick.The 15-year-old was taken from his seat on flight EZY8333 to Toulouse on Thursday morning, and left alone at the departure gate.

His mother helped him check in at the airport with his bags before he went through security to the gate. Read was given a boarding pass for seat 9A but after texting his mother to tell her he was aboard, another passenger claimed his seat. With the plane overbooked, Read was told to leave the plane. He texted his mother, Stephanie Portal, who returned to the airport and found staff to help locate her son in departures. Read?s grandparents had already embarked on the two-hour round trip to Toulouse from their home to meet him.Eventually, Portal persuaded easyJet to allocate her son a seat on the final departure of the day to Toulouse, although she said the airline?s system apparently showed all four flights on Thursday were overbooked.The final flight, scheduled to depart at 6.40pm, was delayed by almost three hours, meaning Read finally arrived in Toulouse well after midnight.Portal said: ?It?s crazy.

Over 10 lakh Muslims sign RSS petition against Triple Talaq,"Even as the BJP and the Opposition are still calculating if there was a shift in Muslim votes towards the saffron party in UP that contributed to its landslide victory, over a million Muslims from across the country - mostly women - have already signed a petition moved by RSS-affiliated Muslim body Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) against the practice of triple talaq.The Muslim body - RSS pracharak Indresh Kumar is the liason from the Sangh's side who ""guides"" the MRM - has also called for a nationwide discussion on the issue that involves all the stakeholders.""This is a problem of the community and the stakeholders within the community as well as the representatives from the state and the government must come and sit together to start a debate on this so that Muslim women can claim a human status,"" the organisation told Mail TodayBJP: TRIPLE TALAQ STAND HELPED PARTY IN UPAs the party itself puts it, one of the major contributing factors, as it claims, in its victory was a definite support from Muslim women who were moved by the party's stance on triple talaq as a repressive practice that needed to be done away with.""Three factors, I suppose, defined our victory in the UP polls: first was Ujjwala scheme that provided LPG cylinders to poor women; second was construction of toilets under the Swachh Bharat programme, which also appealed to women; and last but not the least, our stand on triple talaq,"" said Sidharth Nath Singh, party secretary and newly elected MLA from Allahabad West.While the signature campaign of MRM is still on, the outfit had warned the traditionally conservative clergy of the community to desist from making a religious issue out of a practice that was a social problem.""The fact that the BJP was able to get Muslim votes in UP, the fact that they also won the Muslim-majority Deoband seat - that is long supposed to be the stronghold of orthodox Ulema - suggest that the party and the central government need to heed the voice of the Muslim women. Their support in polls is a tacit approval of the BJP's stand on the issue,"" said MRM national coordinator Mohammad Afzal.""The fact that the BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate for the UP polls did not deter women of the community to at least in part vote for the party,"" claimed another functionary of the MRM on conditions of anonymity.Afzal also said the traditional clergy of the community needed to wake up. ""The fact that a terrorist was killed and his father denounced him in the light of the latter's love for the nation and then a girl is issued a fatwa against for singingâ?¦all these things point to the changing scenario in India. They should wake up now and stop trying to convert the social evil of triple talaq from a social problem into a religious problem.""Even the great grandson of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a tall Muslim Congress leader of Indian history, extolled Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""positive attitude towards the Muslims"".

"Delhi Metro to launch housing scheme with 2BHK, 3BHK flats","The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to launch its housing scheme in May this year. DMRC is building 2BHK and 3BHK flats in the city?s Janakpuri and Okhla areas in Delhi that will cost between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 1.20 crore. Brochures will be released next month with an application form to book a flat, which DMRC promises to deliver by 2019. ?We have identified two plots near Okhla and Janakpuri (west) metro stations. We will construct 460 flats in Janakpuri and 90 in Okhla. The flats will be allotted on the basis of a draw and people can apply as soon as we open the scheme.

This is the first time that DMRC is constructing flats for public. Until now, it had constructed residential apartments only for its staff in Shastri Park, Yamuna Bank and Pushp Vihar. DMRC hopes to earn at least Rs 500 crore from the new housing scheme.?The price of the flats will not be altered. The applicant will need to pay a booking amount and if his/her name does not appear in the final list, the money will be refunded. We will publicise the scheme once the brochure is ready,? he added.DMRC has also decided to come up with a commercial complex in the heart of the city near Jantar Mantar where they will rent out space for offices. DMRC official said that notification of Ministry of Urban Development on changes in Transit Oriented Development Policy (TOD) policy has also paved way for vertical growth along the Delhi Metro corridor, which will eventually help them to use more space for commercial purpose.Under the TOD policy, a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 400 has been approved. This will enable high rises to come up in these areas and make for denser colonies. TOD colonies can come up in the ?influence zone? of the Metro which extends to 500 meters on both sides of the corridor.",general,1963,58,70

"After fuel, govt planning daily CNG price revision: Reports","The government is planning to roll out daily price revision of CNG similar to what the oil companies have been doing to decide on the prices of petrol, diesel. Currently, price of CNG is revised monthly.India Oil Corporation (IOC) CMD Sanjay Singh confirmed the news to India Today that petroleum companies are in the process of revising CNG price on a daily basis. Petroleum companies had last month decided that petrol and diesel prices would be revised on a daily basis in select towns in sync with international rates similar to what happens in most advanced markets. State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), which own more than 95 per cent of the nearly 58,000 petrol pumps in the country, launched a pilot for daily price revision in five select cities last and plan to gradually extend it to other parts of the country.While petrol price was freed from the control of the government in June 2010, diesel rates were deregulated in October 2014.Technically, oil companies have freedom to revise rates but often they have been guided by political considerations. Rates differ by only a few paise between pumps of the three state fuel retailers. With daily changes, which are unlikely to be more than a few paise per litre, the political pressures for not revising rates particularly when they are to be hiked will go, people in know of the matter said.ALSO READ:",general,1458,59,70

The UP Chief Minister also said that if needed, the state government would make available additional funds under this head, but there should not be any problem of drinking water for the people and the cattle in Bundelkhand region. ""Adityanath is also expected to visit the region this month,"" a UP government spokesperson said. The UP Chief Minister said that Budelkhand was constinuously ignored in the last 15 years and no steps had been taken to ensure the wholistic development of the region. Adityanath said he was aware of the hardships faced by the people of the region. ""Now, the state government will make all efforts to ensure the development of the region in a planned manner,"" the spokesperson said quoting the Chief Minister. During his Deoria to Dilli Kisan Yatra in September, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had accused the Uttar Pradesh government of failing to improve situation in the Bundelkhand region, which was battling continuous drought. ""The requirement in Bundelkhand is different and it needs to be addressed differently,"" he had said at a khat sabha in Banda. Rahul had alleged that the Congress-led UPA government had given a special package to the area, but the SP government in Uttar Pradesh did not lend support to improve the situation in the region.

Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme passes away at 73,"Film director Jonathan Demme, best known for The Silence of the Lambs and Something Wild, has died at the age of 73. His publicist told Variety that the cause of death was ?cancer complications?.The Silence of the Lambs, the horror-thriller adapted from Thomas Harris? novel, was the high point of his career as a mainstream film-maker: the film won five Oscars, including best director for Demme, and made its central character, Hannibal Lecter, into a household name.However, it was untypical of Demme?s career, both before and after its 1991 release. Having spent much of the 1960s living in London and working as a music writer, Demme cut his teeth in the no-budget school of Roger Corman: initially as a writer, then gaining his first directorial credit on the prison flick Caged Heat in 1974. (Its tag line: ?Women?s prison USA ? Rape Riot and Revenge! White Hot Desires melting cold prison steel!)After directing two other films for Corman, Demme found a niche in the burgeoning independent cinema scene with his 1980 film Melvin and Howard, a comedy about a former milkman who claims to be the heir of Howard Hughes. Later in the same decade, Demme completed the yuppie-in-peril comedy Something Wild, which gave Melanie Griffith one of her early successful roles.The Silence of the Lambs, he said later, ?was a great delirious shock to everybody concerned?, but he appeared to being disquieted by the controversies that accompanied it, and subsequently concentrated on films that reflected his own politically liberal credentials. Philadelphia, which starred Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance and brought Aids and gay characters into the mainstream. Meanwhile, Beloved, released in 1998, was an adaptation of Toni Morrison?s seminal novel about slavery.Alongside his feature film career, Demme indulged a taste for the odd, the eccentric and the underground. He made documentaries about Talking Heads (including Stop Making Sense, 1984), Neil Young (among them Heart of Gold, 2006) and his radical priest cousin (Cousin Bobby, 1992); he filmed Spalding Gray?s celebrated one-man show Swimming to Cambodia (1987), and shot a profile of US president Jimmy Carter (Man from Plains, 2007).His mainstream film-making took a dip in the 2000s, after the poorly received remake of Charade, The Truth About Charlie and a new version of The Manchurian Candidate, but he restored his reputation with the wedding comedy-drama Rachel Getting Married and the likable girl-rocker film Ricki and the Flash.Jodie Foster, who won an Oscar for her role in The Silence of the Lambs, released a statement earlier today. ?I am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you?d have to design a hurricane to contain him,? it read. ?Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much.? Meryl Streep, who took the title role in Ricki and the Flash, also released a statement to pay tribute to ?A big hearted, big tent, compassionate man?, while Tom Hanks called him ?the grandest of men?.Very sad to hear of the passing of the great Jonathan Demme. Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films. He could do anything.Film-makers such as Edgar Wright and James Wan have also paid tribute to Demme on Twitter, with Wright saying: ?Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films.

Petya hackers clean out ?7 lakh Bitcoin from ransom wallet,"The hackers behind the NotPetya ransomware, which wiped computers in more than 60 countries in late June, have moved more than £8,000 worth of bitcoins out of the account used to receive the ransoms.The transfer has added credence to messages purporting to be from the attackers offering to decrypt every single infected computer for a one-off payment of £200,000, after security researchers suggested they may be state-sponsored actors. It is possible to see the movement of the ransom payments thanks to the public nature of the bitcoin currency: all transfers are recorded on the public blockchain, although the real-world identities of the individuals or organisations behind a particular payment address can be near-impossible to discern.Currently, the blockchain records that the bulk of the ransom money, £7,872 worth of bitcoin, was simply transferred to a second wallet on Tuesday night, but two smaller payments, of £200 each, went to accounts used by two text-sharing websites, Pastebin and DeepPaste.Around 10 minutes before the payments were made, someone made posts on both those sites claiming to be able to decrypt hard disks infected with the malware in exchange for a payment of 100 bitcoins.The £200,000 offer has created more uncertainty about the motivations behind the ransomware. While it originally appeared to be created with the intention of earning a lot of money through ransom payments, researchers quickly pointed out that a number of features of the software made it appear that the ransom element was a smokescreen, with the real goal being widespread damage.Significantly, the majority of infections occurred in Ukraine, due to the main attack vector being a compromised version of an accounting program, ME Doc, used to file taxes in the nation. That has led to many, including the Ukrainian government, suspecting Russian involvement as part of the ongoing cyberwar between the two countries.Hackers offering to decrypt files for money suggests that the cash motivation may be more significant than thought ? but that too could be misdirection.While the hackers continue to play games, the Ukrainian cybercrime unit is continuing its investigation. On Wednesday, it announced that it had seized ME Doc?s servers after ?new activity? was detected there, and said it had acted to ?immediately stop the uncontrolled proliferation? of malware.Cyber police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko suggested that ME Doc had sent or was preparing to send a new update and added that swift action had prevented any further damage. ?Our experts stopped (it) on time,? she said.It wasn?t immediately clear how or why hackers might still have access to ME Doc?s servers. The company has not returned messages from reporters, but in several statements took to Facebook to dispute allegations that its poor security helped seed the malware epidemic.Cyber police chief Coonel Serhiy Demydiuk previously said that ME Doc?s owners would be brought to justice, but Kvitko said there had been no arrests.",technology,3006,58,70

TRAI's MySpeed portal had previously in October revealed that Reliance Jio was the slowest 4G service provider in India.TRAI's MySpeed online portal, unlike its Android and iOS app, doesn't test the speed of an individual connection. It, instead, shows you the data of tests conducted across the country.In order to check Jio's speed performance you will need to select 'Jio' as an operator, 4G as technology, and then compare the network with other (all) operators. The resulting graph, currently, shows Jio as having the highest average 4G download speed at 9.9Mbps with Airtel at second with 5.8Mbps. Vodafone, meanwhile, stands fifth with 4.2Mbps download speed. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited subsidiary recently announced the Jio Happy New Year Offer for all existing and new users that ""extends free voice, data, video call, SMS and Jio apps till March 31, 2017."" The Happy New Year Offer basically is an extension to Jio's Welcome Offer that ended on December 3, 2016.""Customers who buy Jio SIM cards December 4, 2016 onwards will be part of the Happy New Year Offer, while existing users who signed up for Jio Welcome Offer will automatically be moved to the new offer effective from 1st January 2017,"" the company said.The earlier data limit of 4GB was brought down to 1GB after Jio announced the Happy New Year Offer.",technology,1547,55,70
Einstein's 'tongue-out' photograph to be auctioned,"Wild haired with a bushy moustache and his tongue sticking out, the photograph revealing Albert Einstein as something of a prankster is one of the most recognisable images of the physicist. Now a signed and dated copy is about to be auctioned.Snapped by United Press International photographer Arthur Sasse as Einstein departed in the back of car following his 72nd birthday celebrations in 1951, the image shot into the public consciousness after publishers overcame their initial qualms and printed the jovial image.Even the Nobel laureate himself was amused at the photo, requesting cropped copies which he then signed and gave to friends. But the current auctioneers note that the image that is set to go under the hammer on 27 July is unusual in also showing the companions who left the Princeton club with Einstein that night: Frank Aydelotte, director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein worked, and Aydelotte?s wife, Marie Jeanette.If previous sales are a guide, the latest lot could scoop a sizeable sum: copies signed by the physicist have recently sold for almost $44,000, with a signed, cropped version of the photo bearing a handwritten German rhyme selling for $125,000.Einstein?s leather jacket sold for £110,000 last year, but a photograph may be a safer bet for Einstein aficionados: the jacket was dubbed ?rather pungent? by the auctioneers.",science,1387,50,70

Delhi civic bodies to jail people for littering,"Trash the city and you may end up behind bars.To deter litterbugs, Delhi's BJP-ruled civic bodies are planning to make discarding of waste in public places and even allowing mosquito breeding in households a criminal offence with appropriate jail terms under the Indian Penal Code.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation has already issued orders in this regard and the two other agencies will follow suit, officials said. Municipal magistrates will keep a check on violators and ensure they are prosecuted. A person can get a maximum jail term of six months for such an offence.The Narendra Modi government last year directed states to start levying fines for littering, open defecation and public urination as the Prime Minister's flagship Swachh Bharat Mission failed to have the desired effect in urban areas. 'EXISTING PENALTY TOO WEAK'According to MCD officials, the existing penalty on violating sanitation bylaws is too weak to deter people and so it was decided to slap criminal charges on them. The imprisonment would vary from one month to six months depending on severity of the violation.""To keep Delhi free of littering and insanitary conditions, various provisions of IPC and the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act may be invoked against the violators...departments may proceed accordingly,"" said an order issued by the chief law officer of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation.Public spaces in the Capital often are eyesores full of rotting piles of garbage along the streets, in neighbourhoods, public parks and playgrounds, and outside fancy air-conditioned malls and five-star hotels. HIGH COURT INSTRUCTIONSThe move from the corporations follows instructions of the Delhi High Court to maintain proper sanitation in the city. The court had recently pulled up the three civic bodies and had said that even citizens should take the responsibility of keeping their surroundings clean. The HC directed that a time-bound garbage collection system be set up to prevent the piling of waste. A senior MCD official said mosquito breeding in households is a key concern of the civic body as this could result into the outbreak of vectorborne diseases like dengue and chikungunya. ""Cases of dengue in recent years have been on the rise, claiming several lives. The occupants of a house where dengue larva is found may be booked for endangering public life and causing health hazards. The provision attracts a fine and imprisonment of up to six months,"" he said. Similarly, negligence by people that is likely to spread fatal diseases would also be dealt with strictly. The civic body has identified 14 provisions under IPC to deal with sanitation woes. Any pollution that may cause fouling of drinking water has also been put in the category of criminal offences. 'FAILED ATTEMPTS' Officials said repeated attempts by the MCDs to amend the sanitation bylaws for higher penalty have failed to yield results. The draft of the amendment is pending with the Delhi government for the last seven years. The modified rules would have provision for hefty penalties up to Rs 10,000 and five times higher for repeated offenders. Apart from the fine, the civic bodies have also proposed widening the ambit of the law. Littering caused by distributing food material (langar), illegal burning of solid waste, improper storage of construction material and non-segregation of recyclable and nonrecyclable waste will attract fines. These activities were till now undefined and so exempted from prosecution. The MCDs proposed to increase the fine for littering caused by langars to Rs 5,000, while penalty for dumping construction material on roadside was fixed at Rs 10,000. The proposed amendment prescribed a fine of Rs 500 for littering, spitting and urinating in public places. It also empowers the municipal magistrates to order community services, like road cleaning, garbage and graffiti removal, in case a person fails to pay the fine. The amendment in ""Delhi Sanitation and Public Health Bylaws"" was proposed by the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on June 23, 2010 and the civic body had adopted it through a resolution passed by the House.",general,4157,47,70

Delhi power companies ordered to buy more green energy,"Power distribution companies will now have to procure more green energy or electricity generated from renewable sources.The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has issued a new regulation according to which discoms will either have to generate their own electricity through renewable sources or increase their purchase of green energy from generating companies.The draft rules termed as the ?DERC (Renewable Purchase Obligation and Renewable Energy Certificate Framework Implementation) Regulations, 2017 will also make it compulsory for discoms to buy 100% electricity being generated from the waste-to-energy (WTE) plants set up in the Capital. Currently, Delhi has four WTE plants. ?The distribution licensees shall compulsorily procure 100% power produced from all the Waste-to-Energy plants in the State, in the ratio of their procurement of power from all sources including their own as approved by the Commission from time to time, which shall qualify towards compliance of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for the Distribution Licensee,? read the draft regulations for which comments from public are being sought.

The DERC in October 2012 had notified regulations making RPO compulsory for all discoms in the city. RPOs make it mandatory for all discoms to purchase some percentage of electricity through renewable sources of energy.

Rape incidents in Delhi have tripled since Dec 16 gang rape,"On the night of December 16, 2012, when a young woman was brutally gang raped by six men in a bus in and left to die, the moment was described as one that would change Delhi?s attitude towards women?s safety. But, four years later, the situation has only worsened. Data shows that rape continues to top the city?s heinous crime figures, with at least one case registered every four hours.Incidents of rape in Delhi have steadily increased since the incident, rising from 706 in 2012 to 2199 in 2016. Police attribute this to more women coming forward to lodge complaints after the 2012 incident. But, at the same time, the conviction rate for rape has dropped dramatically. In 2012, the police had secured a 49.25% conviction in rape cases, which fell to 35.69% in 2013 and 34.5% in 2014. Last year, the conviction rate was a mere 29.37%. Not only in percentage terms, there has been a drop even in absolute numbers over the last two years ? from 747 out of 2166 cases in 2014 to 645 out of 2199 in 2015.All this, in spite of a series of reforms put in place since 2012, and six fast-track courts set up to handle rape cases. Massive protests at India Gate and across the country in 2012 sparked off gender sensitisation classes for 40,792 Delhi cops till date and launched Operation Nirbheek, in which police visited girls from more than 5000 schools to speak to them about safety. Over 1.83 lakh girls were also trained in self defence. But stories of sexual assault and rape continue to haunt Delhi. This December 13, a 15-year-old girl was gang raped by four men in south east Delhi?s Jamia Nagar. The four men had also videotaped the act and blackmailed the teenager. In September, a 3-year-old was brutally raped by her uncle and burnt with cigarettes at their house in Govindpuri.Read |?Four years on, ?juvenile? of Dec 16 gang rape now cooking at a roadside eaterySenior police officers say most rapes cannot be prevented because they happen in confined environments by those known to the victims.

Compensation for disabled paramilitary jawans upped to ?20L,"New Delhi, Jun 18 (PTI) Ex-gratia compensation for paramilitary personnel, injured in action leading to 100 per cent disability, has been increased from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 20 lakh.

HDFC Bank sees lowest-ever profit growth at 15% on note ban,"Mumbai, Jan 24 (PTI) Private sector HDFC Bank today reported its lowest-ever quarterly profit growth at 15 per cent at Rs 3,865.3 crore for the December quarter, pulled down by a margin compression following the note-ban and foreign currency deposit redemptions. The city-headquartered lender, which had made a name for itself by consistently delivering 30 per cent profit growth for more than 32 quarters without a break till about two years ago, and then slipped to the 20 per cent levels with sluggish economic growth, saw its margins narrowing by 10 bps to 4.10 per cent during the third quarter ended December 31. The Aditya Puri-headed bank also saw redemptions of USD 3 billion worth of NRI deposits raised under a special window opened by the RBI in 2013 which led to a USD 2-billion reduction in the foreign currency loan book. HDFC Bank had raised the largest amount through this window. The lender saw a 37 per cent surge in the current and saving account balances which helped the share of the low-cost deposits ratio to 45 per cent after the November 8 demonetisation. It can be noted banks were not able to benefit from the surge fully because of 100 per cent CRR on new deposits till December 8. Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankar acknowledged this is the slowest profit growth ever for over two decade-old bank but defended it, saying this is because of the external environment, and declined to give any guidance on how it sees the next few quarters. He, however, said the private lender will continue to outgrow the system, and gave out data on both deposits and advances growth where it has achieved this. He said the bank lost out on ""fairly meaningful"" quantum of fees from point of sale terminals and ATM usage during the demonetisation exercise (Nov 9-Dec 30), but said this is for the benefit of larger good in the long-term. Sukthankar made a plea for a ""balance"" to be achieved on the merchant discount rates so that those investing in the infrastructure also benefit. But the market lapped the bank counter as they believe the lender did well in a challenging time.",general,2101,59,70
Arvind Panagariya quits as Niti Aayog Vice Chairman,"Indian-American economist Arvind Panagariya is stepping down as vice chairperson of Niti Aayog, the government?s policy think tank, and returning to academics in New York?s Columbia University.The 64-year-old professor of economics was picked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2015 to head the National Institution for Transforming India, better known as Niti Aayog, which replaced the Planning Commission.?I have requested the Prime Minister to relieve me from my responsibility as my leave in Columbia University is coming to an end on September 5 and I have decided to join back,? he told reporters on Tuesday. ?The PM has agreed after listening to me.?He will serve the think tank till August-end.According to government sources, Modi wanted him to stay but relented when Panagariya told him that his wife too wants to be with their children in the US.Panagariya said he informed the Prime Minister, who is the ex-officio chairman of Niti Aayog, about his decision about two months ago after Columbia University refused to make an exemption for him and extend his two-year, public-service leave.?There is nothing unusual in this. Henry Kissinger returned to Harvard after his leave was not extended,? he added.Modi chose him to head the new think tank to decide policies for accelerating India?s growth after his government dismantled the Soviet-style Planning Commission that functioned for 64 years.Panagariya, who is standing down after two-and-a-half years in the job, said he is satisfied with the stint in which his team built the organisation?s foundation and forged ties with the Centre and states.?Many states adopted our land leasing law bill. Over 400 schools have Atal Tinkering labs and we promoted digital economy in a big way.?He is the second economist after former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan to quit a top job in India and return to academics in the US. Rajan resigned after a three-year term in 2016 to rejoin Chicago University.At US universities one can teach as long as health permits.Panagariya said: ?I would not have got a similar job.

It also recommended minimal government intervention in agriculture and replacing the minimum support price for farmers with a deficiency payment.But the think tank had its fare share of criticism. Some of its reform-oriented proposals were not accepted, or appreciated either.The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmer union affiliated to the ruling BJP?s ideological mentor RSS, called several Niti Aayog proposals anti-farmer and anti-labour.?There is poor response (from the government) to labour and services sectors.

"Mughal Gardens roses named after Pranab Mukherjee, wife","New Delhi, Feb 3 (PTI) The famous Mughal Gardens of Rashtrapati Bhavan will this year have special roses named after President Pranab Mukherjee and his wife Suvra Mukherjee. This is the first time a special rose is named after a President. While the rose named after Mukherjee is yellow, the one in name of his wife is pink-purple. ""For the first time, two new roses named after President Pranab Mukherjee and his wife late Suvra Mukherjee have been put on display. The special roses are developed by plant breeders from Pushpanjali rose nursery, Jakpur, West Bengal. ""The nursery approached the rose federation corporation to release these two new varieties. The India Rose Federation approved the same and released the varieties in January during a rose show in West Bengal,"" Secretary to the President, Venu Rajamony, said. The roses, which are on display in the main Mughal Gardens have not flowered yet but the authorities are hopeful they will bloom before the garden closes on March 12. Besides this, the other big highlights of Udyanotsav 2017 are special theme-based exhibition of vertical garden forms and air purifying plants. With an aim to increase awareness about the benefits of air purifying plants, around 30 varieties of them including Banana, Dedrobium orchid, Weeping fig, Moth orchid, Red edged Dracaena, Barberton daisy, Aloe Vera, English Ivy, Dwarf Date Palm among others, have been put on display in various sections across the gardens. A combination of flowering and other house plants has been used to inscribe words India and Jai Hindi on the walls of the gardens.

"Airtel misleading, discriminating against users, accuses Jio","By Prasoon Srivastava New Delhi, May 1 (PTI) In a new face-off, telecom operator Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel is violating tariff rules by issuing misleading offers and arbitrarily discriminating among its own customers subscribing to the same plan. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has demanded highest penalty imposed on Sunil Bharti Mittals Bharti Airtel by telecom regulator Trai alleging that the two plans of Airtel -- priced at Rs 293 and Rs 449 respectively -- are being marketed in a misleading manner. It said that Airtels advertisements of these offers are an attempt to lure prospective subscribers making them believe that they will be provided 1 GB data per day for 70 days. ""However, the subscribers who do not satisfy Airtels dual criteria, will be provisioned only 50 MB data and post that, they will be charged the exorbitant data tariff of Rs 4,000 per GB,"" Jio said. Under the said plans, Airtel is offering unlimited local and STD calls along with 1 GB of mobile internet per day for 70 days to customers with 4G handsets and 4G SIM. In case of Rs 293 plan, unlimited calling is limited within the Airtel network. Other Airtel customers availing these plans get only 50 MB of data usage per day for 35 days. Jio said that Airtel is offering these recharges ""in a grossly discriminating basis by providing the headline data benefits of 1 GB data per day for 70 days only to the new subscribers holding a 4G handset in conjunction with a 4G compatible SIM card. All other subscribers are provided substantially lower data benefits of 50 MB for 35 days."" Jio said that with reduction in validity of the plan for other set of customers, the value of voice calls also gets reduced. ""Airtel has chosen to create an arbitrary distinction on the basis of subscribers possessing 4G handset and 4G SIM. It has arbitrarily reduced the validity of voice benefits under same recharge for the same class of subscribers without a 4G handset or 4G SIM...,"" Jio said. The new entrant alleged that the ""arbitrary classification"" by Airtel is a gross violation of the telecom tariff order 1999. When contacted, a Bharti Airtel spokersperson denied the allegations and said that the company is in full compliance of all regulatory guidelines, including tariff orders. ""These allegations are nothing but a continuation of Reliance Jios standard ploy of blaming others for all its problems, including network deficiencies,"" the Airtel spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that what is even more ironic is that Jio itself offered free services for several months but is now pointing fingers at other operators, who are merely offering simple discounts to their own customers to retain them.",general,2711,60,70
"Women sacrificing love for parents common in India, says SC","By Abhishek Anshu New Delhi, Jun 18 (PTI) Unsuccessful love stories have found a very vivid description in a Supreme Court observation wherein it has said that women sacrificing their relationship to accept parents decision is a common phenomenon in India. The apex court noted this in a judgement which set aside the conviction and life sentence of a man who had survived a pact with a woman to commit suicide immediately after secretly entering into wedlock. While the 23-year-old woman could not be saved in the incident of 1995, the man suffered the ordeal as the police booked him for the offence of killing her. The top court noted that the woman might have first ""unwillingly"" agreed to go by her parents wish but later she apparently changed her mind which appeared from the scene of the incident where garlands, bangles and vermilion were found. Further, it observed that the woman might have told her lover that due to resistance from her family, she would not marry him. ""Such a reaction on the part of a girl to sacrifice her love and accept a decision of her parents, even though unwillingly, is a common phenomenon in this country,"" a bench of justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said. The court noted that the victim and the accused were in love with each other and the womans father had testified in the court that due to caste differences, his family had refused to give their nod to the couple to marry. The man was convicted for allegedly killing her and awarded life term by a trial court and the verdict was subsequently upheld by the Rajasthan High Court. The man had told the trial court that since her family was not agreeing to their marriage, both of them had decided to commit suicide and consumed copper sulphate at a house in an under-construction building in Jaipur. He had said that the quantity of copper sulphate consumed by him was less as compared to the woman after which her health deteriorated and he went out of the building to seek help from neighbours. When he returned, he found the woman hanging after which she was rushed to a hospital but she eventually died. The mans version of the incident was held as ""plausible"" by the apex court which noted that as per his statement, the woman was physically abused by her family and was mercilessly beaten even on the day of incident in November 1995. ""When she was madly in love with the appellant (man) and wanted to marry him, there is a possibility that after receiving such kind of shabbily treatment at the hands of her parents, in anguish she may have decided to revolt and, therefore, proposed to the appellant that they should get married for which they chose a secluded place,"" the bench noted in its order.",general,2705,59,70

Plea in SC to let Tirupati temple exchange old notes of ?8cr,"A man from Andhra Pradesh requested the Supreme Court last week to direct the government and the federal bank to let Sri Tirumala Tirupati Venkateshwara temple exchange Rs 8.29 crore of banned banknotes donated by devotees.Visited by millions, the shrine dedicated to god Venkateshwara in Tirupati is the world?s second richest with assets worth Rs 50,000 crore and an annual income of around Rs 650 crore.It has several crores of old Rs 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes stashed in collection boxes for donations. These have become defunct after the government recalled the two high-value notes and temple authorities missed last year?s December 30 deadline to get them exchanged.VV Ramanmurthy, a journalist, said in his petition that non-acceptance of the devotees? offering to the temple was not only discriminatory but also meant their wishes will remain unfulfilled.?That the pilgrims and devotees offerings made to Lord Venkateshwara Swami was not accepted/redeemed by Reserve Bank of India, due to which about Rs 8.29 crore consisting of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were packed and kept in boxes with Tirumala Tirupati Devastanam,? read the petition that advocate Shravan Kumar filed on his behalf.The Tirupati board runs a string of temples in cities and towns such as New Delhi, Rishikesh, Guwahati, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kanyakumari.The petitioner said collections at temples in Chennai and Hyderabad are deposited in banks once a week, but it is done once in six months in the other places.Ramanmurthy contended that not accepting public money for charity and services infringes the devotees? fundamental right to practice their religion.He said the board will be unable to utilise the money for its services. Besides, possession of demonetised money is a criminal offence.The petition follows the Supreme Court?s directive on July 4 to the government and RBI to come up with a policy to offer a window to people who could not deposit their old notes for legitimate reasons before the December deadline.Another petition with a similar plea was filed by siblings Arushi and Apurv Jain after they found Rs 60 lakh in old notes in lockers of their parents, who died in a road accident nine years ago. They appealed for a window to exchange the money.The two were given access to the locker this March after they became adults. But the succession court in Saket gave them the permission three months after the deadline to deposit defunct notes ended.A bench of Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justice DY Chandrachud on Friday took note of the duo?s plea and asked the finance ministry to file a response within four weeks.The government recalled 500- and 1,000-rupee notes last November, wiping out 86% of the money in circulation in a cash-driven economy.Religious shrines reportedly received a surfeit of donations in old notes after the demonetisation exercise was announced. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) that runs most Sikh shrines, including the Golden Temple in Amritsar, had asked its officials not to accept defunct notes after December 30.In Jammu and Kashmir?s Vaishnodevi temple, another popular Hindu pilgrimage site, donations of Rs 1.90 crore in scrapped notes were recorded after the government?s demonetisation decision.",general,3270,60,70

Flexible material made using water tougher than steel,"Tokyo, Feb 27 (PTI) Scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. Efforts are currently underway around the world to create materials that are friendly to both society and the environment. Among them are those that comprise different materials, which exhibit the merits of each component. Researchers from Hokkaido University in Japan focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels. Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics. Researchers found that a combination of polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed earlier, and glass fibre fabric with a single fibre measuring around 10 micrometres in diameter produced a strong, tensile material. The procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in PA precursor solutions for polymerisation. When used alone, the fibre-reinforced hydrogels developed by the team are 25 times tougher than glass fibre fabric, and 100 times tougher than hydrogels - in terms of the energy required to destroy them. Combining these materials enables a synergistic toughening. The team theorises that toughness is increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fibre and hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fibres toughness increases in relation to that of the hydrogels. Consequently, the newly developed hydrogels are 5 times tougher compared to carbon steel. ""The fibre-reinforced hydrogels, with a 40 per cent water level, are environmentally friendly,"" said Jian Ping Gong, from Hokkaido University in Japan.",general,1956,53,70

In the letter, Deshpande alleges that the said company doesn't sell flats to people who eat non-vegetarian food.""We had raise this issue in BMC and had asked mayor to make a strict law so that there will not be any discrimination about not selling flats to non-vegetarian people. This proposal was unanimously passed by BMC house, but ex-mayor didn't make any law. Now, we have intensified our agitation, and in extreme case, we may take law in our hands if situation remains the same,"" said Sandeep Deshpande, MNS spokesperson.MNS workers have been asked to gather information about such builders who don't sell flats to non-vegetarian people. They will be writing letter to all such builders throughout this week. In the past, MNS had intensified its agitation against BMC's decision of shutting meat shops during Jain community festival Paryushan, and their workers had sold meat openly during that week.

Either Rahul Gandhi or I will jump in Ganga: Uma Bharti,"New Delhi, Mar 3 (PTI) Taking on Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over cleaning of the Ganga, Union Minister Uma Bharti today asked the Congress leader to refrain from making ""frivolous"" comments. Bharti, Union Minister for Water Resources, claimed the work on cleaning the river was on and lay a wager that the Congress vice president ""jumps into the river"" if positive results of the first phase of the project were not evident by 2018 ""otherwise I will jump"".

He is not aware that the entire world considers Ganga its mother,"" she said. Rahul had yesterday accused Modi of making ""conditional promises and deals"" even with ""Ganga maa"". Alleging that Modi did not only make promises to Ganga, but even struck deals with her, Gandhi said, ""Modi told Maa Ganga that first make him the Prime Minister and then he will carry out the cleaning work.""

Bharti, who heads the Modi governments ambitious Namami Gange programme as Union Minister for Water Resources, said phase I of the Clean Ganga Mission, launched in July 2016, was intended to be complete by October next year. ""Rahul says Ganga has not been cleaned yet. We will show results of phase I works in October 2018. Rahul should accompany me to Banaras then and I will show him that the work has been completed,"" Bharti told PTI over phone from Varanasi. ""If the work is complete, he should jump into the Ganga. If its not, I will. He should not make frivolous comments about Ganga.""

"After Air India, private carriers lift ban on Shiv Sena MP","A day after Air India lifted the ban on Ravindra Gaikwad, the Federation of Indian Airlines, a group of major private carriers, also revoked its ban on the Shiv Sena Member of Parliament. Gaikwad had been barred from flying by Air India and the FIA after he repeatedly hit an Air India staffer during an argument on March 23. On Friday, the Osmanabad MP wrote to the Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju expressing 'regret' for the incident, which grabbed national headlines.Following his Parliament statement, the Minsitry of Civil Aviation ordered the national carrier to lift its fly ban on Gaikwad. In a statement, Ujjawal Dey, the associate director of the FIA, said, ""Consequent to Air India restoring flying privileges to Mr. Gaikwad after being satisfied with the statement given by the Member of Parliament, the FIA member airlines are also restoring the flying privileges to Mr. Gaikwad under the assurance that our assets and colleagues shall be accorded the respect that they deserve for the hard work that they put in every day."" The FIA counts Jet Airways, Go Air, IndiGo, JetLite and SpiceJet among its members. With this, Gaikwad, who travelled to Mumbai today morning in the Rajdhani Express, is free to fly any route, any airline.

The MP was angry over not being allocated a business class seat despite having a ticket for the same. Gaikwad claimed Air India did not inform at the time of booking that his flight would not have business class seating. Minutes into the argument, Gaikwad started slapping a 60-year-old Air India staffer with his slippers. The airline registered a case with the Delhi Police and proceeded to impose a fly ban on him the next day. The following two weeks saw much controversy with private airliners joining Air India's stand even as the brazen MP refused to apologise. His party, Shiv Sena, too backed him, calling the decision of the airlines to bar him from flying unfair.",general,2209,58,70
"NIT Srinagar site hacked, hackers demand 'Free Kashmir'","In an unfortunate series of events that unfolded in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan tie in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 at Edgbaston that left the neighbours' nose bloodied, pro-Kashmir elements hacked the official website of the premier National Institute of Technology (NIT) based in Srinagar on Monday, calling for an Azaad Kashmir.NIT Srinagar became a target perhaps for the fact that it had hit headlines after a clash between Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri students last year when the latter cheered India's defeat in the T20 World Cup match against West Indies. The servers were downed after the attack.While the nation was busy grappling with an early-morning terrorist attack on a CRPF station at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Kashmir, which was foiled by jawans and left four terrorists dead, pro-Kashmir freedom elements, most probably from across the border, hacked the website of the premier institute and posted, ""Ask for milk, we shall give you sweets. Ask for Kashmir we shall kill you."" This, ironically, has been the clarion call of the Right wing, which it employs towards those asking for Kashmir's freedom.""We saw that the website had been hacked when some students tried to access it to see a few articles of the syllabus. We were shocked to see that the website bore anti-India literature, anti-Indian Armed Forces propaganda and a call to leave Kashmir and give it freedom,"" one of the students told Mail Today.WHAT THE POSTERS SAID The posters, uploaded in the name of one 'All Pak Cyber Skullz Members', said. ""We shall fight till the last breath. What shall a man not pay for living? Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in Kashmir by Indian army, a third of the deaths are children. We don't want war. Take back your guns and go back to where you came from.""""All we ask is for freedom, you can kill us, you can't kill us all, we shall not give up."" The poster went on to say: ""Giving up is not an option."" In yet another poster the hackers declared their identity as 'Hacked by SH11: Team Pak Cyber Skullz'.The poster also said, ""Go Modi Go."" To a rhetorical question - ""You know why you got hacked - which the hackers obviously wanted to answer, the poster said, ""Free Kashmir. Freedom is our goal.

Mob assaults man caught with woman in compromising position,"A 25-year-old man was battling for life on Wednesday after he was assaulted by a mob which allegedly found him in a compromising position with a woman at a government-run centre in Jharkhand?s Bokaro town, police said.The man, identified as Sakib Ansari, was unconscious when police rescued him from the mob comprising 50-odd men. Doctors said Ansari suffered multiple injuries on his head, neck, legs and back.Over the past few months, several people have been lynched in the BJP-ruled state over charges ranging from raping women, smuggling cow, and child-lifting. The latest incident took place at a Pragya Kendra, a government-run service centre that offer facilities such as linking Aadhaar number with other documents, issuing caste certificates, voter ID cards and PAN cards.

Qatar Airways plans airline in India,"Berlin/ New Delhi, Mar 8 (PTI) Qatar Airways plans to set up an airline in India along with the Gulf nations sovereign wealth fund, its chief executive Akbar Al Baker said today. This will be the first of its kind airline venture in India that would be fully-owned by overseas entities and the proposal comes nearly nine months after the Indian government allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the airlines segment. Qatar Airways, which is among the top three Gulf carriers, has been exploring investment opportunities in the fast- growing Indian aviation market. ""We are joining hands with the investment arm of State of Qatar to start a domestic airline in India with a 100 per cent investment,"" Al Baker said at a press meet in Berlin. ""We are doing this because Indian government has opened up the foreign direct investment in (setting up) an airline in India,"" he added. While announcing the plan, Al Baker said it is yet to apply to the Indian government. Last June, India allowed foreign investors -- barring overseas airlines -- to own up to 100 per cent stake in local carriers by liberalising FDI regulations. Currently, foreign airlines are allowed to invest only up to 49 per cent in Indian carriers. However, the revised norms provide room for overseas airlines to partner with a foreign non-airline player to set up a 100 per cent foreign-owned carrier in India.",general,1389,36,70
"US ends laptop ban on flights from Middle East, North Africa","The United States has ended a four-month ban on passengers carrying laptops onboard US-bound flights from certain airports in the Middle East and North Africa, bringing to an end one of the controversial travel restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump?s administration. Riyadh?s King Khalid international airport was the last of 10 airports to be exempted from the ban, the US department of homeland security (DHS) confirmed in a tweet late on Wednesday local time.With enhanced security measures in place, all restrictions on large PEDs announced in March for 10 airports/9 airlines have been lifted. Middle East carriers have blamed Trump?s travel restrictions, which include banning citizens of some Muslim-majority countries from visiting the United States, for a downturn in demand on US routes. In March, the United States banned large electronics in cabins on flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa over concerns that explosives could be concealed in the devices taken onboard aircraft. The ban has been lifted on the nine airlines affected ? Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Royal Jordanian , Kuwait Airways, EgyptAir and Royal Air Maroc ? which are the only carriers to fly direct to the US from the region. A ban on citizens of six Muslim-majority countries ? Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, ? remains in place, though has been limited after several US court hearings challenged the restrictions. ?The aviation industry has been trying to come together with a united message to governments and stakeholders about regulation and supporting the industry,? said Will Horton, senior analyst at Australian aviation consultancy CAPA. ?That was dealt a first blow from the travel ban and then a second from the large electronics ban.? Leading industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) criticised the laptop ban as ineffective, as security experts argued that militants could travel to the US via Europe or elsewhere where the restrictions did not apply. US officials lifted the ban after visiting the 10 airports in Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey over the past three weeks to confirm new security measures announced last month were being implemented. On Thursday, the US issued a revised directive to airlines around the world in response to requests that it clarify aviation security measures scheduled to start taking effect this week. The new requirements include enhanced passenger screening at foreign airports, increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas and expanded canine screening. They affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the US, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could face in-cabin electronics restrictions. The United Kingdom continues to enforce a similar in-cabin ban on electronics ban on flights from some Middle Eastern airports. Those restrictions apply to flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.",general,3174,60,70

Facebook shuts AI system after bots speak their own language,"Days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that artificial intelligence (AI) was the biggest risk, Facebook has shut down one of its AI systems after chatbots started speaking in their own language defying the codes provided.According to a report in Tech Times on Sunday, the social media giant had to pull the plug on the AI system that its researchers were working on ?because things got out of hand?. ?The AI did not start shutting down computers worldwide or something of the sort, but it stopped using English and started using a language that it created,? the report noted.Initially the AI agents used English to converse with each other but they later created a new language that only AI systems could understand, thus, defying their purpose.This led Facebook researchers to shut down the AI systems and then force them to speak to each other only in English.In June, researchers from the Facebook AI Research Lab (FAIR) found that while they were busy trying to improve chatbots, the ?dialogue agents? were creating their own language.Soon, the bots began to deviate from the scripted norms and started communicating in an entirely new language which they created without human input, media reports said.Using machine learning algorithms, the ?dialogue agents? were left to converse freely in an attempt to strengthen their conversational skills.The researchers also found these bots to be ?incredibly crafty negotiators?.?After learning to negotiate, the bots relied on machine learning and advanced strategies in an attempt to improve the outcome of these negotiations,? the report said.?Over time, the bots became quite skilled at it and even began feigning interest in one item in order to ?sacrifice? it at a later stage in the negotiation as a faux compromise,? it added.Although this appears to be a huge leap for AI, several experts including Professor Stephen Hawking have raised fears that humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, could be superseded by AI.Others like Tesla?s Elon Musk, philanthropist Bill Gates and ex-Apple founder Steve Wozniak have also expressed their concerns about where the AI technology was heading.Interestingly, this incident took place just days after a verbal spat between Facebook CEO and Musk who exchanged harsh words over a debate on the future of AI.?I?ve talked to Mark about this (AI). His understanding of the subject is limited,? Musk tweeted last week. The tweet came after Zuckerberg, during a Facebook livestream earlier this month, castigated Musk for arguing that care and regulation was needed to safeguard the future if AI becomes mainstream.?I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios -- I just, I don?t understand it. It?s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,? Zuckerberg said.Musk has been speaking frequently on AI and has called its progress the ?biggest risk we face as a civilisation?.?AI is a rare case where we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because if we?re reactive in AI regulation it?s too late,? he said.",technology,3088,60,70
Australia to build one of world's longest electric highways,"Queensland will have a 2,000km network of electric vehicle charging stations that make up one of the world?s longest electric vehicle highways within six months.The state government announced on Thursday it would build an 18-station network stretching along Queensland?s east coast from Cairns to Coolangatta and west to Toowoomba.The stations, which recharge a vehicle in 30 minutes, will offer free power for at least a year in what the environment minister, Steven Miles, said was a bid to boost the number of electric cars on Queensland roads, currently about 700.?This project is ambitious, but we want as many people as possible on board the electric vehicle revolution, as part of our transition to a low-emissions future,? Miles said.The $3m network had ?the potential to revolutionise the way we travel around Queensland in the future?, he said.Queensland?s ?electric highway? will span a comparable distance to the ?west coast electric highway? in the US, which runs from California to Oregon and Washington state. However it is dwarfed by the Trans-Canada EV highway, which, at about 8,000km, is the world?s longest.But the US in total now boasts 16,107 stations and 43,828 charging outlets, according to the US Department of Energy. Tesla drivers can reputedly make journeys of 20,000 km.The Queensland stations, which will range from the capital Brisbane to the small sugar town of Tully, would be powered with ?green energy? bought through renewable energy credits or offsets.Miles said a state household energy survey showed half of Queenslanders would consider ?an electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid or regenerative braking hybrid? when buying a new car in the next two years.While lower prices and longer-lasting batteries were driving global uptake, most in the survey said ?improvements to public fast-charging infrastructure would further tempt them into purchasing an EV?, Miles said.Car executives from Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Mitsubishi lined up to praise the move and called on other states to follow.The Audi Australia managing director, Paul Sansom, said electric car drivers travelling ?the vast distances in between our capital cities ? need to have confidence that they will be able to find a charging station when they need it, even if they?re driving in an unfamiliar region?.?This is the current expectation around frequency of petrol stations, and it?s, rightly, what consumers will demand as EVs become more prevalent.?Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, said the state government had shown ?national leadership? with ?a signal to the market that Queensland is serious about electric vehicles?.This gave the industry ?certainty to unlock investment to grow our economy and create new, high skilled jobs?, he said.?I encourage all governments across Australia to follow suit, particularly as this support will help to provide motorists with increased choice of cars that are cheaper and healthier to operate.?Queensland is Australia?s biggest carbon polluter, with the transport sector making up the state?s second largest source of carbon emissions with 21.1m tonnes in 2014, having almost doubled since 1990.Passenger cars make up almost half of transport emissions, according to the state environment department.The $3m contract to build the network has been awarded to Brisbane technology company Tritium, which began as a solar car racing parts manufacturer.",world,3459,59,70
"Branson sells 31% stake in Virgin Atlantic for ?1,800 crore","The potential end of an era looms in British aviation after Sir Richard Branson announced he is selling 31% of Virgin Atlantic, relinquishing his controlling interest in the airline he founded in 1984.Branson will net £220m from the deal to sell the 31% stake to Air France-KLM and remain as chairman of the airline. He retains a 20% interest, leaving the US giant Delta as the largest shareholder in Virgin Atlantic with 49%.Virgin Atlantic is expected to retain its independence as a UK airline and will continue to fly under the Virgin brand.The deal forms part of an extensive tie-up on lucrative transatlantic routes announced by Virgin, Delta and Air France-KLM on Thursday. The three airlines, along with ailing Italian carrier Alitalia, will join together in a single joint venture on flights between Europe and the US, co-operating on schedules and frequent flyer schemes ? an alliance that will step up competition with the partnership between American Airlines and Branson?s great rival, British Airways.Branson said it was ?a fantastic opportunity to extend our network and create a stronger customer champion, as well as being extremely beneficial to our people and the Virgin Atlantic brand?. The 67-year-old entrepreneur, probably the most famous face in the modern aviation industry, started out by chartering and selling seats on his first plane when a flight was cancelled in the Caribbean. He later positioned his Virgin Atlantic airline as an exciting, glamorous upstart trying to break the grip of a stuffy BA on UK aviation. That rivalry intensified in the ?dirty tricks? battle in the 1980s, which saw Branson win a large libel settlement from BA. He later presented the airline?s first tie-up with Delta, announced in 2012, as a response to the national carrier?s dominance from Heathrow to the US. Delta bought a 49% stake in Virgin in 2013 ? a move that BA?s chief executive, Willie Walsh, predicted would end in Branson ceding control within five years.Virgin Atlantic edged into profit from 2014 to 2016, but had forecast losses this year on the back of the Brexit referendum and the fall in sterling.In a letter to staff on Thursday, Branson said it was an exciting day for the airline, and said he would still remain as the largest individual shareholder, adding that his new partners all agreed the brand should survive. But he noted that the airline had been operating for half his lifetime, and added: ?As I get a little older, I want to be certain that all the necessary building blocks are in place for Virgin Atlantic to continue to prosper and grow for the next 50 years. ?The airline industry has consolidated over Virgin Atlantic?s lifetime and it?s now our turn to put ourselves at the heart of an important alliance ... With these three partners in place and with me ? and one day, the wider Branson family ? still very much involved, we have the foundations to make sure this is so.?Atlanta-based Delta already had a joint venture with Air France-KLM dating back to 2009, including Alitalia from 2010.Delta also announced on Thursday it would buy a 10% stake in Air France-KLM for ?375m (£335m), as will China Eastern, with both joining the European airline conglomerate?s board, subject to regulatory approval.",business,3254,59,70
AAP fined ?27L for 'unauthorised occupation' of Delhi office,"The Aam Aadmi Party has landed in a fresh controversy related to its party office. The Delhi government's PWD department has served a notice on the political group to pay Rs 27 lakh as fine for having failed to vacate its Rouse Avenue office within the stipulated time.Mail Today is in possession of a copy of the notice served to the Aam Aadmi Party.The notice was served on Tuesday in reply to the party's plea in which party requested to continue its operations from the 206, Rouse Avenue address. It was addressed to the Aam Aadmi Party's national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta.The letter written by deputy secretary, Debasis Biswal mentions that there is no provision under the rules to extend the ""illegal occupation"". Hence, the party is liable to pay a penal rent for the period of unauthorised occupation, says the notice.RS 27 LAKH FINE The amount which has been calculated by the department up to May 31 amounts to Rs 27,73,802, says the letter. The letter further says that the dues will further accrue up to the date the premises are finally vacated.In another notice, the government also turned down the proposal of party in which it asked for an alternative accommodation before vacating the Rouse Avenue office.Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, in early April, had cancelled the allotment of 206, Rouse Avenue premises as the party office of AAP. The bungalow was allocated through a state cabinet decision of the Aam Aadmi Party last year.In an earlier communication to the government, L-G Anil Baijal had communicated to the government that he was within his right to cancel the allocation of the office as it had been usurped by violating the rules.In a note written to the Government which has challenged LG order Baijal has written that it is a clear case of conflict of interest as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also the convenor of Aam Aadmi Party and hence action can be taken on that front as well.",general,1931,60,70

China can cede Aksai Chin if India does in east: Ex-diplomat,"China's long-time negotiator on the border talks, who retired in 2013, has said that Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh is an ""inalienable"" part of Tibet and that a boundary settlement would not be possible unless India agreed to make concessions in the eastern sector.But if India did so, China would also make concessions in Aksai Chin, suggested Dai Bingguo, spelling out in detail for the first time his thoughts on a solution.Dai, who was the Special Representative on the boundary issue for 15 rounds of talks until his retirement in 2013, said that India ""held the key"" to the settlement and that if it took into account China's concerns in the eastern sector, Beijing would similarly do so in other areas.THE DISPUTE India sees China as occupying 38,000 sq km of its territory in Aksai Chin, while China claims 90,000 sq km in Arunachal Pradesh.Dai, who recently penned his memoirs, told the Beijing-based China-India Dialogue magazine, published by the official China International Publishing Group, in an interview: ""The disputed territory in the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, including Tawang, is inalienable from China's Tibet in terms of cultural background and administrative jurisdiction.""He said it was not until February 1951 that ""the local government of Tibet [was] forced to stop its actual administration of Tawang"". ""Even the British colonialists who drew the illegal 'McMahon Line' respected China's jurisdiction over Tawang,"" he said.Dai added: ""The major reason the boundary question persists is that China's reasonable requests [in the east] have not been met"".""If the Indian side takes care of China's concerns in the eastern sector of their border,"" he said, ""the Chinese side will respond accordingly and address India's concerns elsewhere.""Despite his emphasis on Tawang, Dai suggested that the 15 rounds of talks he participated in had moved both sides close to ""a political settlement"". His comments suggest this would involve mutual adjustments or concessions, most likely in Tawang and Aksai Chin.""China and India are now standing in front of the gate towards a final settlement,"" he said. ""The gate is a framework solution based on meaningful and mutually accepted adjustments. Now, the Indian side holds the key to the gate.""The 19th round of talks was held between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and State Councillor Yang Jiechi, Dai's successor as SR, in Beijing last April.WATCH: Why have violations on India-China border dropped in last 5 years?ALSO READ: PLA banner in Ladakh says 'You are in China' but government insists no intrusion",general,2589,60,70
UK school bans Fitbits as kids skip meals over calorie count,"A girls? school is banning wearable activity trackers and smartwatches because of concerns that pupils are skipping lunch if they fail to meet their calorie and exercise targets.Teachers at Stroud high school in Gloucestershire fear the gadgets are exacerbating some girls? worries about their body image. The deputy headteacher, Cindi Pride, said the school?s active and healthy pupils did not need to count calories and the number of steps they took each day. She said: ?We are banning Fitbits and smartwatches. These monitor the number of calories burned and we found that some girls would monitor the number of steps they had taken and the number of calories they had used. If they didn?t feel they had taken enough steps in the morning, they wouldn?t eat lunch.?We don?t need our girls to be counting calories. They are young women who are fit and healthy and they do exercise and PE, and do not need to be obsessed with steps or calories.? The move was welcomed ? with reservations ? by a former pupil of the school, Rachel Cross, who had an eating disorder and has set up a support group in Stroud for other people who have similar conditions. She said: ?With young girls it?s very difficult to say if something will lead to an eating disorder or not; using things like Fitbits can just be a cool thing for them to do.?I think I agree with it, but I do have reservations over whether it will actually prevent anyone from getting a disorder if they are on that path anyway. It?s potentially a good precaution to take. If it?s distracting them from work, it?s a good idea anyway. ?It will be interesting to see how it works out. Pupils always try to bend the rules anyway, for example on the length of skirts.?Parents appeared to be on board. One said: ?This is a good move, which addresses important issues in an appropriate and measured way.? When pupils return from their summer break, girls in years 7 to 9 will be banned from using their mobile phones at all during the school day.Those in years 10 and 11 will be allowed to use their mobiles at lunch, and pupils in the sixth form ? which includes boys ? will be allowed to use their phones freely except in lessons. In a letter to parents, the assistant headteacher, Nadine Moore, wrote that fear of missing out was an additional pressure faced by teens through social media. She wrote: ?Being a teenager is hard enough, but the pressures faced by young people online are unique to this digital generation. ?Research suggests that young people who are heavy users of social media ? spending more than two hours per day on social networking sites ? are more likely to report poor mental health. ?Seeing friends constantly ?having fun? can make young people feel like they are missing out while others enjoy life. ?While for many young people fear of missing out (Fomo) may not be a problem, for others it is causing them distress in the form of anxiety and feelings of inadequacy.? Pupils were told about the tight new controls at a school assembly. The letter home added: ?Social media addiction is thought to affect around 5% of young people, with social media being described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol.?Remember, this will give your daughters nearly seven hours of freedom from the pressures of social media. For their time in school, they will not have to worry about ?missing out?, or replying quickly enough or knowing about who said what to whom. ?Instead, we will be able to remember that we have real friends in front of us, right now, who we can talk to, play with, have fun with, laugh with. We can share experiences together and value them in their own right, rather than because the picture has been validated by 100 likes on whichever social media platform they use.?",general,3762,60,70
"Been working since I was 19, so break was torturous: Akshaye","impact Mumbai, Jun 25 (PTI) Actor Akshaye Khanna, who has starred as a lead in several films, says he has consciously decided to take up smaller but effective roles in his second innings in Bollywood. Akshaye was recently seen as a baddie in Varun Dhawan- John Abraham starrer ""Dishoom"" and is now busy promoting his next film ""Mom"" that features Sridevi in the lead. ""I decided, having taken an off of four years, I wanted to start off with slightly smaller roles to get into that zone. But I was sure I wont do it by compromising on the quality of work. The role could be small, but it should have an impact in the story,"" Akshaye told PTI. Akshaye, 42, who has been working since the age of 19, was away from the silver screen for four years due to personal reasons. The actor says he felt tortured while he was not doing films. ""There was a reason why I took a sabbatical. I had some personal reasons which didnt allow me to work. But there has never been a point in my life where I wanted to take things slow, or I dont want to work. ""Besides work (acting), there is nothing I know or can do. I have been working nonstop since I was 19 so not working is torturous. That phase has gone now."" Even though he was away from films for a while but Akshaye refrains from calling the phase as his comeback. ""I wont say its my comeback. There were some reasons because of which I couldnt work. Now, it doesnt matter what adjectives people give it. I am enjoying working now. ""I am glad people enjoyed my role in Dishoom and my role in Mom is fantastic. In a way, both Nawazuddin Siddiqui (co-star) and I have extended cameos in the film.

"Cricket Aus threatens to stop pay, players threaten strike","Australia's cricket board has warned players will not be given alternative contracts if they fail to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement in an escalation of a protracted and increasingly bitter pay dispute.Australia's professional cricketers rejected a pay offer from the sport's governing body last month, saying the proposal was ""a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket"".CA released their proposal in March, offering large salary increases, particularly for women, but breaking with the 20-year model of a fixed percentage of revenue from the game going to the cricketers.James Sutherland told the players' association that they needed to meet terms with CA or players would go unpaid when the existing collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30.""In the absence of the ACA (Australian Cricketers' Association) negotiating a new MoU (Memorandum of Understanding), players with contracts expiring in 2016-17 will not have contracts for 2017-18,"" Sutherland said in a letter received by the ACA on Friday.""To be very clear, in the absence of a new MOU, CA is not contemplating alternative contracting arrangements to pay players beyond 30 June if their contracts have expired.""Cricket Australia declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters.The ACA said in response that the ""threats... were a window into the nature of CA's behaviour in these negotiations so far.""""There is incoherence and aggression in what we have experienced at the negotiating table from CA,"" ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson said in a statement on Sunday.""This has further been demonstrated this week with some top players being offered multi-years deals one day only to now be threatened the next.""The ACA has asked CA to go into mediation talks to try to end a dispute that has rumbled for over six months.Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc hinted at a players' strike for the upcoming Ashes, the lucrative five-test series against England which starts in November.""Makes for an interesting men's and women's ashes,"" Starc wrote on Twitter.Former test all-rounder Shane Watson responded: ""Well said @mstarc56 (Starc).

26-year-old with 'wrinkled' skin disorder turns model,"One look at her and it appears she is wearing a full-sleeve high-neck. Perhaps it?s a size larger than her own because it wrinkles on her neck, down her stomach and inner sides of her arms. Look closer at 26-year-old Sara Geurts and you realise that?s not a piece of clothing but ripples that adorn her skin. The aspiring model from Minneapolis, Minnesota was only 10 years old when she was diagnosed with a rare type of skin disorder, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, reported mirror.co.uk, that causes skin and joints to stretch beyond normal. A post shared by Sara Geurts (@sarageurts) on May 1, 2017 at 10:37am PDT Sara first noticed something different about her body, says the report, when she was just seven. Because of little information and awareness about the skin problem, Sara had to undergo numerous tests before it was established that she had the disorder that was causing severe acne and sores on the top of her hairline and making the skin on her body loose and stretchy. Struggling with low self-esteem and body image issues, Sara would hide her skin under baggy clothes to avoid drawing attention to herself, while her friends wore whatever they wanted to. ?I wasn?t bullied and my family and friends were very supportive, but I hated my skin. I was lucky I didn?t get any nasty remarks,? the report quotes. A post shared by Sara Geurts (@sarageurts) on Jun 22, 2017 at 10:36am PDT The turning point came in 2015 when, after a break up, Sara submitted a photo of herself to a Tumblr page ?Love Your Lines? that encourages women to embrace their stretch marks, scars and other imperfections.Her photo garnered 25,000 likes and that was the beginning of her love affair with herself. Her perception of her body changed. She realised that her imperfections make her unique and that gave birth to a new Sara. ?Each imperfection you have is individual to you,? Sara said in a video interview to Barcroft TV, ?and it tells a story about you and who you are, and the struggle and the journey that you have been on.??We are in the generation of albinism models. We have melanin models. We have vitiligo models. We have plus size models. And those are all fabulous things. But the one thing that we are really missing are people with disorders within our everyday commercials,? said Sara.",lifestyle,2294,53,70

US kills 12 Afghan police officers in friendly-fire,"A US gunship has killed at least 12 Afghan policemen in a friendly fire airstrike in Helmand, according to local officials.The incident is a setback for the US-Afghan fight against the Taliban in the embattled province, and comes as the US administration and its Nato allies are preparing the deployment of several thousand additional troops to Afghanistan.Since 2001, Helmand has consistently been the deadliest province for both foreign and Afghan forces. Since the international drawdown in 2014, the Taliban has seized territory across the province, leaving the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, and the economic hub, Gereshk, as some of the only areas still in government hands. The attack occurred on Friday afternoon, when, according to local police sources, an Afghan police unit retook a checkpoint captured by the Taliban on Thursday. Due to apparent miscommunication, a US gunship bombed the police unit 30 minutes later, according to police sources.The spokesman to the provincial governor, Omar Zawak, said the number of killed and injured was not yet clear. Helmand?s police chief said 12 members of the Afghan National Security Forces died in the strike. The incident followed a week of intensified US airstrikes in Helmand. The US air campaign in Afghanistan has reached a level not seen since 2012, when there were almost 10 times as many US troops in the country.According to Bill Salvin, spokesman for the coalition forces in Afghanistan, the US has conducted more than 50 airstrikes in the province over the past five days. In June, the US surpassed the total number of aerial attacks in Afghanistan last year, with 1,634 airstrikes conducted primarily in the south ? in and around Helmand ? and against Islamic State groups in the east. Following Friday?s incident, the coalition forces said in a statement: ?We can confirm local security personnel aligned with Afghan government forces were killed in an airstrike in Gereshk district in Helmand province late this afternoon.? ?During a US supported [Afghan defence forces] operation, aerial fires resulted in the deaths of the friendly Afghan forces who were gathered in a compound? An investigation will be conducted to determine the specific circumstances that led to this incident.?The deaths in Helmand added to a particularly bloody day for the Afghan police. In the northeastern Badakhshan province, the Taliban killed at least 32 members of the local police and government-aligned uprising groups in a push to capture Tagaq district. Some of the people killed were murdered after the Taliban surrounded a house they were staying in, while the rest were shot in an ambush, said Abdullah Naji Nazari, the head of the provincial council.

I'd say let?s meet at next station in real life: SRK on DDLJ,"Just one look, a dimpled smile and outstretched arms are all that Shah Rukh Khan needs to personify the ultimate lover on screen, but the reality is different says the superstar who describes himself as ?pathetic?, ?detached? and ?demotional? when it comes to romance and relationships.In an interview with PTI, Shah Rukh says, ?I am pathetic with relationships. I am so pathetic that I am comic.??If somebody said what did you say to him or her when he or she said this, my answer would shock you. They are like ?but how could you?? and I say, ?I don?t know how else to relate to this.? I am very bad with relationships, I am awful.?Unlike his characters on screen who travel continents to profess love, Shah Rukh prefers to hide his emotions.?I am extremely one-sided, perhaps even selfish. Actually, I am very detached. I am demotional - emotional and detached, I don?t know how it works. I won?t be able to say anything that I?ve done in my films to a girl, or even in relationships...?I am extremely closeted, introverted, shy, reclusive and completely shut off about my emotions.?And this dichotomy is perhaps what helps him play the romantic hero as he believes that an actor is normally attracted to roles that he is not in real life.?I don?t have to believe in it, I have to make you believe in it and that?s a challenge always... An actor always goes for something that he is not. It?s a vent. I want to be a Batman, a Spider-Man, a fire fighter, an evil conniving don and I want to be the greatest lover in the world. And I am not any of these.

Canadian fisherman killed by whale moments after rescuing it,"A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed ? moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the province?s eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. The rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north Atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the Gulf of St Lawrence, off Canada. With a global population believed to be around 525, the string of deaths suggests that more than 1% of the population has died in recent weeks. Howlett helped free the whale ? only to be struck by the mammal moments later, said Mackie Green of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team. ?They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,? Green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the Canadian Press.Howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free. Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. ?Joe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,? said Green, who joined forces with Howlett to launch the whale rescue in 2002. ?This is something he loved and there?s no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.?On Tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that Howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an ?irreplaceable member of the whale rescue community?.In a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two. ?Taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals,? it noted. ?There are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.?Howlett?s death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north Atlantic right whales in the past month. A team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales ? which live along the eastern seaboard of Canada and the US and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length ? are dying in large numbers. Last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. While their findings are still preliminary and don?t explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks.",world,2957,60,70
Drugs worth ?300 cr seized in Kashmir,"In a major drug bust, the Baramulla Police today seized 66.5 kilograms of suspected heroin worth Rs 300 crore from a truck that originated from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The truck was purportedly carrying boxes full of garments, but hidden among the boxes were packets of narcotics. The truck, numbered AJK XA-267, originated from Muzzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and was headed towards Uri in Kashmir. Officials posted at the LoC Trade Centre in Salamabad, Uri, who were already on the lookout for such a truck after receiving intelligence inputs about the movement of drugs, stopped the lorry and carried out a search, which led to the recovery of the narcotics.The driver of the truck - a PoK man named Syed Yousuf - has been arrested, but officials believe he is just a small-time operative.

According to news agency PTI, the event was organised by a local unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party and also saw participation from the area's MLA. PTI also reported that the the two ministers were seen shaking hands with around 100 exorcists who were present at the felicitation ceremony.

DDA to submit action plan for restoring Yamuna floodplains,"The restoration of Yamuna floodplains could start soon with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directing the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and irrigation department of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to submit an action plan within a week.A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar formed a three-member committee comprising a senior official of the DDA and chief engineers of the irrigation department of Delhi and UP to prepare the plan. ?The committee shall submit an action plan with reference to floodplains of Yamuna where Art of Living?s event was held last year,? the bench said.The tribunal also directed the committee to consult and refer to the findings and suggestions of the expert panel, appointed by NGT earlier, before submitting the restoration action plan. A three-day Word Culture Festival was organised on the river?s floodplains by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar?s Art of Living in March 2016. An expert committee appointed by the green body had claimed that the ecology of over 420 acres of floodplains was adversely affected by the event. The panel suggested that it would require over Rs 42 crore to execute the plan. Art of Living, however, had challenged the findings on multiple grounds and even appointed its own panel of experts to prepare a parallel report to substantiate their claims. ?Let the restoration work begin. The cost can be debited to the account of whoever is responsible for the damage. We can?t ask the DDA to sit on the report submitted by the expert committee,? the bench observed. The matter would be heard again on a day-to-day basis from July 28 onwards. The action plan would have to be submitted by July 28. The expert committee earlier appointed by the tribunal suggested they would need the help of aquatic plants and animals that once used to inhabit the river?s floodplains to fix the ecological damage. The report had stated that huge de-siltation and dredging would be required to ?physically? rehabilitate the network of wetlands and channels that were damaged and destroyed.

According to 2011 figures, a Bihar legislator draws a monthly salary of Rs 1 lakh and it appears that this huge salary added with privileges and perks is not enough for these two ministers who are renting out their official bungalow for commercial purpose.Opposition leader and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has criticized Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for allowing his ministers to rent out their official bungalows for weddings and parties. He demanded sacking of both ministers from the Cabinet.""Both ministers have turned their official bungalows into banquet halls. Both are earning crores by renting out their bungalows. Nitish should sack them and FIR should be registered against them. Nitish has also attended marriages in these bungalows. No way can the ministers make commercial use of the official bungalows,"" said Sushil Modi. Both ministers, however, remained unavailable for comments.",general,1754,59,70
