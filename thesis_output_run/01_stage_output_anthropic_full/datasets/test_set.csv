We have said that it is only after we verify the details, can we issue an emergency certificate for their deportation.""

She said the Foreign Secretary had met US Congress members who had been all praise for Indians.'OLD CONCERNS PACKAGED NEW' Even in 2012, a figure had come that 11.43 lakh migrants lived there, of whom 2.60 lakh were Indians. ""We did not accept the figure because it cannot be considered authentic without thorough verification,"" she said.She said ""there are no authentic figures on the number of undocumented Indian immigrants in the US"", adding that the government provided travel documents only after the concerned person was conclusively identified as Indian.""In case we don't provide travel documents, they would be jailed,"" Swaraj said, adding that from 2014 till date, 576 people have been provided travel documents.Responding to questions on social security, she said these issues have been raised in the past and can be taken up again later ""as you say right now a sword is hanging on jobs"".On H1B visas, she said there have been ""flip-flops"" in the past and the number of these visas rose from 65,000 to 1.95 lakh and then again went down to 65,000.

Accompanied by BJP leader Shaina NC, Nath met Fadnavis on Friday. He alleged inaction by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had led to Kanchan?s death and demanded a case be lodged against those responsible. Nath complained that in February this year, the owner of the plot had approached the BMC to cut the tree. The civic body inspected it and decided on pruning some of the branches of the dead tree instead of cutting it. The owner had even paid for the pruning, he said. READ:?Husband demands FIR against BMC officialsIf the BMC had paid heed to the application and cut the dead tree, the incident would not have occurred. Fadnavis assured Nath and his family members, who accompanied him, that action has been initiated against the garden department of BMC. Kanchan, a former television news reader with Doordarshan, was on her way home from her yoga classes last Thursday when the tree fell on her, injuring her neck, at Kurla Road near Swastik Park at Chembur East. Nath was rushed to the hospital by vendors who were around at the time of the incident. She died three days later .Falling trees in the monsoon is one of the biggest hazards in the city. Experts have blamed the haphazard way in which authorities pruned trees and the concretisation around the roots, which make the trees weak, as the main causes of these falls.

Muslims protest plan to make marriage registration mandatory,"As the Uttar Pradesh government is planning to make marriage registration mandatory, Muslims are getting ready to come out on the roads in protest of this 'un-Islamic' move.Talking to India Today on this issue, Muslim leader Haji Jameeluddin said the Muslim community cannot accept the UP government's edict to register Muslim marriages at the marriage registrar's office as Muslim marriages are only registered at the office of the Waqf board of UP as per the Nikahnama documents.He said Muslim marriages are already registered according to the Sharia law and there was no need to register them again merely to satisfy a government's whim.He said the attention of both the Centre and the state governments have shifted from development and crime control to such frivolous issues. This is merely to divert the attention of the people from the issues raging before the country, which the Muslims will not tolerate.Bhartiya Muslim Vikas Parishad chairman Sami Aghai said that the Yogi government seeks to keep the Hindus and Muslims of UP tied up in such petty issues so that they never raise their demand for development. He said that similar issue came up during the Samajwadi Party government as well but the Muslims did not let it gain prominence with their protests and the Akhilesh Yadav government had to shelve this topic.Former president of the Muslim wing of Samajwadi Party Md Yaseen Qureshi said Muslim marriages get registered at the time they are solemnised so Muslims do not need an additional registration, whereas most Hindu marriages are conducted without any paperwork.Mufti Mudassar Ali Qadri said that Muslim marriages are conducted according to Sharia, which is why the Muslim personal law has been defined separately in the Indian Constitution. The Qazi who conducts these marriages is registered with the state government and he has to present the statistics of marriages conducted by him in a year to the state government, he said.However, BJP leader Ashfaq Saifi claimed that since the order had not been given by the state government, but it was given by the Supreme Court, the Muslims as well as the state government, were duty bound to honour the Court's will. He said that some Muslim leaders are unnecessarily dragging the name of Yogi Adityanath in this matter, whereas the Chief Minister has issued an order to make all the marriages mandatory, irrespective of the religion. The rules are still being prepared by the women welfare department of the state government and as soon as the rules are ready, they will be brought into effect.Saifi said that whoever declines to obey these rules, shall be barred from availing government benefits, while those who register their marriages after a delay, shall be liable for a fine.Clearing confusion on this issue, senior advocate Md Arif said if a Muslim deposits his Nikahnama at the registrar's office, it will be deemed as a marriage registration and even if that copy is deposited by the Qazi who conducted the Nikah, the registration will be deemed effective.",politics,3039,60,70

Idea of annual spectrum auction progressive: Airtel's Mittal,"From Prasoon Srivastava Barcelona, Mar 2 (PTI) The governments proposal to auction spectrum every year has got a backer in Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, who however has said there is no need for sale of airwaves in coming fiscal. ""The way he (telecom secretary) has put it that spectrum auction will be done every year whether industry needs it or not is very progressive thought. In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal told PTI in an interview. J S Deepak, as the Telecom Secretary, a couple of days ago said the government is looking at making spectrum auction an annual event and will reach out to sector regulator Trai for its recommendations. He had said the government plans to provide industry with an option to buy spectrum every year irrespective of their interest so that there is never a shortage of spectrum in providing quality mobile services. Deepak, a 1982-batch IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who at present is at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, has been shifted with ""immediate effect"" from the telecom ministry and made officer on special duty in the commerce department. Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone ""out of control"" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18. He, however, has said that even though telecom operators are bleeding with the entrance of a new service provider, they will need to increase investment in networks to handle competition. ""You have to accelerate market spends. You need to put more capex. We have done 85,000 base stations last year, 80,000 base stations this year. This is largest rollout anywhere in the world. There will be more investment on 4G side,"" Mittal said. Bharti Airtel had reported an over 54 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 503.7 crore for the December quarter due to what it had termed as ""turbulence from predatory pricing by a new operator"". The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains ""healthy and strong"" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can ""never say never"". He maintained that with improvement in technology, the cost of network is not linear. Mittal further said Huawei and ZTE have a massive mimo technology using which one can quadruple or probably go up to 8 times of existing capacities in the spectrum. ""Nice good innovation is happening on the network side where you can generate nice good capacities than in the past. Technology is also coming to help. Its not that if I have got 2000 TB of capacity and I have to move to 5000, I have to double my investments. Its probably 20 per cent more,"" Mittal said.",general,2731,60,70

However, the BCCI initiated a hunt for a new coach and many felt it was because the board was unhappy with his role in salary negotiations for the players with the CoA.Since it is a volatile situation, the CoA is understood to play it carefully, especially as India are days away from the Champions Trophy.Back in 2007, Australian Greg Chappell's tenure as India coach had come to an end following a public spat with Ganguly and complaints from several other senior cricketers. In the decade that followed, the likes of Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh have spoken out about the tough times the team endured under Chappell.Unlike Chappell, however, Kumble, has delivered the results. Under his command, India have not lost any series and Chesteshwar Pujara, who was going through a slump midway into 2016, finished the last season as the most prolific of Test batsmen.The BCCI, in a press release issued on May 25, merely stated that a nominee of the CoA would oversee the process of appointing the next coach to ensure transparency.",sports,2088,60,70

"Woman, her brother-in-law tonsured, paraded in Bihar: Report","In a shameful incident right under the nose of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, few strongmen from the Dalit community passed a diktat of tonsuring the head of a Dalit woman and her brother -in-law suspecting an illicit relation between the two. The Talibani diktat was passed and later executed on 22nd February in the Machriyawan village in Fatuha, about 30 kms from Patna. The two were later paraded in front of the entire village after their heads were tonsured.The Dalit woman Soni Devi with her baby and her brother-in-law Shailendra Ram were abused and their faces blackened while they were paraded in the village. After facing massive humiliation from people of her own community, Soni Devi left the village after the incident.Surprisingly, the local police remained unaware about the entire incident for 11 days. When, the matter came to light a couple of days ago, the police hunted for the Dalit woman and her brother-in-law and on their complaint filed an FIR against the 5 accused persons, of which three are women. Police have arrested two persons Jageshwar and Rajdev in connection with this case. The three women accused however are still at large and the police are looking out for them.""The incident took place on 22nd February.

"1200 laws repealed in last 3 yrs, 1301 in 65 yrs before that","Under the Indian Motor Vehicles Act 1914, an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth, and will be disqualified if he has a pigeon chest, knock knees, flatfeet and hammer toes.This is one among a tangle of bizarre, archaic laws, which survived for years like a relic in a museum but with no relevance in modern India.Many of these rules put up obstacles to running smooth administration and ease to do business. The Narendra Modi government had made it clear at its inception that it was time for these dinosaurs to go extinct.Among the myriad laws in India, there are those that made strange demands. A century-old one said the toll tax for boats ferrying passengers across the river Ganga cannot be more than two annas - a denomination not in use any more.According to another one, policemen in some states have to ensure that air-dropped pamphlets do not fall in their areas. This was aimed to foil the propaganda campaign during World War II.A 200-year-old law allowed the British monarch to review decisions of all Indian courts. But these Acts are now history.OLD LAWS SWIFTLY SCRAPPED The Modi government is creating a record of sorts in scrapping these old, redundant and archaic laws from statute books.While successive governments could remove just 1,301 obsolete laws which came in the way of smooth administration and economic growth in 65 years, the present central government has managed to weed out as many as 1,200 Acts in just three years. As many as 1,824 more obsolete central Acts have been identified for repeal.The Opposition-dominated Upper House too played its part when it passed the bills concerning repeal of 1,159 central laws. The Rajya Sabha passed four such bills.""The Modi government is determined to relegate several archaic Acts to history. Laws need to be consonant with the times. 1,200 redundant Acts have been scrapped. 1,824 more have been identified for repeal,"" said law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.Before this, under the Indian Aircraft Act, 1934, kites were also aircraft and you needed to obtain a permit as required for an aeroplane.Under the Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878 you could have been jailed if you found anything worth more than Rs 10 and did not report it to a revenue officer. POLL PROMISEDuring the 2014 election campaign, Modi promised that if the BJP came to power, for every law passed, his government would repeal 10 obsolete ones.Laws on licence to kill and capture of wild elephants in certain circumstances, segregation and medical treatment of lepers, regulating the grant of titles to qualified persons in western medical science and prohibition of pledging of labour of children (child slavery) are among those abolished.Also have been dumped some archaic rules regulating recruitment of foreigners during pre-Independence period, agreement with Pakistan on exchange of prisoners, continuation of use of courts in Bengal, Assam and Punjab for those who migrated to Pakistan and power to regulate prices of newspapers. There were many more laws in the statute books which had been of no use as provisions of most of the old Acts had already been incorporated in new legislation.But time is running out for such laws. The government had formed a committee headed by R Ramanujam, secretary to the prime minister's office, to re-examine all Acts recommended to be repealed by the earlier committee on Review of Administrative Laws set up by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1998.After taking the help of the Law Commission, the panel is submitting periodic reports.

Of the 437 punished personnel, seven were inspectors, 73 sub-inspectors, 19 assistant sub-inspectors, 65 head constables and 271 were constables. ?The sharp decline in complaints received against police personnel is a result of the sustained emphasis laid by us and prompt inquiry into complaints followed by swift punitive action on substantiated allegations. The force has adopted a zero-tolerance policy against corruption, inaction and misbehaviour by police personnel. The perception created among staff that if found guilty, they will not be spared has helped us contain corruption in the department,? said Dependra Pathak, Delhi Police spokesperson.

Felt I was forced to dance but started enjoying it: Siddiqui,"Mumbai, Jun 5 (PTI) Tiger Shroff said if Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is a powerhouse performer, starts dancing as well then other actors jobs will be in trouble.

JioPhone at effectively ?0 clever marketing: Industry body,"New Delhi, Jul 21 (PTI) Industry body COAI today termed the launch of JioPhone a ""clever marketing"" and said Jio selling the device at effective zero price is an attempt to save government levies like licence fee by the company. The Reliance Jios new 4G-enabled feature phone at a fully refundable one-time payment of Rs 1,500 will offer free voice calls to customers with unlimited data when they recharge their account for Rs 24 onward whereas the full-month service will cost Rs 153 only. COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said the Jios announcement is a bundled offer and the plan to sell it at an ""effective zero price"" is a ""clever marketing position"" as the move will help the company save licence fee and other government levies. ""Previously, when you bundled handset along with services the 14 or 11 per cent that an operator paid as licence fee got imposed on handsets. So as an operator one cant compete with a handset seller because handset seller is not required to pay this extra levy of 11-14 per cent,"" Mathews said. He said a bundled offer would have increased cost of providing service for operators. ""Reliance Jio offer is clever marketing position... they are saying the handset price is effectively zero. So no licence fee, spectrum usage charge has to be paid on that. Government will have to look at what sale of price for zero means,"" Mathews said. Mathews termed the todays launch as ""clearly a big win for Jio"" that will put pressure on incumbent telecom operators as well as on handset makers to match the offer and cable service providers. Mathews, however, said this might have a bit of adverse impact for Jio as well. ""For existing (Jio) consumers who are already paying Rs 303 and above, unless they want to spend additional Rs 1,500, there is no impact. Of the 120 million customers, some of them might switch to this new plan. In such cases, there will be dilution for Jio from customers paying Rs 303 moving to Rs 153,"" Mathews said. He said that with this launch, data usage is expected to significantly increase. ""There will be a shift also from 2G to 4G. The whole game is going to shift again to high volume, low margin. If you go to that segment where device price was impediment from switching to 4G from 2G, clearly this helps them. But competition is not going to stay put,"" Mathews said. He said handset manufacturers will have to scramble to compete with Rs 1,500 handset. A top official of a leading telecom company said it is too early to assess the impact of the new offering. He said that customers may prefer to have choices rather than being ""locked into"" into a handset for three years. Also, the offer at Rs 153 a month needs to be seen in the context of three years and whether the consumers are prepared to commit themselves to such an outgo on a monthly basis, he added. At present, the average revenue from feature phone subscribers is up to Rs 100 a month, said the official who did not wish to be named. Mobile phone companies body Indian Cellular Association (ICA) termed it as a disruptive move that will expand scope of 4G technology in the country. ""It is a very well crafted package to enable entry-level subscribers to step into the digital data revolution. This package will be a catalyst also for spreading 4G networks into the deeper hinterland,"" Indian Cellular Association National President Pankaj Mohindroo said.",business,3388,58,70
Central Delhi air has considerable PM1 pollutant: Study,"A recent study has found a substantial presence in the ultrafine particulate matter PM1, a dangerous pollutant, in Central Delhi.The PM 1 particle is 70 times finer than the thickness of a human hair, goes directly into the bloodstream and is potentially more dangerous than the more well known PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants. And no one knows how much of it is in the air we breathe.The Lodhi Road monitoring station of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences has recorded the average volume of PM1 during summer, winter and the monsoon at about 46, 49 and 20 micrograms per cubic metres, respectively. The data from the year 2016 is collected in the only station that has the technology, says Gufran Beig, project director of SAFAR.The safe standards of PM1 have not been defined yet, in the absence of which its potentially harmful effects have not been documented. Globally, too, there might not be a standard but PM1 is considered the most dangerous among all particulate matter, particularly because of its size. It measures around 1 micron or less in diameter and can enter deep into the lungs and bloodstream.According to a Central Pollution Control Board 2010 study, small particulate matter can reach the alveolar region, causing heart ailments. These fine particles cover a large surface area, absorb toxic compounds such as heavy metals and organic compounds with high carbon content, the study said.These particles ? spewed primarily from vehicles, factories and construction sites ? are not dispersed and stay suspended in the air.But why is the air in Central Delhi flooded with these particulates??PM1 is a major product of vehicular combustion. Roads in and around the Lodhi Road area like other parts of Lutyens? Delhi see a huge flow of vehicles. This might be the reason behind the prevalence of this finer particulate matter. It also depends on where the station is located, the dispersion capacity, meteorological factors, among others,?

3-year-old sexually assaulted by school staffer in Bengaluru,"In yet another shocker from the city, a three-and-a-half-year old girl was sexually assaulted in her nursery school located in Bellandur by the supervisor who was later arrested. The incident came to light on Friday when the girl upon returning from school complained about pain in her private part and after some questioning by her parents, she told them that, 'Manju Bhaiya,' who works in her school had put his finger in there.The parents immediately rushed to the school and confronted principal Dr. Veena who initially denied the possibility of such an incident taking place. However, the little girl identified the man and said that the incident has happened 5-6 times.The parents then took their little one to the nearby Sakra hospital for a thorough check up. It was the hospital authorities who asked the parents to register an FIR without waiting for the school to do so. The father of the victim tells us that initially Dr. Veena was willing to register an FIR but later on only said the school would provide support and nothing more. He told India Today that she was adamant that the incident did not take place and hence would not register an FIR against the supervisor who has worked for more than 8 years in the school.On Friday evening while at the hospital itself, the parents with the help of the security staff at the Sakra hospital filed a complaint with the police. The father of the victim said that the constables came to the hospital and began to take down the complaint. But when they heard what he had to say, they immediately stopped writing and asked him to come with them to the police station. Later on in the evening, the police along with the victim's father went to the nursery school and demanded the supervisor address. He was immediately arrested and booked under the very stringent POCSO Act.On Monday as word spread, many more parents reached the school and demanded strict action against the principal. Some have alleged that their children as well have been touched inappropriately by the same school supervisor. 'My kid's thigh was touched when she would go to the washroom by the accused in spite of an aaya being present,' is what one parent told India Today. Others came out with more damning experiences their kids recounted to them.Such being the case, they wanted a case of criminal negligence be filed against the principal. But with the school authorities resorting to delaying tactics, they began to protest in the school premises till the police arrived on the spot and brought the situation under control. The principal was finally detained by the police and that was when she changed track saying she was always with the parents.Major Aditi (Retd), a child and human rights activist in the city assisted the parents in making sure that the police stopped wasting time. Speaking to India Today Aditi said, ""I want to know whether the principal was competent enough to run the school in the first place and why the most basic measures were not being followed. We have spoken about measures to be put in place so why was the little girl not escorted by an aaya to the washroom, what was the male supervisor doing there.""As of now, the school has been shut until further notice and the parents want a full-fledged investigation to take place.WATCH: Another Bengaluru horror: Woman groped, molested by bike-borne men in dark alley",general,3378,60,70
Dec 24 most polluted day of the month in Delhi so far,"Saturday turned out to be the most polluted day of December this year. Christmas day is predicted to get worse with the air quality is likely to remain in the ?severe? zone like it was on Saturday. The level of particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5micrometer (PM2.5) touched the 500-mark?the highest recordable?in the national capital, according to the Ministry of Earth Science?s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). The levels of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometer) also remained high.In Dhirpur, Delhi University, Pitampura, Terminal-3, and Mathura road, the PM levels were recorded at 500 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3). In other stations such as Lodi Road, the levels remained above 450.The minimum safe level of PM2.5 set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is 60ug/m3 and for PM10 the standard is 100ug/m3. Read: Let?s fight pollution: Choked in a dusty DelhiAccording to real-time pollution data recorded by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Anand Vihar recorded the highest level at 899ug/m3 around 2pm.Gufran Beig from SAFAR said that after a week of relatively good air quality days, compared to the last three years, there was a spike on Friday mainly because of a sudden fall in the wind speed.?The wind speed recorded on Wednesday was 16kmph and on Saturday it fell to 1kmph. This was made worse by a dip in the minimum temperature, which fell from 11 degree Celsius to 8 degree Celsius,? Beig said.He explained that such a dip in the air quality was because of the polluted air carried by winds from the Indo-Gangetic Plains. This is likely to continue in the coming days and is expected to bring smog back to the city.The forecast says the average pollution level is likely to get worse on Sunday. From Monday, the situation may improve.Despite high pollution levels, Delhi is yet to put in place a comprehensive response mechanism. The graded response system, proposed by the CPCB, is yet to be notified or enforced. The proposed plan had suggested that when the air quality remains in the ?severe? level for 48 hours, entry of trucks, barring those carrying essential commodities, will be stopped from entering the city and the odd-even road rationing scheme will kick in.Read: Pollution beats Delhi?s champs: Sportsmen, fitness freaks at greater riskThe proposal says there should be a complete ban on the burning of waste, brink kilns operating in and around the city will be shut and parking rates will be hiked by at least four times.On December 16, China declared the first ?red alert? of this season in Beijing, where schools were shut and thousands of vehicles were pulled out of roads. Residents were advised to stay indoors.?Here, if the pollution levels spike like that on Saturday, we all are clueless on what should be done. We need a plan for such days. Opening your eyes only when the situation gets really bad will not solve anything,? said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).",general,3049,53,70

Undoubtedly the second game was crucial. But Amalraj had another chance coming his way in the fourth which, like the second, he could have turned to his advantage.Trailing 8-9 in the fourth, Amalraj opted for time-out and even managed to win the next point to level the score only to let the opportunity slip by.

Amalraj secured the next two. Soon confusion prevailed and Ghosh, who was awarded the next point, advised the umpire that the ball had hit his shirt.With the score at 4-3 in favour of Soumyajit, a determined Amalraj attacked well to recover and level 7-all. But that was all he could do as the next four points went Ghosh's way and with that the title was secured.""I had to start the sixth game aggressively because I kept thinking about my first big international title. It was hard to win against Amalraj. It took some time to adapt to the ball, harder than the one we used before enabling more power but less spin,"" said Soumyajit in a release.""Now I'm the third to win such a tournament.

"Delhi cabbie who returned bag worth ?8 lakh has ?70,000 loan","The foreign currency notes and valuables in the black backpack worth Rs 8 lakh, forgotten by its owner in his taxi, could have taken care of everything Debendra Kapri has ever wished for. The 22-year-old taxi driver returned it to its owner and bought contentment instead. His conscience and his father?s lessons on honesty figure higher on the list than his needs, he says. Last week, Kapri walked into a police station at Delhi?s domestic airport to deposit a bag left behind in his vehicle by a passenger earlier that day. The officer on duty was shocked to find that it contained gold jewellery, a laptop, an iPhone, a camera and $70 ? items amounting to a whopping Rs 8 lakh.Kapri claimed that he knew what was there inside the bag but decided to return it to its owner. The police later found out that the bag belonged to Mubisher Wani, a resident of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. He was given back the bag that same evening.Kapri is a debt-ridden man and is struggling to repay a loan of Rs 70,000 to a private financier in his home town in Bihar?s Banka. His father took a loan of Rs 1 lakh in 2008-09 on a 5% per month interest rate to marry off two of his daughters. The simple farmer, who did not have a permanent source of income, could not even pay the monthly interest amount. The interest amount accumulated with every passing month and the pressure to return the money intensified, initially with warnings and later with life threats to the family members. With the added compound interest, the Rs 1 lakh loan increased to Rs 2 lakh within 2 years.The family sold a small piece of their land but it was not enough to pay off the loan. In 2011, Kapri?s elder brother left home for Rajkot in Gujarat to earn a livelihood. But his meagre income proved insufficient to cater to his personal expenses and needs of his family of 5, leave alone repaying the loan.?My father was under stress and mother fell sick but we had no money to buy medicines for her. With each passing day, our financial condition was deteriorating. Though I was only 17, I had no choice but to quit my studies and support my family in the crisis. In 2012, I came to Delhi in search of a job,? Kapri says.The youngest among four siblings, Kapri recalls he could appear only in 2 subjects in his Class 10 examination because he met with an accident. ?That accident changed my life. Family?s responsibility took over my books and dreams of becoming an engineer. Destiny brought me to the streets of the national capital and I ended up becoming a cleaner at a taxi stand at Delhi airport,? he says. Before completing two years, Kapri had learnt how to drive a car. His cousin, Pintu, took up the role of his driving instructor in addition to being his only guardian in the city. Kapri now aspires to own one for a better life. Kapri lives in a 10x10 rented room with his two roommates, who too work as drivers, on the first floor of a building in Mehram Nagar, an urban village near the Delhi airport. An iron door opens into the room that has an open kitchen with a gas stove and cylinder on the floor. The front wall has 2 cloth hangers that struggle to lift the weight of the clothes of the 3 occupants. On the left side is a small mirror which the room partners share. ?The fan in my room blows out hot air and makes it difficult for us to fight the scorching heat and sleep. But the kind of appreciation I have received from my friends, neighbours from my home town and here in Delhi after the incident gives me peace of mind. I stuck to the lessons of my father and feel satisfied. My moral values are greater than my personal needs,? Kapri said. Asked what he would do if he has Rs 8 lakh of his own, Kapri says, ?I will first repay the loan. From the remaining amount, I will purchase my own taxi that will certainly improve my lifestyle.?",general,3828,60,70

Kohli let emotions affect his batting against Aus: Ganguly,"Virat Kohli's batting was affected by his emotional outbursts in the acrimonious Test series against Australia, feels former captain Sourav Ganguly, who is hoping that the Indian skipper ""cools down"" to score big again.Ganguly observed that Kohli's desire to win at any cost as a captain led to his outbursts. (Kohli's friendship comment made in heat of moment: Warne)""Against Australia, probably he (Kohli) was so consumed by wanting to win as captain that he let his emotions affect his batting. This will also serve as a lesson for Virat. He's such a precocious talent, I hope he cools down and gets back to scoring big again,"" Ganguly wrote in a for the 'ICC' website.India got the better of Australia 2-1 at home in one of the most intense and bitterly-fought series in recent years. The contest was marred by one controversy after another with the two captains -- Kohli and Steve Smith -- continuously being in the eye of a storm.Kohli was in sublime form before this series, becoming the only man to slam double hundreds in four consecutive series. The 28-year-old amassed 1457 runs in 13 matches this season. But he had a horrendous outing with the bat in the series against Tests against Australia, totalling just 46 runs in five innings with scores of 0, 13, 12, 15 and 6 in three games. He had to sit out of the fourth and final Test because of a shoulder injury. Ganguly, regarded as one of India's most successful captains, rated Kohli as among of the finest in the world while describing him as a passionate skipper.""There are two Virats for me. The batsman and the captain. (Kohli has ensured India will never back down: Clarke to India Today)""The batsman surely is one of the best in the world because he has set high standards for himself, both in terms of fitness and the hunger to score big. The captain is more passionate and more of a leader than anything else,"" Ganguly wrote.""He wants to win and win every day and while it may not be possible always, I see Virat not settling for anything that isn't No.1.""GANGULY PRAISES PUJARAThe former India skipper also shared his delight at watching KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav gain in confidence and match Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin. He tipped Cheteshwar Pujara as the batsman who will be most critical to India's successes abroad.""More than the results, I enjoyed the journey, watching how players like KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav gained in confidence and matched the two champions, Virat and Ravichandran Ashwin,"" Ganguly wrote. (Sachin Tendulkar calls Cheteshwar Pujara 'silent warrior')""But the one who stood out was Cheteshwar Pujara. I remember when he was dropped for a Test in West Indies last year, I had said Pujara was a special batsman and shouldn't have been dropped. A small matter of 1,316 runs have come from his bat this season and Pujara will be the most critical for Virat when India start travelling outside of the sub-continent.""'POTENTIAL TO WIN ANYWHERE'Ganguly said the current Indian team has the potential to win anywhere in the world.""And having watched the last 13 home Tests, I hope Virat and his team really has the potential to win anywhere - in or outside India,"" he said.Talking about the Dharamsala Test, which according to him was the highlight of the season, Ganguly wrote: ""I was sitting at home around lunchtime on Day Three when Australia began its second innings. (Virat Kohli needs to take short break from cricket: Brad Haddin )""Over the next hour or so, I watched such a great piece of fast and hostile bowling by the two Indians, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The way they got the Australians hopping and succumbing to the pace, I am so pleased for Virat.""The most memorable win came in conditions actually tailor-made for the Australians more than the Indians. The fact that India beat the Aussies at their own game will surely give another twist to Virat's captaincy.""'KUMBLE'S ROLE'Ganguly also said chief coach Anil Kumble played a big role in India's success in the home season.""When the BCCI appointed a three-member panel that had Tendulkar, Laxman and me to help in the process of selecting a coach, Anil's vision was as decisive as his bowling used to be.

Republican Party of India to seek ?636-cr loan waiver for SCs,"The Republican Party of India (RPI) led by union minister Ramdas Athawale would start an agitation from July 25, demanding a loan waiver of Rs636 crore, which had been advanced by state-run corporations to people from Scheduled Class and Tribes for self-employment and other reasons.According to a source, RPI party workers will agitate across the state in front of collectors? offices demanding the waiver. According to Athawale, like farmers, even people from socially backward classes are facing hardships. ?These people are in no position to pay and hence the loans should be waived off. If the farmers can get relief, even these people who have taken loans should be let off,? said Athawale. He said he would talk to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on this issue. Various state-run corporations like Annabhau Sathe Mahamandal and Mahatma Phule backward Class Development Corporation provide loans to the people belonging to the backward classes and tribes to start their own ventures at subsidised interest rates. However, the number of defaulters seem to be on the rise. Last month, farmers across the state started their strike, which resulted in a massive shortage of vegetable and fruits as well as rates reaching record highs. This forced Fadnavis to accept their demands and he announced a mega loan waiver of Rs34,000 crore. Political analysts called such demands as just vote-gathering tactics. ?The Fadnavis Government has opened a Pandoras box and now many disadvantageous sections will demand similar concessions,? said political analyst Prakash Bal. ?Athawale is just playing to the gallery as these people are his voters, but the Government is unlikely to cede to his demand,? he added.",general,1707,61,70

This time, the National Award-winning filmmaker delves into the murky world of Delhi and the unconventional relationships that take wing in the shadow of the city?s high-class lifestyle, with Shab. With his brilliant understanding of human emotions, Onir takes a leap into the ?forbidden? love stories of the society with his latest venture.Shab traces the lives of four characters - their personal struggles and love lives. Mohan (Ashish Bisht) is a small-towner who travels from Dhanaulti to Delhi with the hope of becoming a successful model. He is rejected at a talent hunt after being mocked for his ?lack of finnese? and is ridiculed for his broken English. One of the judges, however, finds her fantasy in this young man and there starts our first love story. She is Sonal Modi (Raveena Tandon), a rich trophy wife whose husband has no interest in her life. She decides to make Mohan her boy-toy. Meanwhile, Mohan meets Raina (Arpita Chatterjee) and Neel (Areesz Gandii) who appear to be caring, helpful and hard-working people and offer him all the help he needs. While Neel is recovering from a broken relationship, Raina appears to be mostly concerned about her younger sister?s well-being even as she nurtures some darker secrets. Onir?s expertise is seen in the way he handles these characters and their stories - his sensible filmmaking is written all over the frames. Even when showing stereotypical mindsets in our society, he makes it a point to balance out the narrow-minded comments by placing sane-minded characters nearby, giving them at least one or two jibes to throw at the prejudiced characters. Shab is the darkest film Onir has made till date. With the film, he explores the ?morally wrong? shades of human relationship without letting the audience hold any judgments - he shows us the emotional turmoils of people in these relationships. Though the reason behind such endeavours is revealed much later in the film, what we get to witness, are the everyday struggles. Of the four main characters, Onir seems to give a bigger window into the hearts of Mohan and Sonal. Raveena Tandon has given one of her most sensual, brilliant performances in Shab. She manages to bring out every single element of a rich and lonely trophy wife who does not shy away from paying up for the love she desires. She is authoritative, demanding and dominant when Mohan but becomes a loyal, caring wife when sitting beside her husband (Sanjay Suri) in a party. Her last scene, where she is told that her credit card is blocked, is something you will appreciate the most. When asked to pay up later at a hotel, she takes off her jewelry, places them at the counter and tells the man behind the cash counter, ?Tell my husband that her wife has kept all this for guarantee?. And the masterstroke comes when she places her heels at the counter as well. Ashish has an air of innocence about his presence that adds to the credibility of his character and makes his efforts shine through. Shab is a dark, haunting film about human emotions, relationships, love and betrayal that thrive in a rather opportunistic and materialistic world of Delhi?s elite society.

Complaint against Diljit Dosanjh for glorifying dog fights,"Popular Punjabi singers Diljit Dosanjh and Kamal Grewal may find themselves in trouble for 'glorifying dog fights' in their latest album videos and songs.Animal rights activists have set up a page on Facebook called 'Exposing Animal Fights in India', whereby they have uploaded more than 100 secretly-captured videos of the 'canine blood sport.'This sport is hugely popular in parts of Punjab and Haryana such as Bhatinda, Ludhiana, Hisar, Fatehabad, Gurgaon and held clandestinely in several farmhouses in Delhi. Breeds such as pittbulls, bull dogs, Indian mastiffs and other pedigree dogs are especially bred and trained to be ferocious to the point of being lethal and kill other dogs in wrestling-kind of rings.Alongside, the dog lovers have also uploaded a song each of Diljit Dosanjh called 'Pitbull' and Kamal Grewal's 'Sarkari Ban' where both seem to be promoting the illegal activity.While Dosanjh, who is himself seen handling pitbulls in the video, says, ""Rakhe fight nu vi Pitbull chaar ni"" (Have kept four pitbulls for fighting), Grewal in his song called 'Sarkari Ban' says, ""Petbull'an da chalaya yaaran ne hai daur ni"" (Friends have begun the trend of pitbull fighting)."" He is also seen making two unruly dogs fight with mouth guards on.Grewal also seems to praise sports like bull racing and pigeon fights (kabutarbaazi), which also comes under the Gambling Act other than Prevention of Animal Cruelty Act and IPC Section 429 for killing and maiming animals.COMPLAINTS FILEDAbhinav Srihan of NGO Fauna Police says, ""We strongly condemn this. It is wrong to project dog fights as something macho, valiant or courageous. Punjab has historically been known for healthy human sports like kushti and kabaddi. The Sikh Regiment in Indian Army has won maximum awards for their true heroism, and our Gurus have also taught compassion for all.""""It is sad that things have come to a point where we make dogs fight and set this as an example for the youth,"" he added.Few dog lovers have already forwarded complaints to the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) regarding singers Dosanjh, Grewal and some more small-time singers also. The complainants say that some singers are not just promoting animal cruelty, but drugs consumption and use of illegal firearms through their explicit videos, as well.The AWBI has taken cognizance of these complaints and written letters to Punjab Police for action. Strangely, singer Kamal Grewal responded to one of these FB posts saying, ""How can a song, which is itself named 'Sarkari Ban' be banned by the authorities."" Diljit Dosanjh, on the other hand, did not respond to the criticism on FB despite being tagged.Earlier, Union minister for women and child welfare Maneka Gandhi had said that she was aware of this cruel sport.

Quit by 10 AM tomorrow or get fired: Tech Mahindra to worker,"Like it or not, but, the IT job market in India is seemingly crashing. In fact, it's been on the verge of a catastrophic breakdown for quite some time now, with big-ticket companies looking to both hand over pink slips to incumbent employees as well as hire less talent. Nearly 2 lakh jobs are said to be at stake. The fact that a number of these pink slips are apparently being handed over to employees on short notice catching them completely off-guard makes matters worse.In one such incidence, a Bengaluru-based Tech Mahindra employee was reportedly asked - or rather instructed - to hang his boots as part of the company's restructuring plans. He was literally instructed by an HR manager to put in his papers the next morning or else face the axe. Now on a regular day, and inside an IT company, one would expect an employee to be given a fair amount of time to look for alternatives. Only, this wasn't the case at Tech Mahindra. To further cement the unfair treatment meted out to him, the employee managed to record his conversation with the HR and then went on to upload the same on Soundcloud. ""Cost optimisation is happening at the company and your name is part of that list. If you can put in papers we will be treating it as a normal exit with June 15 as last working day, if not, we will be sending you a termination letter,"" the HR executive is heard saying in the 6:45-minute long audio clip. When the employee dares to reason, the HR is heard re-instating what is supposedly a fact at Tech Mahindra, that the company reserves all rights to let the associates go whenever it wants, with the basic salary. The same is mentioned in the offer letter that the employees are asked to sign at the time of joining.",technology,1727,60,70
Harbhajan asks Kumble for increased fees for Ranji players,"Time away from national team has given Harbhajan Singh a fresh perspective about the condition of an average domestic cricketer, prompting him to request chief national coach Anil Kumble to raise the issue of their match fees with the COA.Kumble is set to give a presentation to the Committee of Administrators (COA) on May 21 about the revised pay structure of the contracted Indian cricketers with an eye on substantial hike on current central contract. The grades are Rs 2 crore, Rs 1 crore and Rs 50 lakh.While the elite Indian cricketers are a sorted lot along with a handful of first-class players, who have IPL contracts, an average domestic cricketer still gets a match fee of Rs 1.5 lakh (first XI player) for a first-class game (Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy) compared to the Rs 15 lakh for a Test match.One of India's finest spinners, Harbhajan has recently written to Kumble about the financial insecurities of domestic cricketers.The letter, accessed by PTI, has Harbhajan making an emotional plea to Kumble.""It's been last 2/3 years (that) I am playing Ranji Trophy. I hate that I've found constant struggle around me in the financial situation of my first-class teammates. Even though Ranji Trophy is hosted by the richest cricket board in the world, I appeal to you as a player, who is an inspiration and role model for all Ranji players,"" Harbhajan wrote to Kumble.""I request you to please take this up with the top brass of BCCI and players like Sachin, Rahul, Laxman, Viru to ensure that a change is brought about in the pay structure, in the amounts they get paid,"" Harbhajan wrote.Harbhajan finds it difficult to digest that the Ranji pay structure has not undergone revision for a long time.""I am willing to help/assist in any way to help bring in a change. It's shocking to say the least that the payment system hasn't been changed since 2004. Imagine the value of 100 rupees then and now. It is so different.""India's third highest wicket-taker in Tests felt that an average domestic cricketer can't plan his life and investments.""Imagine in today's day and age how can you call yourself a professional if your 'job' doesn't even tell you how much you will earn yearly? How can you sign up and commit your life to a job which doesn't promise you a fixed income every year. And that too, you are paid one year after you complete your work.""The guys can't even plan their future because they don't know whether they would earn Rs 1 lakh or Rs 10 lakh in that year and it leads to huge issues in their lives and families and (affects) state of mind. Anyway, let's try and gently make a change for our brothers,"" he concluded the letter.When asked about the letter, Harbhajan told PTI: ""If I wouldn't have played domestic cricket during last four-five years, I wouldn't have known what an average domestic cricketer goes through. Not everyone has a job. By God's grace, if they get an IPL contract their lives improve.",sports,2938,58,70

Farmers do shavasana on highway on Int'l Yoga Day in protest,"While PM Narendra Modi led the country in celebrating the International Yoga Day, farmers in a few states protested by performing shavasana (corpse pose) to highlight the agrarian crisis.In Madhya Pradesh, farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh headed by Shivkumar Sharma demonstrated their protest by performing the 'shavasana', since their demands for loan waiver and better prices for the agriculture produce are still not met.

"IT staff taken care of, no need for union: Ex-Infosys CFO","Hyderabad, May 30 (PTI) Employees unions are not needed in information technology industry where work ethic is good and the staff are well-paid with techies even finding opportunities outside the company they work for, says a senior industry figure. Whenever there is a downturn, there is always noise about unions coming into play in the IT industry but it never sustained, ex-Chief Financial Officer of Infosys Ltd, V Balakrishnan told PTI. ""Work ethic is very good and salaries are high. Even today the attrition rate in the IT industry is double digit. It (talk of employees unions) always fizzles out after some point of time. It never sustained,"" he told PTI. ""But I think even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because IT industry is one of the best paymasters in the country and second, the people find opportunities outside"", he said. The employees unions work in industries where work ethic is bad and where employees are treated shabbily. Following reports of layoffs and fears about further retrenchment in the slow-down hit IT industry, there had been some talk in recent times about forming a union. ""IT industry is not bad, IT industry people are well taken care of, well-paid, and they find opportunities. Even one of the bad years, this year, where growth rate has come down, the attrition is still double digit. ""So, I dont find a need for union in this industry. Even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because people are well taken care of in this industry,"" said the former Board member of Infosys. Balakrishnan said the reports about widespread job losses in IT industry are exaggerated. ""If you look at all the leading companies, none of them are talking about huge job losses; they are all talking about the regular performance-based attrition, that is normal in the industry. So, to some extent the scare of job losses is exaggerated,"" he said. He said IT is not a traditional industry. ""Its a global industry where you get global opportunities to work. This industry is different, its not like traditional industry. I dont know whether formal union kind of structure will succeed."" On if boom times are over for the Indian IT industry, Balakrishnan said: ""Thats what we had been told when 2000 dotcom happened...Y2K came up...2008 financial crisis.

Ban Diwali crackers before ending Jallikattu: Tamil director,"National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran on Monday came out in support of jallikattu saying that before asking for a ban on the traditional and ancient bull-taming sport, people should think about banning crackers on Diwali and immersing Lord Ganesh idols in water during Ganesh Chaturthi which disturbs the eco-system.""The main reason why PETA and others want to put a ban on this traditional practice (jallikattu) is that they say it's cruelty to animals,"" said Vetrimaaran. Vetrimaaran was in the capital on Monday for an event.""If this is the priority to stop this practice, then I think they are misinformed; as every year, because of India's biggest festival, not just one breed called bulls, but every living creature is killed and lost... and that's Diwali. If they are really concerned about the welfare of animals, then they should ban crackers. If they are really concerned about the eco-system, then they should know that every year so much of toxic material is dumped into the sea during Ganesh Chaturthi, so they should stop that,"" he added.ALSO READ: Kamal Haasan asks Tamils not to hurt Trisha over jallikattu ALSO READ: After Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth backs jallikattuVetrimaaran went on to add that people are ""just responding to what they see on some video clips, where someone is torturing the bulls"".""If that happens, then that needs to be stopped, I don't deny that.

Noise pollution threatens protected wildlife areas: Study,"Washington, May 7 (PTI) Noise pollution caused by humans is pervasive in the US protected areas, posing a threat to land masses that harbour wildlife and provide places for respite, recreation, and natural resource conservation. Protected areas in the US represent about 14 per cent of the land mass. Researchers, including those from Colorado State University in the US, analysed millions of hours of sound measurements from 492 sites around continental US. The results summarised predictions of existing sound levels, estimates of natural sound levels, and the amount that human-made noise raises levels above natural levels, which is considered noise pollution. Researchers found that human-made noise doubled background sound levels in 63 per cent of US protected areas, and caused a ten-fold or greater increase in background levels in 21 per cent of protected areas. In other words, noise reduced the area that natural sounds can be heard by 50 to 90 per cent. This also means that what could be heard at 100 feet away could only be heard from 10 to 50 feet, researchers said. This reduced capacity to hear natural sound reduces the restorative properties of spending time in nature, such as mood enhancement and stress reduction, interfering with the enjoyment typically experienced by park visitors. ""The noise levels we found can be harmful to visitor experiences in these areas, and can be harmful to human health, and to wildlife,"" said Rachel Buxton, from Warner College of Natural Resources in the US. ""We were encouraged to see that many large wilderness areas have sound levels that are close to natural levels. Protecting these important natural acoustic resources as development and land conversion progresses is critical if we want to preserve the character of protected areas,"" she said. High levels of noise pollution were also found in critical habitat for endangered species, namely in endangered plant and insect habitats. ""Although plants can not hear, many animals that disperse seeds or pollinate flowers can hear and are known to be affected by noise, resulting in indirect impacts on plants,"" said Buxton.",general,2134,57,70
Disclose Godse's statement in Gandhi murder trial: CIC,"New Delhi, Feb 17 (PTI) The statement of Nathuram Godse, along with other relevant records related to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, should be ""proactively disclosed"" on the website of the National Archives, the CIC has ruled. Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said, ""One may disagree with Nathuram Godse and his co-accused but we cannot refuse disclosure or circulation of his opinion. ""At the same time, neither Nathuram Godse nor the holder of his theme or opinion can go to the extent of killing a person whose philosophy he cannot agree with,"" he said in his order. Godse, a right-wing activist, had assassinated the Mahatma on January 30, 1948. Petitioner Ashutosh Bansal had demanded the charge sheet and Godses statement, among other details, from Delhi Police which forwarded the application to the National Archives of India (NAI), saying the records have been handed over to it. The National Archives asked Bansal to inspect the records and cull out the information. After failure to get the information, Bansal approached the Central Information Commissioner (CIC). Acharyulu directed the Central Public Information Commissioner (CPIO-NAI) not to charge Rs three per page for photocopying because the Right to Information Act overrides any such provision of the Public Records Act by virtue of Section 22 of the RTI Act. Although neither Delhi Police nor the National Archives cited any objection on the disclosure of the information, Acharyulu said that the information sought does not attract any of the exemption clauses. He said since the information is more than 20-years-old, it cannot be withheld unless it attracts section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act which prohibits disclosure of information that prejudicially affects security of the State or relations with foreign countries. Acharyulu said in the present case, even section 8(1)(a) does not apply as the argument that disclosure of Godses statement could lead to enmity between Hindu and Muslim communities would not apply.",general,2008,54,70
National Anthem ?Jana Gana Mana? was adopted on this day,"All of us have sung the national anthem and since school, stood up every time we heard it . But do we know enough about our anthem other than that it was written and composed by Nobel laureate and mystic poet Ravindranath Tagore? Here are some interesting facts about our anthem which you probably were not aware of:1. The false myth that Jana Gana Mana was written and composed by Tagore to praise George the Fourth, who visited India in 1911.2. A hoax message spread like wild fire across e-mail, Whatsapp and social media, that UNESCO announced our anthem as the 'Best National Anthem' in the world. UNESCO intervened and denied any such declaration from their end. 3. The first rendition of the song was during a convention of the Indian National Congress on December 16th, 1911. 'Jana Gana Mana' was performed for the first time in Hamburg on 11th September, 1942. It was only on 24th January 1950 that this song was officially declared as India's national anthem.4. The musical notations for the English translation of our national anthem were set by Margaret, wife of poet James H. Cousins, who was the principal of Besant Theosophical College. 5. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose commissioned a free translation of the national anthem from Sanskritized Bengali to Urdu-Hindi. The translation was written by Captain Abid Ali, composed by Captain Ram Singh Thakur and was called Subah Sukh Chain.6. There is no provision of law which compels anyone to sing the national anthem. It is not considered disrespectful to the nation or to the anthem if a person chooses only to stand up in respectful silence. 7. Formal rendition of the anthem should take 52 seconds by law, and not 54 seconds.",general,1715,56,70

Only employer to decide if staff's work is satisfactory: HC,"New Delhi, Apr 13 (PTI) An employer, not a court, will decide whether a probationary employees services are satisfactory, the Delhi High Court has said. Justice Valmiki Mehta made the observation while upholding the termination of services of a teacher by a private school in the national capital. ""Whether or not a probationary employees services are satisfactory, it is for the employer to decide ..., and this court cannot substitute its view for that of the employer with respect to satisfactory services or otherwise of employee with the employer,"" the court said. The school had terminated the services of a teacher in March 2014 after keeping him on probation for nearly three years as his work was not found to be satisfactory. The teacher had challenged the decision in the Delhi School Tribunal (DST) which on December 10, 2015 had ruled in his favour by ordering his reinstatement. The school had challenged the DSTs decision in the high court which set aside the tribunals order, holding the termination of his service as valid. It said that since the man, who was appointed on April 4, 2011, did not complete three years of service in the school, he would not be entitled to be confirmed as an employee as was ruled by the Delhi High Court in another matter in 2013. While setting aside the tribunals decision, the high court also expressed surprise as to how the DST avoided direct reference to the 2013 decision of the high court. In its decision of 2013 in another service matter, the high court had held that the maximum period of probation can be three years, six years in gravest of grave cases, and there can be deemed confirmation of services only after that. The teacher was on probation from April 4, 2011 to March 5, 2014 when his services were terminated. He had contended that as per the terms and conditions of his service, the probationary period was not to exceed two years, but he was kept on probation for longer than that.",general,1955,59,70
Chant mantra against China before prayers: RSS,"The RSS wants to ward off the ""asura"", or demon, of China with a new ""mantra"". While the Sangh has advocated a policy of economic assault on Beijing by encouraging Indians to shun the use of Chinese goods and materials in daily lives, even in the process of praying, it has come up with a mantra to be chanted five times before prayers, be it a Hindu household's daily offerings to God or a Muslim's namaz.Even as the rejection of Chinese manufactures used in such daily affairs as household worshipping rituals is meant to attack the ubiquitous presence of China-made goods, thereby denying the neighbour one of the largest consumer markets in the world, it also aims to educate Indians in things they use without knowing them to be of Chinese origin. RSS has maintained that while war is undesirable, if push comes to shove, the country is ready and has, therefore, come out to support the hard stance assumed by India on the tri-junction (India-Bhutan-China) confrontation in the Doklam plateau.""Kailash, Himalaya aur Tibet Cheen ki asuri shakti se mukt ho"" (Kailash, Himalaya and Tibet be delivered from the demonic clutches of China). This is the mantra or 'sankalp', translated into 'resolve', that the RSS wants every Indian to chant five times before starting their prayers.""This will not just hurt the core interest of China, but also infuse spiritual energy in the efforts and will create positive action,"" senior RSS pracharak and national executive member Indresh Kumar told Mail Today.""China has adopted a fundamentally imperialist and expansionist character. It has moved away from Confucianism and has become a votary of violence. The recent entanglement with India has brought India several friends and China has lost many. They have shown that they are neither with India nor the world; rather want to continue the politics of violence. They have captured the territory of several countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, apart from having captured Tibet. Doklam was saved from their clutches only as Indian and Bhutanese soldiers pre-empted Chinese design,"" he added.Kumar believes that China has already been cornered in its recent misadventure among the comity of nations, but the best way to attack the Chinese is to encourage every Indian to resolve to use only Swadeshi or India-made goods and reject Chinese manufactures of all kinds.CHINA A DANGER?""The people of India have come to realise the impending danger that China poses. At a meet in Agra in UP a few days ago, it was decided that no one in India, from any caste, creed or religion should use Chinese goods in daily prayers. Due to invasion of Chinese materials in India, almost three crore Indians and Nepalese nationals have lost livelihood. People of India must also resolve to boycott Chinese goods during the celebration of their chief festivals such as Rakhi, Diwali, Eid or Guru Parv etc. We are capable of breaking China's back not only by confrontation, but by following the non-violent path charted by Lord Buddha,"" Kumar said. Kumar said the hitherto supporters of China too have now started looking at it with suspicion.""China has for long blessed Pakistan with resources and material which have been used to destabilise India through terrorism. ""Now, Pakistan included, all nations who have so far colluded with China, fear that the imperialist nation might be using them to counteract India, but might annex them partially or completely in the process,"" he added.He went on: ""We support the non-compromising attitude of the Indian government towards the Indo-China standoff in Doklam and even otherwise. The diplomacy of India and the tough stand it has taken have baffled and disturbed China which is evident in the chiding remarks that they are giving in the media. Chinese disrespect for human rights and democracy have exposed it in front of the world. The world now has come to recognise it to be inhuman, undemocratic and given to violent means.""",general,3948,46,70

Priyanka's Hollywood debut film Baywatch hits the theatres,"Director: Seth Gordon Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka ChopraRating: (2.5/5)Baywatch, the TV series, is best remembered not for its great content, but for Pamela Anderson's jiggling jugs as she runs on the beach in slo-mo wearing her iconic red swimsuit. In Baywatch, the film, too, the female lifeguards have little to do other than pander to the male gaze. Ladies, worry not, there are enough shots of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Zac Efron's abs to keep you distracted from the lack of a solid plot.Dwayne plays Mitch Buchanon (originally played by David Hasselhoff), the leader of the lifeguard squad consisting of Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera), CJ (Kelly Rohrbach, stepping into Pamela Anderson's shoes), Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Matt Brody (Zac Efron) and Ron (Jon Bass). For Mitch, being a lifeguard is not just about getting a tan and occasionally saving people from drowning, but about ""saving the bay.""They get their opportunity when the Huntley Club gets a new owner, Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), and things start going awry. Drugs and dead bodies start showing up on the beach, and the lifeguards are convinced that Victoria is somehow involved.The characters in Baywatch are largely unidimensional - Mitch is tough but emotional, the female lifeguards are mainly eye-candy and Matt is the stereotype of the cocky buff dude. Zac's Matt, the washed out Olympic gold medallist, almost gets some depth, but then the writers change their mind. One minute, he talks about his rough childhood spent in various foster homes, the next minute, he is back to being the thick-as-a-brick butt of jokes.Priyanka plays an alter ego of her Dil Dhadakne Do character in Baywatch - a girl who loses the family business to her brother, despite having the acumen, so she decides to come to the ""land of opportunity"" and rise to the top, by hook or by crook. She is convincing as the ruthless Victoria, but in terms of screen time, it feels like an extended cameo. Perhaps, some of the fault lies with the Indian Censor Board. Her ""Easy, Britney"" portion (from the trailer), for instance, is not in the final cut.Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are as good as they can be in a film with a wafer-thin plot. Dwayne's deadpan delivery of a different emasculating insult directed at Zac's character every time (""One Direction,"" ""High School Musical,"" ""Bieber""...you get the gist) evokes some laughter. Jon Bass has his hilarious moments - when he sings Katy Perry's Roar in the shower and when he owns the dance floor.Baywatch, the film, has been remodelled as a comedy with far too many penis jokes, most of which are flaccid (pun intended). What does impress, however, is the cinematography. Visually, Baywatch looks great, with beautiful shots of the lifeguards diving into the crystalline water.David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson have somewhat confusing cameos just for the sake of it; they play the same characters as they did in the original. So Mitch 1 shares screen space with Mitch 2...you get it.If you're looking for a no-brainer with lots of eye-candy and low-intellect jokes, Baywatch makes for a decent one-time watch.",entertainment,3137,58,70
"Who is Kulbhushan Jadhav, Indian sentenced to death in Pak?","Addressing Kulbhushan Jadhav as an Indian RAW agent, Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released a statement saying Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, who was living as Hussein Mubarak Patel, was arrested on March 3 last year through a ""Counter Intelligence Operation"" from Balochistan's Mashkel. The arrest was for his alleged involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.The statement also said that Kulbhushan Jadhav ""the spy"" has been tried through Field General Court Martial (FCGM) and was sentenced to death today.WHO IS KULBHUSHAN JADHAV? Kulbhushan Jadhav is an Indian citizen, recognised by the Indian government as a former naval officer, and was arrested by Pakistan alleging espionage. Pakistan claims Kulbhushan Jadhav, sometimes spelled Kulbhushan Yadav, was arrested near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border of Chaman in Balochistan over illegal entry into the country. India, however, claims that Kulbhushan Jadhav was abducted by Pakistan from Iran. Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested by the Pakistani forces on March 3, 2016, and was accused of being an undercover agent of India's primary intelligence agency -- the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) -- and of being involved in propagating sectarian violence in Balochistan. Balochistan Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti accused Kulbhushan Jadhav of helping terrorists financially and alleged his involvement in Karachi unrest. Jadhav is said to have been arrested after he was caught speaking in Marathi to his family over a mobile phone. KULBHUSHAN JADHAV'S BACKGROUND Kulbhushan Jadhav joined the Indian National Defence Academy in the year 1987. He joined the Indian Navy in the year 1991. In a video ""evidence"" Pakistan produced to prove that Kulbhushan confessed he is indeed a RAW agent, he could be heard saying he served in the Indian Navy till the 2001 Parliament attack happened.After the Parliament attack of 2001, Kulbhushan Jadhav went undercover as Hussain Mubarak Patel to gather information and intelligence within India. Jadhav, who took permanent retirement from the Indian Navy, became a businessman and travelled across the world. Kulbhushan's family members told The Indian Express last year that he carried necessary documents whenever he travelled and that they suspect he was ""framed as part of a larger political conspiracy"". Kulbhushan Jadhav, a resident of Mumbai's Hiranandani Gardens, belongs to a family of police officers. Kulbhushan's father Sudhir Jadhav retired as an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Mumbai around nine years ago and his uncle Subhash Jadhav was in charge of Bandra police station in 2002, said The Indian Express report. A report in the DNA said that Kulbhushan set up a business of operating ferries from the Iranian port town of Bandar Abbas. Jadhav is married and has two children.KULBHUSHAN JADHAV'S CONFESSION Pakistan produced a ""video confession"" in which Kulbhushan Jadhav could be seen narrating that he was a serving Indian Naval officer and that he was undercover in Pakistan as part of his work with RAW. He could also be seen accepting that he launched an operation to destabilise Pakistan from the Iranian port of Chabahar and that RAW had been funding the sectarians in Balochistan.Here is the video Pakistan produced: DOCTORED VIDEO India Today had accessed intelligence reports that indicate that the video of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the so-called Indian spy, is a doctored one. Also, intelligence agencies suspect that a group named Jaishul Adil that owes its allegiance to the Al-Qaeda is responsible for kidnapping the Indian businessman.|| Also read : 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil"" ||INDIAN GOVERNMENT'S STANCE",general,3723,59,70

Pak-born London terrorist was trying for a job at Wimbledon,"security firm: report London, Jun 11 (PTI) Pakistan-born British citizen Khuram Butt, the London Bridge attack ringleader, had been trying to get a job with a security firm that provides stewards for Wimbledon and other sporting events, raising concerns whether he had considered targeting the prestigious tennis tournament. Security services and counter-terrorism police are now investigating 27-year-old Butts motive in trying to get the job with the security company, the Telegraph reported today. Citing well-placed sources, the paper said that Butt had set up the job interview with the security firm that supplies safety stewards to Wimbledon and to Premier League football clubs. The interview was scheduled to take place at the end of this month. ""One possibility is Butt had considered targeting the tennis tournament but decided to speed up the plot, following the Manchester Arena bombing, and switched the attack to London Bridge,"" the paper said. Butt had previously worked for six months on the London Underground until quitting in October. Although he was under low­level investigation by MI5 and counter­terrorism police, Butt was able to get a job working at Westminster station because employers are not made aware of security services concerns when performing criminal records checks, the paper said. ""The security firm would check his background but it does not have access to the police watch list or have knowledge of any MI5 investigation. There would have been no reason for him not to get the job. Butt could not only have caused serious damage but potentially helped other terrorists to get into one of these events,"" the paper said, quoting a source close to the intelligence services.

"Trump's going to fail and Theresa May won't last, says Soros","Theresa May will not remain in power long as Brexit cripples her government, while Donald Trump is a ?would-be dictator? who is ?going to fail?, the billionaire investor George Soros has told the Davos world economic forum.On the eve of Trump?s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the ?impostor and con-man? was ?gearing up for a trade war? which would have ?a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world?.The ?would-be-dictator ? didn?t expect to win, he was surprised?, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held.?I personally have confidence that he?s going to fail ? because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,? added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump?s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign.Soros said he expected financial markets to ?not do very well? because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration.On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union ? and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled.?In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,? he said.?At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards.?This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they?ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won?t rise as fast as the cost of living.?The divorce is going to take a very long time. It?s much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.?Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce.The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016. Europe had become too complicated, leaving people alienated and anti-European parties gathering force.May, speaking earlier at the forum, said Britain had voted with ?determination and quiet resolve? to leave the EU but it was ?overwhelmingly? in Britain?s interests for Europe to succeed.?Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world.

Maharashtra govt to waive loans of 10 lakh more farmers,"Widening the scope of the farm loan waiver, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said that the package would benefit about 10 lakh more farmers whose loans banks had restructured. Now, the loans of up to 46 lakh farmers will be waived. This will also put an additional burden of up to Rs8,000 crore on the exchequer.After days of protests last month, the government announced a loan waiver of Rs34,022 crore. A major chunk of the farmers whose outstanding loans were restructured in 2014-15 and 2015-16 owing to drought were left out. However, they were eligible for Rs15,000 and Rs25,000 in incentives because they paid their loans regularly. ?The outstanding amount of the farmers who got their loans restructured in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is Rs3,500 crore and Rs5,200 crore,? said an official from the cooperation department.In a reply to both the houses of the state legislature, Fadnavis said that the government would ensure that the package was not misused by ineligible people. He also refused to concede to the opposition?s demand to extend the cut off date to June 30, 2017 from June 30, 2016. He argued that this would set a bad precedent and was against the norms of the Reserve Bank of India. Fadnavis also attacked the opposition for alleged anomalies in the 2008-09 loan waiver package. He said at the time farmers in five-suicide prone districts in Vidarbha were given Rs286 crore, while farmers in Mumbai got Rs208 crore. ?There were beneficiaries from Mumbai who were not even farmers. They used this amount for commercial and construction works. A major chunk of waiver went to ghost accounts. Some of the banks even had revived their dormant accounts to reap the benefits.

Why do passports have four primary colours?,"If you've never had the time to think as to why passports around the world come in the limited colours that they do, allow us to enlighten you today. Shades of red, green, blue and black are the four colours that dominate the universe of passports--and not without good reason. As per a report by Business Insider a certain Hrant Boghossian has some reasons to attribute to the choice of passport colours. The Vice President of Marketing at Arton Capital--a firm that headlines ""interactive passport database, Passport Index,"" believes that while essentially the colours are limited, nations experiment with the hues of these four primary shades that can be attributed to ""many possible scenarios.""Here's a breakdown of things.Blue: Countries whose passports are blue in colour are believed to belong to the so-called 'new-world' league of nations. These nations include India, North America, South America, Australia among others. Red: Considered to be the colour of the communist movement worldwide, red generally belongs to countries that have had a communist history or are still under its influence. China, Serbia, Latvia among others are examples.",world,1154,43,70
Dhoni signs autograph mid-match for pitch-invading fan,"The Vijay Hazare trophy quarter-final between Vidarbha and Jharkhand was all about one man. Rarely has a domestic match at this venue grabbed such attendance, but with Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the centre, all the commotion was expected. With Vidarbha managing just 159, the crowd at the Air Force Sports Complex in Palam was waiting for their hero to come out to bat. Every time a batsman got out, the crowd started chanting 'Dhoni Dhoni' but the Jharkhand skipper wouldn't oblige.

I won't sledge Virat Kohli: Australia's Glenn Maxwell,"Australia allrounder Glenn Maxwell has said he would not risk provoking India captain Virat Kohli in the upcoming four-Test series starting February 23 in Pune.Maxwell, who is a friend of Kohli off the field, said he would not say anything to Kohli that would rile him up. (R Ashwin will be ready for me but I have my game plan: David Warner to India Today)Kohli is in red-hot form, leading the way in all three formats. He recently became the first batsman to hammer double hundreds in four consecutive series. His first (200) came against West Indies and he then followed that up with another one (211) against New Zealand. After that, Kohli scored his career-best 235 in Mumbai against England and again slammed a 204 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad this month.""I am probably not going to say anything to him, that is for sure. Virat is up and down, I suppose, with sledging. If you (strike) a chord with him, or something gets him agitated to play a big shot, then blokes are more than welcome to go for it. (Virat Kohli leading the way in all three formats: David Warner to India Today)""But at the moment, there's not much agitating him,"" Maxwell told cricket.com.au.Former Australia batsman Michael Hussey has already warned Steve Smith and Co. not to sledge Kohli as it would bring the best out of him.However, soon after landing in India, Australian skipper Smith said his team won't shy away from sledging and indulging in verbal battles against India. (Australia won't shy away from sledging Virat Kohli's India: Steve Smith)Maxwell agreed with his captain and said his teammates were most welcome to sledge Kohli if they feel.""I think Steve Smith said it perfectly in the press conference yesterday - the guys that want to get involved verbally, if that gets the best out of them then go for it,"" Maxwell added.Top-ranked India are on a brilliant run, unbeaten in 19 Tests over a 16-month period with South Africa, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh all vanquished at home, while trips to Sri Lanka and West Indies also culminated in victories.By contrast, Smith's side were thrashed 3-0 in Sri Lanka and lost the first two tests of a three-match home series against South Africa before wholesale changes led to a consolation win in Adelaide and the new charges went on to sweep aside Pakistan.Maxwell feels that the India right-hander is on top of his game at the moment and the best way to get him is by shattering his confidence with a silly run-out or an unfortunate dismissal.""I don't think it's anything particular as far as technique or anything like that, I just think he's so on top of his game at the moment,"" Maxwell said.""Guys can go through a run of form like that where they just get on a roll and everything seems to click for them, and that's happened for him at the moment.""""The thing with that is it can take only one bit of bad luck or an unfortunate dismissal where he's run out or something, and that can sometimes trigger a little bit of indecision or doubt.""""So hopefully in the first couple of Tests we can create that doubt and get him wondering about his technique,"" he added.",general,3114,53,70

No separate VVIP lanes at toll plazas: UP govt,"The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday revoked its decision to provide a dedicated corridor at toll plazas for lawmakers in case of traffic snarls, after drawing flak from the opposition.Additional Chief Secretary Sadakant issued letters to all district magistrates and divisional commissioners ?modifying? an advisory dated July 13, which he said had led to confusion and raised a number of questions.It was mentioned in the advisory that in case of long traffic jams at toll collection centres and plazas, there should be a provision for separate lane for VVIPs.?...it is being made clear that for the VVIPs, no separate lane at the toll plazas will be constructed. All the facilities which are existing at the toll plazas/toll collection centres will be applicable for all the citizens. The previously issued advisory stands modified,? the additional chief secretary said in the letter.The July 13 advisory had drawn flak from opposition parties which alleged that instead of providing separate lanes to emergency vehicles, like ambulances, the government was doing so for politicians.UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh had said, ?On one hand the government had declared that it wanted to curb VIP culture by removing red and blue beacons from ministers and officials vehicles, and on the other it was passing such orders which will only strengthen VIP culture.?",general,1368,46,70
Gurugram museum to showcase an antique Kolkata tram,"West Bengal State Transport Corporation is selling off its antique trams. According to the last count WBSTC possessed some 269 tram cars. Of these at least 50 are antique, wooden models and most are no longer in working order. Out of these the corporation has short listed some 12 trams for sale. The first tram has been sold to a bidder from Chandigarh, who reportedly wants to refurbish it into a restaurant. Earlier in teh day a second tram was sold to the heritage Transport Museum in Manesar, Gurgaon.An official of the department said that WBSTC has some 130-140 trams in working order. However only about 80-90 trams are pressed into service daily as tram routes have shrunk and the ongoing metro work has also hampered operations in a few routes.The Heritage Transport Museum in Manesar is a private museum that showcases the evolution of transportation in India. It is situated off the NH 8 at Tauru-Gurgaon. It has a built up area of over 90,000 square feet of air conditioned space spread over four floors.The displays include pre mechanised transportation. A car gallery features over 75 models of classic cars. Innovative Indian transports like the famous 'jugaad' - basically a water pump powering a four wheeled platform find a place beside two wheelers - both bikes and scooters of vintage flavour.

Microsoft to shut down MS Paint 32 years after its launch,"Microsoft?s next Windows 10 update, called the Autumn (or Fall in the US) Creators Update, will bring a variety of new features. But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSoft?s PC Paintbrush, it wasn?t until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing. But it is not an update to original Paint and doesn?t behave like it.Now Microsoft has announced that, alongside Outlook Express, Reader app and Reading list, Microsoft Paint has been signalled for death having been added to the ?features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update? list.Falling under the deprecated column for apps that are ?not in active development and might be removed in future releases?, Microsoft Paint?s ticket has been called and now it?s only a matter of time before it is removed like your favourite piece of old furniture from your childhood home.Paint was never one of the most capable apps, and was limited to the bitmap (BMP) and PCX formats until 1998, but if you wanted to scribble something out using your mouse or make a quick cut and paste job, Paint was always there, even on work computers.The most recent version of Paint for Windows 7 and later was much improved, but still considered feature poor compared to other free alternatives such as the third-party Paint.NET.When Microsoft Paint will officially be removed from Windows has yet to be confirmed, while a precise date for the release of the Windows 10 Autumn Creators Update is equally up in the air. Whether, like Clippy, Windows users will celebrate or decry Paint?s removal, it will be a moment in the history of Windows as one of its longest-standing apps is put out to pasture.",technology,2180,57,70
Pope Francis compares reading fake news to eating poop,"Pope Francis has lambasted media organisations that focus on scandals and smears and promote fake news as a means of discrediting people in public life. Spreading disinformation was ?probably the greatest damage that the media can do?, the pontiff told the Belgian Catholic weekly Tertio. It is a sin to defame people, he added.Using striking terminology, Francis said journalists and the media must avoid falling into ?coprophilia? ? an abnormal interest in excrement. Those reading or watching such stories risked behaving like coprophagics, people who eat faeces, he added.The pope excused himself for using terminology that some might find repellent. ?I think the media have to be very clear, very transparent, and not fall into ? no offence intended ? the sickness of coprophilia, that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true,? he said. ?And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done.?He also spoke of the danger of using the media to slander political rivals. ?The means of communication have their own temptations, they can be tempted by slander, and therefore used to slander people, to smear them, this above all in the world of politics,? he said. ?They can be used as means of defamation. No one has a right to do this. It is a sin and it is hurtful.?Disinformation was the greatest potential harm the media could cause, he said, because ?it directs opinion in only one direction and omits the other part of the truth?. Wednesday?s interview was not the first time Francis has made the same point in unusual language. A year before being elected pope, he told the Italian newspaper La Stampa: ?Journalists sometimes risk becoming ill from coprophilia and thus fomenting coprophagia, which is a sin that taints all men and women ? that is, the tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects.?The pope?s latest comments on disinformation were made against a backdrop of a global debate over the proliferation of fake news websites and stories that present events through a highly partisan lens.In the US, some observers have suggested that fake news could have swayed the presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. On 19 November the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced new steps to counter fake news on the platform, marking a departure from his scepticism that online misinformation was, as Barack Obama has put it, a threat to democratic institutions.The ?Pizzagate? conspiracy theory, which led to a self-radicalised gunman discharging his weapon in a popular pizza restaurant in Washington DC on Sunday, was spread with the help of fake news stories falsely accusing the owners of being part of a nonexistent paedophile ring with supposed ties to Hillary Clinton.",world,2803,54,70
Current GST a mockery and imperfect: Former Finance Minister,"Almost a week after the rollout of the landmark Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Congress today called it ""imperfect"" and a ""mockery"" of the original draft, and added that it should have been delayed by at least two months since it fails to achieve its purpose in its current form.""The GST rollout should have been delayed by two months. The GST Network should have undergone a dry run before implementation,"" former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said in a press conference in New Delhi.""This is not the GST the UPA government had envisaged. It's imperfect, a mockery of GST,"" Chidambaram said, adding that his party, the Congress, will press for the reduction in rates and an 18 per cent cap. ""The aim was that one indirect tax will subsume all other indirect taxes. This GST fails to achieve that,"" he said.The senior Congress leader demanded that real estate, electricity and petroleum products must be brought under GST. Citing the example of the crisis in the Tamil Nadu film industry, Chidambaram said there are seven rates in the current GST. On top of that, the states have also been allowed to impose their own taxes, which is creating the crisis.""It is not the true GST. There must be a trial run for two months to allow the industry and companies to clear their stocks and then a proper rollout should have happened from September,"" he said.On the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly passing the GST Bill, Chidambaram said it does not dilute Article 370. ""For Jammu and Kashmir, it is possible to implement GST without diluting Article 370. For that, you need deliberation, not the acrimony,"" he said.",general,1605,60,70
Shortage of over 5 lakh police personnel in India,"There is a shortage of over 5 lakh police personnel in the country as compared to their overall sanctioned strength, the government told Parliament on Tuesday.The union home ministry, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha, also said that there are fewer Indian Police Service (IPS) officers in position across the country, than their authorised strength.?As on January 1, 2017, there are 3,905 IPS officers in position against an authorised strength of 4,843,? minister of state for home Hansraj G Ahir said.The minister said that according to the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), as on January 1, 2016, against the authorised strength of 22,80,691, there are 17,31,666 police personnel in position.Ahir said about 150 officers are recruited every year in the IPS and the central government reviews the strength and composition of each state IPS cadre, ordinarily at the interval of every five years.?Since 2014, cadre review of 11 cadres has already been notified by the central government,? he said.",politics,1017,49,70
A person displaced every second by crises in 2016: Report,"Conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than 31 million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.But while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council?s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Alexandra Bilak, director of the IDMC, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. ?Not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you?re missing part of the picture,? she said. ?If you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,? added Bilak.Last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. Worst affected was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 922,000 were displaced, a 50% rise on the previous year. Close behind was Syria (824,000), followed by Iraq (659,000), Afghanistan (653,000), Nigeria (501,000) and Yemen (478,000).Disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing 24.2 million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. This trend was at its most acute in east Asia and the Pacific. In China, 7.4 million were forced from their homes, with 5.9 million affected in the Philippines and a further 2.4 million in India. Floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. In some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report?s authors noted. It pointed to the situations unfolding in Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. Bilak said the number of displacements due to violence in DRC was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. ?Unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.?In May last year, the UN proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030. The report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.Last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.?What we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,? said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.He said there is a link with refugees ? though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 ? Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria ? were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. ?First, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,? he said. ?It?s incredible there?s not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni conflict. We also need to get economic life to countries like Yemen and elsewhere so there?s not a collapse in social structures there. Then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.?",science,3842,57,70

Religious leader with 25 wives convicted of polygamy,"Two men, including one who has 25 wives and 146 children, were convicted of polygamy Monday in a landmark ruling that upheld Canada?s longstanding ban on the practice.Winston Blackmore and James Marion Oler, who has five wives, face up to five years in prison after being found guilty in the first real test of the country?s polygamy law, enacted 127 years ago.Three special prosecutors had been appointed over the past two decades to consider bringing charges against the pair, but they backed down over concerns that the law prohibiting polygamy violated Canadians? constitutional right to religious freedom.Those fears were assuaged in 2011 when British Columbia province?s Supreme Court ruled in a reference case that the inherent harms of polygamy justified putting limits on religious freedoms, clearing the way for charges to be filed against Blackmore and Oler three years later.Judge Sheri Ann Donegan of the British Columbia Supreme Court noted in her ruling that the main defendant, Blackmore, did not deny his polygamy.?His adherence to the practices and beliefs of the FLDS is not in dispute,? she said.The two men are senior figures in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), a polygamist religious sect that broke away from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church.The sect has been based for nearly 60 years in the remote, mountainous region of British Columbia near the US border where the community grows, raises or hunts its own food and runs a barter economy.",world,1551,52,70
Election Commission to hold EVM hackathon in May-end,"Amid criticism and even scepticism from various quarters over the functioning of the electronic voting machines (EVMs), the Election Commission has decided to hold an open hackathon for people to try and hack the voting machines in the last week of May.Last month, the poll panel had said it may invite experts, scientists, technocrats, and representatives of political parties to hack the machines, which it claims are tamper-proof. The Election Commission had announced a similar challenge in 2009 and no one could hack the EVMs.A number of Opposition parties, including the Congress, have alleged tampering of the EVMs after the recent Assembly elections. A delegation of 16 parties recently met President Pranab Mukherjee and submitted a memorandum on the alleged tampering of the voting machines during the February-March elections.Earlier today, the Election Commission also said it is likely to convene an all-party meeting on May 12 to discuss the issue of reliability of EVMs flagged by the Opposition parties.The parties have urged the Election Commission to revert to ballot system, claiming that the faith of the people in EVMs has been ""eroded"".Also read:Electronic Voting Machine: Here's all you wanted to know about India's EVMsHack an EVM challenge: Election Commission dares anyone to tamper voting device successfully",politics,1336,52,70
"Agra, Noida face drought conditions after 53% less rain","India is called a land of vast diversities and as almost always, this monsoon is serving to show exactly how vast the diversity is. When large parts of Northeast and West India are being inundated by heavy rains, causing property damage worth crores and claiming lives of men and animals alike, most of the Ganga-Yamuna plain area of Uttar Pradesh is parched due to lack of rainfall.Farmers in the northeast have lost their crops to the heavy rains and in Uttar Pradesh, the farmers are afraid of losing their crops to the dry season. Five districts of UP, Agra, Pilibhit, Muzaffar Nagar, Ghaziabad and Noida are facing a serious drought that is showing no signs of lifting anytime soon.A senior administrative official told India Today that out of 72 districts in UP, 44 are yet to have decent rainfall in the monsoon season. Farms are drying up in these districts, but out of these, the worst affected five districts are gearing up for contingency plans in case the monsoon decides to skip these districts altogether. The heat and humidity is making people fall sick and although the Yamuna river is flowing with ample water to ward off any drinking water crisis, vegetable prices are shooting sky-high.The month of July ends in two days, but the monsoon clouds have overflown these districts, especially the western UP, where 21 cities of 30 districts have seen very low rainfall. In east UP, 23 out of 42 cities have not had satisfactory rains. The affected districts of western UP include Agra, Oraiyya, Badaun, Bulandshehar, Etawah, Firozabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Jhansi, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, Hathras, Mahoba, Mathura, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Rampur, Pilibhit, Saharanpur, and Etah.Agra's neighboring district Mainpuri has had 307.99 mm rains in July, Etah has had 274.3 mm, Firozabad has had 244.4 mm, while Mathura has had only 164.3 mm rainfall. A Meteorological Department official told India Today that the drought affected 5 districts have had seriously low rainfall this July.Agra has had 53 per cent lower rainfall this year, with just 123.5 mm rainfall. The average for July is 260.4 mm. Rampur lost 52 per cent of its annual rainfall and got only 191.3 mm rains compared to the average of 399.4 mm. Noida got just 96 mm rains against an average of 204.2 mm, making a shortfall of 53 per cent. Ghaziabad had 105.8 mm rains against 238.6 mm average, with a shortfall of 56 per cent. Muzaffar Nagar lost 61% of its water, getting only 120.4 mm rains compared to 305.2 mm average. Similarly, Pilibhit too lost 62 per cent water this month, getting 152.8 mm rains against 403 mm average.Commenting on the lack of rains in Agra, social activist Vishal Sharma quoted a small verse ""Shukr hai Agra mein nahin baraste badal, mere sheher ko barish ki aadat nahin hai"". He said that although the dry season brings its own set of problems, it is a fact that Agra is not equipped to handle rains that last even an hour, let alone an entire day. The civic amenities in the city are prone to failure in the event of heavy rains due to the lack of drainage in most of the city, as was witnessed a couple of years earlier when heavy rainfall caused vast property damage in the city and the municipal authorities struggled for days to clear the water-logging in the low-lying areas.Sharma said that even this month, the rainfall that took place a couple of days back, claimed the roofs of several old houses in Motikatra, Nagla Joshiyan and other parts of the old city, injuring a number of people. Several houses were also cracked, although the rain was not enough to cause serious water logging. However, even 40-50 mm rainfall in a day would be enough to cut off most of the densely populated outer areas from the rest of the city for several hours, if not days.Meanwhile, Agra District Magistrate Gaurav Dayal has instructed all Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Additional District Magistrates of Agra to prepare reports of the drought so that the compensation amounts could be decided for the farmers.ALSO READ:",general,4027,55,70

MP whose behaviour resulted in 'no-fly' rule hails the move,"Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who was temporarily banned from domestic flight travel after he assaulted a 60-year old Air India staffer, has now called for guidelines to control the behaviour of airline staff.Earlier on Friday, the civil aviation ministry announced a new set of guidelines for dealing with unruly passengers on flights. The government announced draft rules for a national 'no-fly list' which proposes a ban on domestic air travel that can last for a period ranging from three months, to two years or beyond.Gaikwad called it a ""welcome move,"" but he had more to say.""But these are just draft guidelines. I think there should be stricter guidelines for the airline staff as well"" Gaikwad told India Today in Mumbai.""Sometimes even passengers have to suffer due to the behaviour of airline staff, that also should have some strict guidelines...Forget us, we usually fly on domestic routes, but you can ask passengers who travel long distance,"" he added.THREE LEVELS OF OFFENCESThe proposed draft has three levels of offences that can lead to a person being listed on the No Fly List.The first level includes disruptive behaviour such as physical gestures, punishable by suspension for three months. The second level is for physical abuse - pushing, kicking, sexual harassment and the like - punishable by a 6-month suspension.Level 3 offences include murderous assault, life-threatening behaviour, or causing damage to aircraft operating systems. The penalty for such offences would be suspension for two years or more.The new guidelines also have a penalty structure through which an unruly passenger can be fined up to Rs 5 lakh for delaying a flight by an hour, Rs 10 lakh for delays longer than an hour, and Rs 15 lakh for delays longer than two hours.",general,1773,59,70

Indonesians protest after Christian Guv jailed for blasphemy,"The jailing of Jakarta?s Christian governor on blasphemy charges has sparked outrage from his supporters in Indonesia, rights organisations and the EU.On Tuesday, a court in the capital of the world?s largest Muslim-majority country found Basuki Tjahaja Purnama ? better known by his nickname Ahok ? guilty of blasphemy, sentencing him to two years in prison.?The EU has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy when applied in a discriminatory manner can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief,? the EU delegation to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam said in a statement posted on its website. The Jakarta-based rights group the Setara Institute described the verdict as a ?trial by mob?, while the British ambassador to Indonesia, Moazzam Malik, who is Muslim, tweeted a message of support.I know Ahok. Admire his wk for Jkt. Believe he isn't antiMuslim. Praying for BuVero&kids. Leaders must step up to protect tolerance&harmony. https://t.co/JcxsteEfB4At City Hall on Wednesday morning, an estimated 1,000 people wearing red and white, Indonesia?s national colours, gathered for a spontaneous choir performance in support of Ahok. Conducted by the musician Addie MS, the crowd sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, and Pancasila Garuda, a song about Indonesia?s founding principles of unity and diversity.When words fail, music speaks #paduansuarabalaikota #ahok #saveahok #peace #nkrihargamati #garudapancasila pic.twitter.com/CdY64EGiDNOthers registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means ?rest in peace Indonesian law?.The Ahok case has been watched closely as a marker of the commitment to religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia, where religious hardliners have been playing an increasingly prominent role in politics.In an unusual move, the panel of five judges on Tuesday dismissed the prosecutor?s recommendations to drop the initial blasphemy charges due to insufficient evidence. Prosecutors had recommended the governor instead face a sentence of two years? probation, and one year in jail if he reoffended. But the judges ? citing among others the ?expert? opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader ? said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Qur?anic verse on the campaign trail last September. The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesia?s reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its ?unjust? blasphemy law. Ahok has indicated he will appeal against the ruling.",world,3263,60,70
Chinese media urges India to return 1962 war prisoner,"China's State media has urged India to take steps to enable a former Chinese soldier, who has been residing in Madhya Pradesh after being imprisoned shortly after the 1962 war, to return to China to visit his family.The story of Wang Qi, who was a Chinese army surveyor who strayed into India in January 1963 and subsequently imprisoned until 1969, has garnered increasing attention in China after a report last week by the BBC describing his life in the village of Tirodi, in MP, and his desire to return to visit his family.On Friday, the Global Times, a widely-read Party run newspaper published by the People's Daily, strongly urged India to issue relevant documents to allow Wang, who reports said is now in his eighties, to return on humanitarian grounds. Wang was issued a passport by the Chinese Embassy in 2003 but denied permission to travel to see his ailing mother, who died in 2006.The Global Times said: ""Wang's story caused quite a stir on China's social media and appeals are rising that the man should be helped back home as soon as possible. There is also speculation that India is deliberately making it difficult for Wang, blocking him from returning to China,"" it claimed.WANG DELIBERATELY WITHHELD?The Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi said it was looking at ""how best"" the matter could be handled.

It is high time for the Indian authorities to take the case seriously and process it efficiently. If Wang's hope for a reunion with his family in China is shattered in India's red tape, that will hurt the feelings of a massive number of Chinese netizens.""The paper cited the case of two veteran Chinese soldiers, captured in 1962, who were returned in 2003 in what was ""conceived as a goodwill gesture that both countries hoped would lead them out of the shadow of the 1962 war.""""Although it's unclear whether Wang is a prisoner of war, it is inhumane to have isolated the elderly man from his family for such a long time,"" the Global Times said. ""The Indian authorities should give their utmost attention to this case, actively communicating with the Chinese Embassy and improving administrative efficiency in processing this case, while the Chinese side should cooperate to provide the necessary documents pertaining to Wang that India requires.""WANG ALIAS RAJ BAHADURThe BBC reported that Wang said he had strayed into India while carrying out land surveying duties for the Chinese army, and picked up by the Indian Red Cross Society.He was jailed and transferred around several Indian states before being released in 1969 and sent to the remote village of Tirodi, which is a five hour drive from Nagpur.

Not quitting as BJP President: Amit Shah,"BJP chief Amit Shah on Monday said he is happy being the party president and ruled out joining Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre. Shah?s filing of nomination for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections from Gujarat triggered speculation about him joining the Union ministry.The buzz about possible ministry expansion has been generated as many ministers are currently holding multiple crucial portfolios in the National Democratic Alliance government. Finance minister Arun Jaitley is holding the additional charge of the defence ministry since Manohar Parrikar left the government in April to take over as chief minister of Goa. M Venkaiah Naidu, who was holding information and broadcasting, urban development, housing and urban poverty alleviation portfolios, has been nominated as NDA?s candidate for the post of vice president creating more vacancies. Science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan is holding the additional environment portfolio since the demise of Anil Dave. There are talks that Shah, Modi?s closest confidant, was given the Rajya Sabha nomination to pave the way for his induction into the Union ministry. ?I am very happy with my job and discharging my responsibilities with full devotion, you don?t speculate,? a vividly relaxed Shah said while interacting with media persons on Monday, the concluding day of his three-day Lucknow visit. Shah also rubbished the allegations that under him the BJP is creating rifts in the Opposition ranks be it in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat. The Congress recently flew out a group of its MLAs from Gujarat to Karnataka ahead of August 8 Rajya Sabha elections, accusing the BJP of trying to lure them. ?Accha chalo Gujarat mein toh hamari sarkaar hai, par inhoney Bengaluru mein kyon vidhayakon ko kamrey main band kar rakha hai (Ok, it?s a BJP government in Gujarat but why have they kept their MLAs confined to a room in Congress-ruled Karanataka?s capital Bengaluru,? Shah asked. ?Arrey bhai, wahan toh unhe ghoomney do (at least let them move freely there),? he said with a smile. He was flanked by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma. ?Hamne koi dal nahi toda hai (we have not broken any party),? he said, denying BJP had any role in the breakup of Bihar?s grand alliance?What could we do when Nitish Kumar himself decided to resign and sever ties with the RJD? Was I expected to stop him from doing so at the gun point? We did not have a hand in the developments there as Nitishji wasn?t interested in continuing with those accused of corruption,? Shah said, referring to recent change of political equation in Bihar. On Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav?s allegation that the BJP is indulging in ?political corruption? in UP by engineering resignations of his party MLCs, Shah said he wasn?t aware of any such move by the BJP. Asked if the SP MLCs, who recently left the party, would join the BJP and would get ?return gift? from him, he said, ?I don?t know whether they would be joining the BJP? The local unit might have planned something. But, as far as return gift is concerned, this is not BJP?s culture.?Several SP and BSP leaders had joined the BJP ahead of the 2017 assembly polls in UP and many of them were given tickets and are now ministers in Adityanath government. However, Shah said those leaders after quitting their parties had contested an election, there by indicating that his party had not poached on opposition lawmakers in the middle of their term.He denied any plan to induct disgruntled Samajwadi Party MLA Shivpal Yadav into the BJP. Shivpal and his nephew Akhilesh Yadav are the central characters in the bitter intra-party conflict in the SP. On the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi land dispute in Ayodhya, Shah said his party is in favour of building a temple at the disputed site either through a court order or by creating a consensus on the issue.",politics,3925,40,70
64-year-old becomes oldest mother in China to deliver baby,"From K J M Varma Beijing, Dec 30 (PTI) A 64-year-old woman in China is believed to have become the oldest mother in the country to give birth to a baby. The mother, who has not been identified, delivered a boy weighing 3.7 kgs through cesarean section at a hospital in Jilin province, official media here reported. She conceived the baby after receiving in vitro fertilisation abroad. Photos uploaded to social media yesterday showed the woman in a delivery room and a nurse holding a newborn. The woman and her husband declined to be interviewed, but people close to the family said the couple decided to have the baby after losing their first child, state-run China Daily reported. Teng Hong, a doctor who helped with the delivery, said the mother went through menopause about a decade ago. She was able to conceive after undergoing in vitro fertilisation overseas. Due to her age, the woman faced a lot of health risks during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes and internal bleeding, Teng said. ""But shes very strong. She received treatment with an optimistic attitude and overcame all the difficulties to gave birth,"" Teng said. She said the baby is in good condition. As the woman is no longer able to lactate, the child is being fed baby formula. ""Were keeping a close eye on the mother because women of this age can encounter cardiac failure and uncontrollable bleeding during or after a C-section, which are very dangerous,"" Teng said. In recent years, China has seen several cases of older women having children. Although there is no official data, including who is the oldest, anecdotal evidence suggests most of the older women had another baby after they lost their first child. Teng said she had a patient who gave birth two years ago at age 53 after losing a child, while in July, a 61-year-old gave birth after her only daughter died of disease at 30.",general,1876,58,70

"How does Railways plan to earn extra ?40,000 cr in 10 years?","The railways today spelt out a target of Rs 40,000 crore revenue from monetising its soft assets in the next 10 years. In a two-pronged strategy, the railways aims to increase earnings through traditional as well as non-traditional sources, while at the same time reducing expenditure. ""Earlier the railways used to focus on traditional sources for revenue earnings, that is passenger fares and freight. Now, we have firmed up the non-fare revenue policy aiming to earn about Rs 40,000 crore in the next 10 years,"" Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said at an event here.

Passenger-related data would be be monetised under the NFR strategy. Besides data, the railways will be allowing branding of trains and launching a mega app as part of the monetisation of soft assets in a big way. Noting that railways witnesses more than eight billion footfalls and eyeballs in a year, Prabhu said, ""If we can monetise it, the railways can capture the immense value from it."" Railways is putting up about two lakh big LCD screens at 2,000 stations across the country to operationalise the rail display network disseminating rail-related informations besides advertisements.

"Indian Army considering to reduce its 'sahayaks' by 10,000","The Indian Army, after consultations with the Defence Ministry, is considering cutting down the numbers of its sahayaks or 'buddies' by 25 percent. This would translate to around 10,000 jawans as there are currently about 40,000 sahayaks in the Indian Army. The move would come in the wake of the controversy over the tasks Indian Army sahayaks perform for officers and junior commissioned officers.Under the army's 'buddy's system, sahayak jawans are attached to officers and junior commissioned officers. A sahayak's tasks include working with the officer or JCO for army-related duties. According to top army sources, the 10,000 sahayak jawans will be replaced by civilians. The civilian substitutes will be employed for officers in static formations such as the Army Headquarters or units in the Delhi area and not operational locations like battalions, brigades and division and corps headquarters. Once their civilian replacements are in the place, the 10,000 sahayak jawans will be moved to army formations across the country. This is perhaps the first step in the dismantling of the army's sahayak or 'buddy' system. The Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force do not have such a system in place.The age-old system recently came into the spotlight after a few jawans posted grievance-filled videos on social media.

HC stays AAP govt's distance criteria for nursery admissions,"The Delhi high court on Tuesday stayed a controversial nursery admission notification by the AAP government that made 298 private unaided schools, built on public land, to accept admission forms based only on the neighbourhood or distance criteria.Justice Manmohan termed the notification as ?arbitrary, unreasonable and against the public interest? before ordering a stay on its application on the private unaided schools for this year?s nursery admission process.Earlier, the court had directed the private schools to accept applications based on their own criteria as well as city administration guidelines. Tuesday?s order will give the schools a free hand to admit toddlers using their own criteria.?State cannot impose a restriction on choice of parents to choose a school for their wards just because it is beneficial for the child,? justice Manmohan remarked.Around 150,000 aspirants vie for 125,000 seats every year but the process gets caught in last-minute litigation as either parents or schools go to court almost every year.The court also questioned the city government?s decision to impose the neighbourhood restriction to only those schools that are built on Delhi Development Authority land.?Public interest cannot be confined to 298 schools,? justice Manmohan remarked adding, ?primary cause of nursery admission chaos is the lack of good schools in the capital?.The court?s order came on pleas by the Action Committee for Unaided Recognised Private Schools ? comprising more than 450 private unaided recognised schools in Delhi ? and the Forum for Promotion of Quality Education and some parents challenging the government?s January 7 notification.The notification gave priority to those living within a radius of 1 kilometre. In case seats remained vacant, those living within a 3-kilometre radius could get a chance. Which meant these schools could no longer deny admission to anyone from the neighbourhood.Earlier, the high court stayed city government?s controversial nursery admission notification that made it mandatory for private unaided minority schools to admit students, in the unreserved category, on the basis of neighbourhood criteria.The order gave relief to around 15 minority schools in the capital that were set up on public land.",general,2267,60,70

ISIS on back foot in Afghanistan post leader's death: US,"By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jul 18 (PTI) The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) has lost its hold in Afghanistan, days after the terror groups head Abu Sayed, was killed by US troops in an airstrike, the Pentagon has said. The Pentagon now estimates that ISIS-K in Afghanistan numbers somewhere in the hundreds. ""We dont think its over 1,000. They hold no meaningful territory in Nangarhar province. There are certainly fighters there but theyre mostly spending their time trying to stay alive,"" said Pentagon Spokesman Navy Capt Jeff Davis. During an off-camera news conference yesterday, Davis said the killing of ISIS-K leader Abu Sayed in a drone strike last week disrupted it?s expansion plans. ""His death will further disrupt the groups plans to expand its operations in Afghanistan,"" he said, adding that this is the third time in the past year that US forces in Afghanistan have killed a sitting leader of ISIS-K. ""Killed in a kinetic strike on July 11 in Kunar, Abu Syed was the overall ISIS-K Amir in Afghanistan for only six weeks, issuing operational guidance, financial management and acting as the primary decision-maker for operations with ISIS- throughout Afghanistan,"" he said. ""His death comes not long after that of his predecessor, Sheikh Abdul Hasib, who was killed by US forces in a raid on April 26 in Achin, Nangarhar province as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan,"" he added.

Other Congress leaders have also been named in the FIR, in which the police alleged that 14 police personnel, including four sub-inspectors and a woman constable, were injured.?The FIR is lodged at Sahibabad police station and we have arrested three persons in this connection. Teams are on the lookout for other persons and trying to identify them through video footage,? Akash Tomar, superintendent of police (city), said.A large number of locals and Congress workers started gathering outside the Haj House near river Hindon from Monday afternoon, despite prohibitory orders in place in the district. The police also charged them under Section 188 of the IPC, which is applied only when prohibitory orders are violated.?Naseem Khan and Puja Chaddha are not traceable. We will protest against the police and the administration and will also hand them a memorandum about the lathi charge carried out by police on innocent people who were staging a peaceful dharna outside the Haj House. There were some miscreants who resorted to violence but they were outsiders,? said Harendra Kasana, district president of the Congress.For the last one week, since the Haj pilgrimage is on, locals have been demanding that the newly constructed Haj House, which was inaugurated by former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in September 2016, be opened.However, the Haj House is caught up in litigation after three residents approached the National Green Tribunal and demanded its demolition, contending that the structure was built on land chunks of the Hindon floodplains.The tribunal on September 2, 2016, had said in its order, ?We make it clear that any steps or construction taken in the meanwhile shall be subject to the orders of the Tribunal passed in this Application (sic).?Earlier on July 27, Hindustan Times had published a report listing the reasons for closure of the facility.

The decision was taken to protect the environment and the river ecology. The influx of thousands of pilgrims is bound to create garbage issues in the river zone.

French Prez denounces country's role in Holocaust atrocity,"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has denounced France?s collaboration in the Holocaust, criticising those who negate or minimise the country?s role in sending tens of thousands of Jews to their deaths.After he and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, attended a Holocaust commemoration, Macron also appealed for renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Worried that Netanyahu is backing away from commitment to a two-state solution, Macron assailed Jewish settlement construction as a threat to international hopes for peace.Commemorating 75 years since a mass roundup of Jews during the darkest chapter of modern French history, Macron insisted ?it was indeed France that organised this?.?Not a single German? was directly involved, he said, but French police collaborating with the Nazis.Holocaust survivors recounted wrenching stories at the ceremony at the site of Vel d?Hiv stadium near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where police herded 13,000 people on 16-17 July 1942 before they were deported to camps. More than 4,000 were children. Fewer than 100 survived.They were among about 76,000 Jews deported from France to Nazi camps.It was a half century later when then-President Jacques Chirac became the first French leader to acknowledge the state?s role in the Holocaust?s horrors.Macron dismissed arguments by French far-right leaders and others that the collaborationist Vichy regime didn?t represent France.?It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness . Yes, it?s convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie,? he said.French Jewish leaders hailed Macron?s speech on Sunday ? even as critics railed at him online, where renewed antisemitism has flourished. Macron pledged to fight racism, and called for a thorough investigation into the recent killing of a Parisian woman believed to be linked to anti-Jewish sentiment.Netanyahu said that ?recently we have witnessed a rise of extremist forces that seek to destroy not only the Jews, but of course the Jewish state as well, but well beyond that ... The zealots of militant Islam, who seek to destroy you, seek to destroy us as well. We must stand against them together.?Pro-Palestinian and other activists protested against Netanyahu?s appearance in Paris, criticising Jewish settlement policy and the blockade of Gaza.Macron condemned an attack last week that killed two Israeli police officers at a Jerusalem shrine revered by Jews and Muslims, and said he was committed to Israel?s security ? but warned that continued Jewish settlement construction threatened peace efforts.?I call for a resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in the framework of the search for a solution of two states, Israel and Palestine, living in recognised, secure borders with Jerusalem as the capital,? Macron told reporters.At his side, Netanyahu said, ?We share the same desire for a peaceful Middle East,? but didn?t elaborate on eventual peace talks.While Macron has been flexing his diplomatic skills by reaching out to President Donald Trump and others, he did not indicate any eagerness for France to spearhead such negotiations, after a lacklustre French Middle East diplomatic effort under his predecessor early this year.Macron and Netanyahu also discussed fighting extremism in Syria and elsewhere, and improving economic cooperation. ?

Centre mulls jailing NGO heads hiding public funds,"Heads of NGOs, which misappropriate government funds or do not file annual statement, may soon go to jail or be slapped with hefty fines as penalty.There could be criminal proceedings for misappropriation and civil action for recovery of given funds.The Modi government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that a legislation may soon be enacted in this regard and discussions are on at the top level to include a penal provision to punish errant NGOs""A penal provision needs to be made as it cannot be included in the mere guidelines. A separate regime is required for provision of punishment or fine,"" Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud.The ASG's comments came when the CJI said: ""This is a very serious issue. Our directions are already there. You just implement it so that the authorities who are overseeing the activities of the NGOs get more teeth."" The SC had in its order in April asked the Centre to examine enacting a law to regulate government funds for NGOs and prosecute them in case of misuse, misappropriation of funds or non-filing of statements.Passing detailed orders on the PIL by advocate M L Sharma in 2011, to seek a tab on functioning of NGOs, the bench had said mere blacklisting of NGOs who do not file annual statements will not suffice. Criminal proceedings for misappropriation and civil action for recovery of given funds must be initiated. ""Rs950 crore is being given in total to all NGOs every year. This is a phenomenal amount... tax payers money ... since 78 ministries and departments were granting money to NGOs, a law on regulating funds and work by NGOs would be much better. Inform us in eight weeks whether you want to streamline NGOs through guidelines or through legislation,"" the bench had told the government.The SC order came after senior lawyer Amucus Dwivedi cited a CBI report that said only 10 per cent of NGOs filed annual income and expenditure statements.

Tirupati Laddu caused ?140 cr annual loss for last 3 years,"Tirupati, Feb 19 (PTI) The most sought-after Tirupati Laddu has caused an annual loss of over Rs 140 crore to the cash-rich administration of Lord Venkateswara hill shrine for the last three years owing to its subsidised price and free distribution to some devotees, temple sources said. The mouth-watering sweet dish has been sold by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) at a subsidised price of Rs 25 per piece for the last 11 years while the actual cost was about Rs 32.50, the sources said. The laddu, made at the massive kitchen close to the shrine at nearby Tirumala, is in great demand among devotees, who throng the shrine from different parts of the country throughout the year. In 2016, about ten crore pieces of laddu (ball-shaped sweet) were made and sold, they told PTI. Besides the burden caused by subsidy, TTD also incurs more loss selling the laddu at Rs 10 per piece to devotees who opt for free darshan and wait for several hours in long queues, resulting in a loss of about Rs 23 crore, the sources said. The introduction of one free laddu to each devotee who treks 11-kilometre long stairway leading to the temple from the foot of the hills also adds about Rs 22.7 crore to the annual loss. The scheme was introduced in October 2013 with an aim to encourage the age-old traditional way of reaching the sacred hills on foot. Since then, on an average about 70 lakh devotees visit the temple by climbing the hills on foot annually, they said. More than 70 lakh devotees who avail Rs 300 special entry darshan and Rs 500 VIP darshan tickets were also getting two laddus free. However, the sources said the TTD was not keen on increasing the price of the laddu to offset the losses and might consider cutting down the number of free laddus given to ticket holders.",general,1785,58,70
"Madhuri's affair with Sanjay, Jackie lies, claims ex-manager","At the peak of the Madhuri Dixit craze, the actor, who turned 50 today, was linked with numerous co-actors and colleagues.

Gujarat Rajya Sabha polls to be held with NOTA option: SC,"The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the Election Commission decision allowing the NOTA provision in the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat.A bench of justices Dipak Misra, Amitava Roy and AM Khanwilkar, however, agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the August 1 notification of the poll panel allowing the NOTA option.?Issue notice.

You come here on the eve of elections,? the bench said.Sibal told the court that including NOTA will encourage corruption. ?It?s a recipe for corruption.?The NOTA ? none of the above ? option allows voters to reject all candidates in fray.

So they had to hand over their memorandum to a PMO official instead.Delhi: Tamil Nadu farmers stage nude protest outside North Block, demand drought relief fund#ITVideohttps://t.co/NounxnP7mgpic.twitter.com/vC7SpvwlO1Two other protestors joined him and started running naked in South Block. At one point, the farmers even started rolling on the street naked.The farmer who led the naked protest was eventually arrested. Here's why these farmers are protesting:1. Last year, Tamil Nadu recorded the worst spell of northeast monsoon in 140 years, leading to most farmers losing their winter crop. Most of these farmers had lost their summer crop too, due to Tamil Nadu's tussle with Kanataka over sharing water from the Cauvery river.The timing of government's demonetisation move didn't help either, as the prevailing cash crunch prevented farmers from tackling their farming expenses. Most of them couldn't even prepare for the next sowing season.2. The shock over crop loss and lack of revenue led to some farmers getting heart attacks, while many others committed suicide. At one point, an estimated 106 farmer deaths were reported within a month in Tamil Nadu. Some reports also say 144 farmers committed suicide between October to December in 2016.For the remaining farmers, loan installments and dues to moneylenders have now become the greatest problem. Most farmers haven't earned anything to come through on these payments. Farmers who tried selling their land, couldn't even find buyers because it was that dry.3. With no option left, a contingent of these farmers from Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli came to Delhi and have been protesting at Jantar Mantar since March 14.These farmers seek a drought relief fund of Rs 40,000 crore, better support for their produce and a loan waiver for peasants in Tamil Nadu. One Tamil Nadu local told Firstpost that the farmers asked for a compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre, but they were only paid Rs 5,465 per acre.4. Despite the attention their protests have received, the farmers still await a meeting with the government's top officials. To garner attention, these farmers have resorted to all kinds of methods like cutting themselves and holding dead rats and snakes in their mouth.Late in March some farmers even wore skulls of dead Tamil Nadu farmers, symbolising the fate that awaits them if the centre does not help.Two farmers even attempted suicide at Jantar Mantar.",general,2959,56,70

Delhi HC reduces aid for 'negligent' accident victim by 45%,"In an interesting ruling, the Delhi high court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45 per cent after it found negligence on the part of both the parties.Deepak Kumar, the victim, was hit by a motor vehicle driven by a government employee named Ajay Kumar in Palam.Deepak told the court that while he was on his way to work, he stopped his vehicle after crossing Palam flyover to feed a cow. While he was crossing the road, he was hit and suffered injuries. The trial court had awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to him after ruling negligence on Ajay's part.Ajay challenged the trial court order based on the detailed accident report that mentioned motorcycle was not being driven dangerously or at an excessive speed, and was being driven in its lane and within the permissible speed limit.He sought examination of the contributory negligence on behalf of the injured through advocate Trideep Pais and Pranav Jain. The court observed, ""It is possible that despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road.""""Such people apart from impairing their own lives also pose a threat to the safety and security of the ongoing traffic. The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself to dangers that such risk may entail. It exhibits his negligence towards his own safety,"" the court added.Quoting the detailed accident report, the court said if the vehicle was in good condition, being driven in the right lane at the right speed, the accident which was caused at a non-zebra crossing, could be attributed to the sudden appearance of the jaywalker in front of the vehicle.In the circumstances, a portion of the blame and negligence would have to be shared by the claimant. While noting that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, the court said, "" One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing.""""The time of the accident was about 9.40 am. The visibility was clear. The appellant could have well seen from some distance the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road,"" the court added.",general,2367,59,70

He had reportedly decided to join the militancy due to an incident in which security personnel beat up his elder brother Khalid wani. It was in the summer of 2013, when Burhan Wani's relatives approached the then DG Ashok Prasad, appealing for the cops to intervene. Sources said that close relatives of Burhan Wani approached the top cop, asking for intervention. Burhan till then was not a top militant and not even in the top 10 most wanted terrorists. The family was asked to get in touch with SP Awantipora. The matter became inconsequential till Burhan rose to the ranks and eventually become its Commander. Ashok Prasad now advisor to MHA and an official spokesperson confirmed the incident with India Today. While Burhan's brother Khalid was eventually killed by security forces in April 2015 when he had gone along with three friends to meet his brother.WANI'S BROTHER A MILITANT SYMPATHISER The security forces claimed that Khalid was a militant sympathiser who had taken his friends to get them recruited and was killed in an encounter by the security forces. Burhan Wani eventually became a poster boy of HM, featuring in several videos and photos posing with weapons and taunting security forces. These were circulated on Facebook and WhatsApp in an attempt to recruit young Kashmiri men. Reportedly his star power helped him to recruit nearly 100 Kashmiri youth. Though before his death there were several campaigns against him, labelling him as an Indian agent till the time he was killed by SOG and 19 RR in a fierce encounter in Kokernag in South Kashmir.

A woman gets raped every 5 hrs in the capital: Delhi Police,"Crime marginally reduced this year in Delhi compared to the last year with only motor vehicle theft registering an increase over the previous year. Latest annual crime data by the Delhi Police shows that cases of molestation (from 5,328 to 4,005) and robbery (from 7,141 to 4,538) showed the maximum dip. However, Delhi reported a rape every four hours in 2016. Compared to last year?s 2,069 rape cases, 2029 were registered this year. Of these, police managed to solve only 1,744 cases.The total cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) ? FIRs registered across Delhi ? increased by 8.88% than last year?s 1.81 lakh to 1.97 lakh this year. Robbery cases registered a sharp decline of 35.45%. Police believe demonetisation of high currency notes could be one of the reasons behind reduction in the robbery cases. Between November 8 and December 9 this year - a month of demonetisation ? there were 315 robbery cases compared to 561 in the same period last year. ?The drop in robbery cases would have been less than 35.45% but because of demonetisation the cases reported a sharp decline since November 8.

The triple murder of a man, his wife and son at their house in central Delhi?s Rajender Nagar on January 10 was one among them. In November, the discovery of three mutilated bodies in 10 days, within a radius of 10 kilometres in south Delhi triggered fears of a serial killer. Police have solved two cases but are yet to make any headway in the third case. The Delhi Police was also surrounded by controversies throughout the year. It began with their decision to book JNU student leaders under the archaic sedition law. It snowballed into a controversy forcing then police commissioner to admit that ?excesses were committed from both sides (police and JNU students).? Facing heat and protests, the police chief also said that cops would not oppose the bail of JNU students, only to retract later. One crime that the police failed to keep bring down this year is the theft of vehicles. As many as 5,250 more vehicles were stolen this year than the last year, taking total such cases to 36,137. Police say they are meeting with their counterparts in Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to bring down the motor vehicle thefts. Prashant Vihar in outer Delhi, which registered the highest snatching cases, topped the list in areas where most vehicles (920) were stolen, followed by Bhajanpura (630).

Of these, 212 students were still on the academic roll as of March 31, 2016, as they failed to compelte their academic exercises, projects and other course work. These included 94 students who were on the roll for more than three years after their courses should have been completed.WHAT THE CAG FOUND1. The institution (FTII) neither has any specific rule to extend the tenure of such students nor any approval for such group extensions were taken from the Academic Council or Governing Council.2. The tution and hostel fees are not charged after the scheduled completion of courses. Hence, the students continued to be on academic roll and in hostels without payment of fees/hostel charges beyond the prescribed tenure of their courses.3. Continuance of a very large number of enrolled students creates additional pressure on the academic and other infrastructure of the institute.4. Of the total revenue loss of Rs 11.83 crore, Rs 2.78 crore due to FTII not charging fees for the extended duration of the courses and Rs 9.05 crore due to non-recovery of hostel fees for overstay.FTII's REPLY Responding to the CAG's findings, the FTII, in a reply on September 2016, admitted that there was a problem of students not completing their course work on time and that the institution does not have a set system of dealing with such situations.The CAG report, however, noted that the FTII students' hand book states that a student has to leave the hostel room and campus after completion of the academic tenure of his/her course.CASCADING EFFECTApart from causing a revenue loss, students overstaying at FTII has also had a cascading effect on fresh admissions, the CAG said. The situation caused the institution to skip fresh admissions in 2010, 2014, 2015.",general,2888,60,70

Diaper that alerts when it needs to be changed developed,"Tokyo, Dec 26 (PTI) Scientists in Japan have developed a new urine-powered sensor that can alert caregivers when a diaper is wet and ready to be changed. A team from the Ritsumeikan University in Japan worked on the diaper for about five years, with the aim of caring for ageing patients suffering from urinary incontinence. Producing a sensor suitable for a diaper proved to be a challenge, researchers said. They first developed a urine sensor too rigid to embed into a diaper. Flexible embeddable battery and sensor contain a chemical potentially unsafe for humans and their charging times varied. The new diaper sensors overcome all of those problems by using a urine-activated battery, Gizmodo reported.",general,709,56,70

Indian jails no less than ones there: India to UK on Mallya,"India has told UK authorities that all wanted Indians, including liquor baron Vijay Mallya, will get equal treatment like any other prisoner in India and the facilities in its jails are no less than what European nations have, a senior official said.This was conveyed by Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi to his British counterpart Patsy Wilkinson, the second permanent secretary in the British Home Office, during a meeting last week in London.The Indian delegation led by Mehrishi told the British authorities that whoever is extradited from the UK, he or she will be lodged in a proper jail with facilities on par with European jails, said the official, who did not want to be quoted.However, the Indian team made it clear that no extradited persons will be given preferential treatment but would be treated like any other prisoner and asked the British authorities to convey this to the court in London.This bears significance as Mallya has challenged the Indian government?s move in the court to get him extradited from the UK saying the conditions in Indian jails are below standard.The Indian delegation told their British counterparts that the cells in Indian jails are bigger than European jails and all jails have medical facilities with a proper hospital, the official said.The home ministry has already written to the Maharashtra government to improve the conditions of its Arthur Road jail, where Mallya would be lodged if extradited from the UK, he said.Mallya, who is wanted in India for Kingfisher Airlines? default on loans worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore, has been in Britain since March, 2016.A court in London is hearing a case regarding his return to India.India has already assured Britain of all assistance in extradition matters to allow the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to present water-tight cases before the courts there against Mallya.Mehrishi visited London in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s talks with his British counterpart Theresa May in Hamburg, on the sidelines of the G20 meeting there recently.Modi had asked for Britain?s cooperation in sending ?economic offenders? back to India.A joint team of the ED and the CBI is currently in London to brief UK prosecution, working on the extradition of Mallya, and to submit fresh proof in the case.The visiting officials of the two central probe agencies will also submit the charge-sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate in the case last month in Mumbai, said a senior official in the probe team.",general,2494,59,70
"China releases map claiming Indian, Bhutanese territory","Stepping up its claims that India had ""trespassed"", China has now released a map showing the site of the stand-off as well as China's territorial claims at the India-China-Bhutan trijunction that are in conflict with India's and Bhutan's claims.The map claims the Indian Army crossed the border at Doka La pass, depicted with a blue arrow, into the Doklam plateau which India and Bhutan see as Bhutanese territory but is claimed by China.The map, released on Friday, also reveals China's substantial territorial claims at the trijunction that are conflicting with India's and Bhutan's. It shows that China fixes the trijunction far south of where India and Bhutan do, which explains the current stand-off.WHAT THE MAP SHOWSThe Chinese trijunction, marked by an arrow that claims it is under the 1890 Britain-China treaty, is at the Mount Gipmochi. This is far south of where India and Bhutan mark the trijunction, which the map acknowledged with a dotted line.The area on the Doklam plateau south of the dotted line is claimed by China, and it is here that Beijing was building a road into what Bhutan sees as its territory, triggering the stand-off with Bhutan and India.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday: ""The line commences at Mount Gipmochi on the Bhutan frontier, and follows the above-mentioned water-parting to the point where it meets Nepal territory. It is without any doubt that the spot where the Indian border troops trespassed is on the Chinese side of the boundary.""INDIA CONCERNED OVER CHINESE INCURSION India, however, on Friday reminded China that building a road in this disputed area was a violation. ""India is deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and has conveyed to the Chinese Government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India,"" the Ministry of External Affairs said.""In this context, the Indian side has underlined that the two Governments had in 2012 reached agreement that the tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries will be finalized in consultation with the concerned countries. Any attempt, therefore, to unilaterally determine tri-junction points is in violation of this understanding. Where the boundary in the Sikkim sector is concerned, India and China had reached an understanding also in 2012 reconfirming their mutual agreement on the ""basis of the alignment"". Further discussions regarding finalization of the boundary have been taking place under the Special Representatives framework.""

I acknowledge very clearly, but have we given them proper sanctity or not?"" Prasad asked at the Mindmine Summit here. He was responding to a question related to development having an impact on culture and diversity. ""We salute diversity and culture of India. There are two ways of looking at it. Let me be very frank today. There has been campaign against us for a very long time, but today we are here because of blessings of people of India,"" Prasad said. In recent Assembly elections, the BJP scored an impressive win in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The party also formed government in Goa and Manipur. Its main rival Congress was able to get a clear majority in Punjab only.

But, on Wednesday, when India Today asked Rajinikanth's contemporary actor and superstar Kamal Haasan on his political aspirations, the answer came as a brutal shock to many.In the interview to India Today's Rajdeep Sardesai, Haasan expressed extreme anger on the rampant corruption in Tamil Nadu politics for the last 60 years and the current uncertainty over leadership between VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam. Here's an excerpt from the conversation:Rajdeep Sardesai: You have been direct. You are making it clear to the people of Tamil Nadu that Mr O Panneerselvam is not incompetent, and should be given a chance. If he is proven incompetent, people can throw him out. In that respect, Sasikala should respect the will of Tamil Nadu rather than imposing her will?Kamal Haasan: Absolutely, even I cannot, with all my connection to television channel, impose my will. I can speak what I think, but can't impose. I may be proven wrong, but I must speak now.Q: Do you believe the people of Tamil Nadu has been ill-served by the political class which needs to recognise the needs and aspirations of the people?A: Let us not get carried away by nostalgia. Tamil Nadu has not had the best of service from politicians for more than 60 years now. The first 10 years were glorious, but Congress..Kamraj-ji, Raja-ji.. they all became complacent. Then came the Dravidian parties. Those promises were also not kept. It's sort of churning into a quagmire now.Q: In this quagmire, at the moment do you the best interest of Tamil Nadu is with Panneerselvam and not Sasikala? That Sasikala, by virtue of the fact that she was close to Jayalalithaa cannot use that as a reason? Do you believe she's not qualified enough to become the chief minister at this point?A: I don't think it is right on the people, I don't know what her qualifications are. Neither do the people. And sticking around somebody for long enough doesn't make you qualified enough for the profession. Am a lawyer's son, that doesn't mean I can go to the court and argue a case. Am an actor. I trained for that. ..The time of dice playing was done with in Mahabharat. We can't be playing dice and hawking our family wives and lives, in favour of some numbers [Sasikala's MLA support]. We don't trade. We are the people.Q: You feel let down today. I see in your voice, a sense of frustration and a sense of almost being betrayed by the political class of Tamil Nadu?A: For how long? I've known betrayal only from the time I have been a boy. And one reason for another is not big enough for me. They keep saying, this is the reason, we could have done it, that's not good enough reason. Show me results, show me roads, clean my rivers. You have done nothing. We have two gutters running around Chennai, we started with rivers a 100 years back. Starting from simple sanitation.Q: Do you believe that because of what you call the conglomeration of corruption, the politicians of Tamil Nadu have distanced themselves from people and people's issues.A: Absolutely. It happened to the Congress when they thought they got the freedom for the country, and people as if they owe each other something. It's not true. Results are to be seen for us let them continue. We could have done so many things with just 5 years years you promised. We wasted half a century and more on improving a state. If this is just the state of a state, what have we done to the country?Q: I sense in you a potential budding politician. You say only do politics till they put a black ink on your finger. But in this anger and frustration, I sense someone who could become a politician if you chose to? Given the filmstar politicians - the MGRs, NTRs, would the Kamal Haasan name be ever added to that list?",general,3858,60,70

World's largest aircraft completes test flight,"London, May 23 (PTI) The worlds largest aircraft has successfully completed a test flight, bringing the massive helium-filled airship one step closer to commercial use.

With a length of 92 metres, it is the largest aircraft currently flying, Live Science reported. On May 10, the Airlander 10 flew for a total of 180 minutes to test the aircrafts handling, improved landing technology and more, according to Hybrid Air Vehicles, the British company that built the aircraft.

"Mayweather calls McGregor racist, uses homophobic slur","Floyd Mayweather attacked Conor McGregor with a homophobic slur and accused the UFC fighter of racism in the final leg of a promotional tour that has descended into an ugly war of words. The UFC lightweight champion was again forced to defend himself against allegations of racism as Mayweather rounded on him at a heated press call in front of 10,000 fans at Wembley Arena.?Racism still exists. It?s all about treating people like you want to be treated. To get respect you must give respect,? said Mayweather, who then called McGregor a ?faggot? on stage.?He totally disrespected black women. He called black people monkeys. Then he spoke disrespectfully to my mother and my daughter. There are certain levels you don?t stoop to and certain levels you just don?t go to. I love everybody from all walks of life.?Claims of racism against McGregor were first levelled during the opening two legs of the four-date journey through North America and Europe to generate publicity for their August 26 clash. McGregor told Mayweather ?dance for me, boy? ? a phrase with racial overtones. In New York, the UFC lightweight champion had only inflamed the issue, saying he was ?half-black from the belly button down? before appearing to refer to black people as ?dancing monkeys? when discussing the film Rocky III on a chat show.Irishman McGregor, who has predicted he will win inside four rounds despite never having previously boxed as a professional, vehemently denied being a racist.?You can be fooled by [Mayweather] if you want to be fooled by him. You know the man?s character and his history. He?s trying to sway people in his favour and it?s a cheap move,? McGregor said. ?I was trying to address something in my own little way but whatever, if he feels it?s disrespectful then he?s an idiot and fuck him as well. It?s a dirty play. I think [the accusation] is ridiculous. I don?t understand it. I know who I am as a person and I think that most realistic people will look at me and know who I am.?Cheered on by supporters whose spirits were not dampened by a near-two-hour delay, McGregor goaded the 40-year-old Mayweather with taunts about his age, appearance and rumoured tax bill.He remarked that four years ago he had fought in front of only 400 people at a small venue in London, adding ?this is my first time in a boxing ring and in six weeks I?ll rule boxing?.Mayweather was booed as soon as he took the microphone and endured a hostile reception from the pro-McGregor crowd throughout his performance.?The tour became a verbal battle that people were scoring and I didn?t anticipate it being so back and forth,? McGregor said.?If we are going to score it then let?s do that ? I smoked him on all four rounds.?While the money generated by the clash in Las Vegas is expected to eclipse the previous record held by Mayweather?s victory over Manny Pacquiao, its credibility has been questioned.McGregor, who turned 29 on Friday, is a boxing novice and is facing a man regarded as the finest boxer of his generation.?They call that jealousy. It comes with the territory. This is big for both MMA and the boxing world. This is huge,? Mayweather said.?Every MMA guy is trying to fight a boxer. A fight like this can only happen once in a lifetime. This is a very, very big event. It took more than just myself to make this fight happen, but to make a fight of this magnitude happen I had to be involved.?",general,3405,54,70
"I didn't want this job, wife made me do it: US State Secy","Rex Tillerson has said he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it.The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis). ?I didn?t want this job. I didn?t seek this job,? Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. ?My wife told me I?m supposed to do this.?He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company CEO.?When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: ?I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?I told you God?s not through with you.?He said he now feels his wife had been right: ?I?m supposed to do this.?Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries.He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: ?I?m not a big media press access person. I personally don?t need it. I understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but I also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: ?He was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment.?Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?We haven?t gotten that far yet.?While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because I was tired,? he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers? meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump?s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting.",general,4528,57,70

SC bans sale of BS-III compliant vehicles from April 1,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday banned the sale and registration of Bharat Stage (BS)-III emission norm-compliant vehicles from April 1, saying the health of millions was more important than commercial interests.The decision could deal a Rs 12,000-crore blow to auto manufactures as about 820,000 vehicles, most of them two-wheelers, are lying unsold.India will switch to the more efficient and stringent BS-IV norms, already in place in some parts of the country, including Delhi, from April 1.?The number of such vehicles may be small compared to the overall number of vehicles in the country but the health of the people is far, far more important than the commercial interests of the manufacturers,? a bench of justice Madan B Lokur and justice Deepak Gupta said, rejecting the plea of automobile firms for time to dispose of BS-III vehicles.The court, which has passed several orders to check pollution, said the manufacturers were aware that from April 1 they would be required to manufacture only BS-IV vehicles but they failed to take sufficient pro-active steps.The ruling came on a plea by the environment pollution control authority (Epca), which petitioned the court that only BS-IV vehicles should be sold in the market. Most automobile companies except Bajaj opposed the plea.The objective behind a cleaner fuel technology would not be achieved if older vehicles continue to flood the market, said Epca, a Supreme-court appointed autonomous body that advises government on ecological issues.The court also rejected the Centre?s argument that the BS-IV rollout only banned manufacturing and not the sale of the BS-III vehicles.Setback to car companies. SC restrains them from selling BS-3 vehicles from April 1 @htTweets? bhadra sinha (@BhadraSinha) March 29, 2017The biggest difference between the two is the emission of carbon particulate matter, a major air pollutant. While BS-III vehicles emit 2.30gm of carbon monoxide per kg of fuel, the emission drops to 1gm per kg in BS-IV vehicles.Transition to BS-IV could lead to a substantial drop in particulate matter emissions. For instance, new trucks could see an 80% drop in emissions and cars by 50%, Epca told the court.Similarly, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions ? a big concern for two-wheelers ? could drop between 41 and 80%, depending on the engine size, it said. The norms have to be followed by auto makers as well as fuel companies. The solicitor general told the court that BS-IV fuel would be available across India from April 1.Industry would abide by the order, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) president Vinod K Dasari said. The industry had been ready with BS-IV manufacturing since 2010 but the sale of these vehicles was not possible nationwide due to lack of BS-IV fuel, Dasari said. India has set a deadline of 2020 to switch to BS-VI norms, giving a miss to stage V. But the leap, which will include technology upgrade, will make vehicles pricier ? petrol cars by Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 and diesel ones could cost up to Rs 1 lakh more.",general,3050,54,70
"Be vegetarian, no cricket during family time: RSS on values","What to eat, what to wear, how to celebrate birthdays and advice on public conduct -- all this is part of the RSS? family counselling programme launched in?April. The pan-India campaign involves visiting people?s homes to ?instill values and ethics? apart from advocating vegetarianism and promoting Indian attire. Named Kutumb Prabodhan (family counselling), the campaign will continue till the 2019 general elections. The move comes amid widespread outrage and anger over mob violence in the name of the cow, considered holy by many Hindus.RSS insiders said senior swayamsevaks, along with one or two swayamsevaks and a Rashtra Sevika Sangh (RSS? women?s wing) worker, visit families and ?educate? them on the benefits of vegetarianism and how to avoid being influenced by foreign culture, especially as shown by various television channels and social media portals.One such group led by RSS leader Ashok Bhatt, the Vidarbha convener of Kutumb Prabodhan, visited the family of Suresh Deshpande in Nagpur?s Sadar locality last week. The team advised them to wear sarees and kurta-pyjamas during festivals and told them celebrating birthdays by blowing candles and cutting cakes was not a part of the Indian culture.The Deshpandes, a family of four, were told about traditional Hindu practices such as chanting mantras before meals. They said all the family members must eat together at least once a week and should not watch television at the time, instead bond with each other. During their family time, they should avoid discussing politics and cricket. Besides, every person must respect women, fight casteism, and inculcate the habit of reading good books that feed one?s intellect. The Deshpandes were told to take up social work.?The RSS team enquired about our food habits, favourite TV channels and shows, how we celebrate birthday and our preference of attire,? said Suresh.He said the talk was a good concept aimed at strengthening the bond between family members. ?Besides, through the interaction we could understand the problems faced by our children and other members of the family,? said Sunita, Suresh?s wife. Bhatt said they have been getting a good response.?We are also asking the families to sit together at least once a week to help to create bonhomie and strengthen ties among the members,? he said.Atul Pingle, a senior RSS leader and Vidarbha Prant Pracharak Pramukh, said such an initiative was the need of the hour when people were becoming more materialistic and self-centred.?We will also visit the families of minorities like Muslims and Christians,? said Pingle, adding the campaign would help restore harmony, friendship and community bond among people.The Kutumb Prabodhan campaign is a major initiative of the RSS, the ideological mentor of the ruling BJP, after its pet project of ?one temple, one crematorium and one well for all in each village? that was launched last year across the country on Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar?s 125th birth anniversary in an effort to propagate social equality and harmony. The project was appreciated by noted industrialist Ratan Tata when he met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur last year.Political observers feel that such ventures would give the swayamsevaks a direct access to families and reap dividends for the BJP in the ensuing elections.",politics,3312,59,70

It gives an opportunity to do an informed critique of the text,? said Sanam Khanna, who teaches English at DU.Sachin N, who teaches English at Dyal Singh College, said, ?The way these modifications have been done has limited or no participation from teachers. There is no framework on how we are supposed to teach the popular fiction paper. The core committee has no statutory recognition.

523 wetlands destroyed in Maharashtra in 5 years: Report,"A court order protecting them and several reports pointing out their importance notwithstanding, wetlands across the state continue to be destroyed. Between 2012 and 2017 alone, 523 cases of wetland destruction were reported, a report compiled by the Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti revealed at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa, on Thursday. Ten major cases were reported from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, but the most cases were reported in Thane, at Kalher, Kasheli and Dombivli among other areas. In Mumbai, the destruction is taking place right under our noses ? a 400-acre patch opposite Millat Nagar in Oshiwara-Lonkhandwala, a 15-acre patch at Shivaji Nagar, a 200 acre patch in Charkop and a 10-acre patch in Dahisar.Why does this matter to you? Wetlands are areas of land covered by water, and apart from being home to several species of plants and animals, they act as a carbon sink by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and cleaning the air you breathe.READ: Maharashtra government order to save wetlands: List those larger than 2.25ha by September?More than 500 wetland destruction cases were reported in five years. This couldn?t have been possible if not for active support from government machinery such as police and revenue department,? said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti. ?The state mangrove cell, meanwhile, has managed to keep the wetlands under their control, relatively safe.?In 2014, the Bombay HC banned reclamation and construction on wetlands after Vanashakti filed a PIL to protect them. Stalin said even during the wetland grievance redressal committee meetings (formed by the state as per HC directions), corporations and revenue departments refused to restore degraded wetlands citing poor funds and lack of places to dump debris from wetlands. ?Despite several court orders, municipal corporations in Mumbai, Thane, Mira Bhayander and Vasai are ignorant about conserving wetlands,? Stalin said. According to the national wetland atlas developed by the Union environment ministry, Maharashtra (spread across 3.07 lakh sqkm) has a wetland cover of just 10,145 sqkm . The Vanashakti data comes a week after HT reported the state had directed every district to document wetlands larger than 2.25 hectares by September, to protect them. Before this directive, the state mapped 320 wetlands in forest areas across 25 districts . Beefing up security and tightening laws were the only ways to protect wetlands, experts said. ?Wetland destruction is a much larger violation than just destroying mangroves, which are a part of wetlands. The state needs to levy stricter fines and soon,? said Arvind Untawale, executive secretary of the Mangrove Society of India. ?The Vanashakti report is an eye-opener to the massive loss already incurred by the state.?Konkan commissioner Jagdish Patil told HT, ?We are drafting an action plan to protect these sites better.

Earlier today, the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation issued a notice on the matter, asking 500 resident doctors in Mumbai to resume work or face disciplinary action. The notice warned the doctors that if they fail to resume work, then they could be expelled and their medical registrations could be canceled, as per a January 31, 1996 Government Resolution.Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association's Maharashtra chapter has lent its support to the physicians, expressing 'deep pain' at the ""recent spate of events of unabated violence against doctors.""A letter signed by IMA Maharashtra State's president Dr Ashok Tambe and honorary state secretary Dr Parthiv Sanghvi says, ""We are unable to understand the apathy on the part of the government in not providing an atmosphere free from fear.""""We oppose any action taken against resident doctors and will work to all extents to ensure that they are not victimised.""Dr Sagar, an advisor to the IMA, said they don't want assurances but actual on-the-ground action. ""We need more security at OPDs, in emergency wards and operation theaters,"" he added.",health,1747,58,70
Indian guilty of using fake identity to get US citizenship,"An Indian man, who was ordered deported, has been convicted for using fake identity to obtain American citizenship, an acting US attorney has said.Balbir Singh aka Ranjit Singh, 50, faces up to 10 years in federal prison, a maximum $250,000 possible fine, revocation of his citizenship and enforcement of his outstanding deportation order.According to acting US attorney Abe Martinez, Balbir Singh had previously attempted to obtain asylum under false pretences. When that attempt failed, an immigration judge then ordered his deportation from the US, thus making him ineligible to ever become a naturalised citizen.A resident of Houston, Singh, instead of leaving the country, changed his name, date of birth, the manner in which he entered the US and his familial history so that he could obtain lawful immigration status, and later naturalisation, based on a marriage to a US citizen.In the process of obtaining the citizenship, he denied ever being ordered deported, seeking asylum or using a different identity. ?In addition, Singh sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2013. In it, he complained about the anxiety and frustration he experienced in having to wait for an extended period at the airport every time he returned from an international trip due to discrepancies in his biometric information. He requested DHS clear these discrepancies,? the Justice Department said.After obtaining the citizenship, a fingerprint comparison established the man previously ordered deported from the US (Balbir Singh) and the man who later became a naturalised citizen (Ranjit Singh) were one and the same.Accepting the plea, US district judge Ewing Werlein set sentencing for October 13.",world,1708,58,70

217 farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra in June,"At least 217 farmers have ended their in the month following chief minister Devendra Fadnavis? farm loan waiver announcement on June 2 this year. This numbers for the month of June equal the average monthly figures in the past six months. According to figures of the suicides collated by the relief and rehabilitation department, 79 farmers in Marathwada and 87 in Vidarbha ended their lives in June. A month earlier, 89 and 90 farmers had committed suicides respectively in these two regions, which are worst-affected by the agrarian crisis. The number of suicides has now shot up to 1,327 this year. The number has, however, dropped when compared to the same time period last year. In June 2016, the total number of cases had reached 1,541 in the first six months.Experts said this was expected and the loan wavier is not the solution. ?87% of the suicides take place in the families that are completely dependent on farming. A waiver cannot prove to be a respite to avert them from committing suicides because they are going to be indebted again. The government should first amend laws related to the farmers if they want marginal farmers to survive. I don?t think the suicides will stop even after the actual disbursement of the waiver amount,? said farm activist Amar Habib.",general,1283,52,70

"Advani, Joshi agree to face charges in Babri mosque case","Veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi have agreed to face conspiracy charges in Babri mosque demolition case even as the Supreme Court reserved its verdict today. Hearing a petition filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the top court said it was ready for day-to-day hearing in the case after the central investigation agency pleaded the court that conspiracy charges against top BJP leaders, including Advani, Joshi, Union Minister Uma Bharti be revived. Senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for the BJP leaders, told the Supreme Court that his clients were ready to face conspiracy charges if the CBI can adduce evidence against them in Raebareli. ""Why should my right to appeal be taken to a sessions court,"" Venugopal said. The CBI had booked several BJP leaders including Advani, Joshi, Uma Bharti, Kalyan Singh and Vinay Katiyar but they were freed by a court in Raebareli of conspiracy charges. In 2010, the Allahabad High Court confirmed this decision.The Supreme Court while hinting ordering day-to-day hearing in the case said that it may transfer the trial to Lucknow. ""It's in cases like these where over 17 years have passed since the high court.The question is whether we permit evasion of law (on technical grounds) or allow evasion of justice,"" the top court observed.On March 6, the apex court had decided to examine the appeal against dropping of conspiracy charge against the accused including Advani, Joshi and Uma Bharti in the case related to demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992.The top court had also came up with an option of ordering a joint trial of cases arising out of the two FIRs lodged in the wake of the demolition of the disputed structure.However, the clubbing of two FIRs was opposed by the counsel for the accused on the ground that there were different sets of persons named as accused in the two cases, the trial of which were at an advanced stage at two different places.Altogether, 13 persons including Advani, Joshi and Bharti were discharged of conspiracy charge in the case, the trial of which is being held at a special court in Raebareli.The second set of case was against unknown 'karsevaks' who were in and around the disputed structure and the trial was being held at a court in Lucknow.The appeals were filed by the CBI against dropping of conspiracy charges against Advani, Joshi and 19 others for demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992.

Maha to pay farmers ?2.43 cr per acre for land acquisition,"In a move to stem farmers? protests against land acquisition for the ambitious Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway, the state government seems to have opened its purse strings. This week, the Thane district collectorate finalised land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka, which is the highest compensation paid to farmers in Maharashtra for a public project,so far. Farmers from Khardi village in Shahapur taluka stand to get Rs 2.43 crore for an acre of land under this project. The ready reckoner rate for this village for every hectare of land is around Rs29.59 lakh ( Around 2.4 acres make one hectare of land).The compensation for the 23 villages in this taluka, which will lose land to the 706-km highway, ranges from Rs52.16 lakh to Rs5.84 crore for an hectare for land. This works out to Rs21.66 lakh to Rs2.43 crore for an acre of land. A copy of the land rates announced for every village per hectare is with HT. After Khardi, farmers from villages like Dalkhan, Birwadi and Kasara will get a generous compensation of around Rs74.84 lakh and Rs68.93 lakh for an acre of land. This is a one-time compensation that will be paid to farmers if they opt for direct settlement with the state government. Read:?Congress and Shiv Sena up the ante against Maharashtra government for blanket loan waiverGiven the wide range, however, not all farmers will be happy with the rates announced. So far, the compensation given to farmers for the Shendre-Bidkin industrial park near Aurangabad under the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor for nearly Rs23 lakh an acre was being considered as one of highest payouts for farm land. (In the case of DMIC, however, separate compensation was also given for orchards).Thane district collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar confirmed the final land rates for farm land in Shahapur taluka.?We are trying to offer the highest land rate possible for every district affected by the project. It?s history in making,?? said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The compensation for non-agriculture land in Shahapur taluka is even higher, in some cases as high as Rs12.60 crore to Rs18.11 crore for an acre of such land in Khardi and Kasara villages. However, only 10 to 15% of non-agricultural land comes under the highway, with officials claiming these rates could get revised as they seemed exorbitant. The proposed eight-lane highway, which will run across 10 districts to link Nagpur to Thane, is facing stiff opposition from farmers over land acquisition. In a bid to tone down these protests, the government is offering competitive land rates to woo the farmers. The land rates are being worked out by committees appointed for every district led by the collector that considers a variety of parameters including ready reckoner rate of every village, average of last three years of sale deeds, the number of land transactions, compensation as per Land Acquisition law etc, 25 per cent more incentive offered by the state for direct sale.Read: Maharashtra farmer complains against IMD for ?wrong? rain forecastLast week, Nasik district collector had announced land rates for the district in the range of Rs40 lakh to Rs80 lakh for one hectare of land. But this had only intensified protests against the project with farmers from Nasik, not wooed by the compensation offered for their irrigated lands.?We have considered a variety of factors and the rates get jacked up also by the number of land transactions that have taken place in that village. In Khardi, for instance, in the recent past, we noted nearly 500 land sale deeds. This was comparatively far less in Chande village that has among the lowest compensations in Shahapur,?? said a Thane district collectorate official.The Thane collectorate has also worked out rates for Kalyan taluka, which are far lower than Shahapur, with the highest compensation being Rs1.50 crore for an hectare of land or Rs62 lakh for an acre of land. The lowest compensation here is around Rs61.14 lakh for an hectare of land or Rs25.47 lakh for an acre of land.The district administration may revise the land rates for Kalyan taluka given that farmers are likely to react negatively given the high rates offered in neighbouring Shahapur taluka.",general,4216,58,70

Saudi using Canadian equipment against citizens: Reports,"The Canadian government is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia is using armoured vehicles made in Canada against its own civilians ? allegations that have prompted renewed scrutiny over Ottawa?s recent decision to sign off on a billion-dollar arms deal with the kingdom.Videos and photos posted on social media in recent days allegedly show Riyadh using Canadian equipment in a violent crackdown on minority Shia dissidents in eastern Saudi Arabia. Last week at least five people were killed as security forces flushed out suspected militants in the town of Awamiya. Several sources told the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail that the vehicles being used appeared to be Gurkha RPVs made in Ontario by Terradyne Armoured Vehicles. Canadian officials said they were deeply concerned by the reports. ?We are looking at these claims very seriously ? and have immediately launched a review,? Justin Trudeau told reporters. In 2016, Saudi Arabia ranked among the largest importers of Canada-made military goods, purchasing more than C$142m worth of goods ? nearly 20% of all Canadian military exports that year.The ministry of global affairs said it was concerned over the escalating violence in eastern Saudi Arabia. In a statement issued last week, it highlighted the causalities among civilians and security forces and urged Riyadh to confront its security challenges in ?a manner that abides by international human rights law?.Days later, the ministry said the government was actively seeking more information about the reports of civilian casualties and claims that Canadian-made vehicles were involved. ?If it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights, the minister will take action,? a spokesperson for department told the Guardian. He did not answer questions around what kinds of actions this could entail. Terradyne Armoured Vehicles did not respond to a request for comment. The allegations have prompted renewed calls for Trudeau?s Liberal government to scrap a recent decision to push forward with a 15-year contract to supply Saudi Arabia with weaponised armoured vehicles made by General Dynamics, another Ontario-based company. Critics say the C$15bn deal, struck in 2014 by the previous conservative government, could see the vehicles ? which are equipped with machine guns ? used by the Saudis to crush dissent at home. Others have pointed to Canadian rules that restrict arms exports to countries with poor human rights records and prohibit exports if there is a possibility that the buyer could use the arms against its own population. Despite these concerns, Trudeau?s Liberal government signed off on the export permits in 2016. Trudeau has since defended the decision, arguing that Canada would be seen as a ?banana republic? if it scrapped the deal. ?People have to know that when you sign a deal with Canada, a change in governments won?t immediately scrap the jobs and benefits coming from it,? the prime minister told the Toronto Star last year. The deal would reportedly create around 3,000 jobs in Canada. Amid escalating concerns over human rights, countries such as Germany and Belgium have in recent years denied export applications for arms headed to Saudi Arabia. In 2015, Sweden cancelled a longstanding defence agreement with the Saudis, citing similar concerns. This month, a high court in London ruled that the UK could proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. ?Saudi Arabia has been, and remains, genuinely committed to compliance with International Humanitarian Law; and there was no ?real risk? that there might be ?serious violations? of International Humanitarian Law (in its various manifestations) such that UK arm sales to Saudi Arabia should be suspended or cancelled,? the court said. Campaigners called the ruling a ?green light? for the UK to sell arms to ?brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers?.In Canada, Amnesty International pointed to the indications that Canadian vehicles are being used against civilians to call on the Liberal government to reverse its support of the billion-dollar arms deal.?Mounting tensions and conflict in eastern Saudi Arabia, about which the Canadian government has rightly expressed public concern, further indicate how fraught it is for Canada to have authorised the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia at this time,? secretary-general Alex Neve said in a statement.",world,4422,56,70
"Lizards' genitals sold to enhance sex, racket busted in MP","There is a new entry in the bizarre world of illegal wildlife trade in India. Enforcement agencies have discovered that now the big monitor lizard (genus Varanus) - found across deserts, forests and coastlines of the country - is being poached for its hemipenis (sexual organ), which is sold as a lucky charm for virility and fertility in men. Because of its forked appearance, it is called ""hatha jodi"". This is often used to confuse customers with the popular Ayurvedic plant ""hath jod"", which serves to mend bone fractures. The Madhya Pradesh special task Force (MPSTF) seized 68 pieces of the tiny reptile body part from four poachers in raids in Indore and Khargone from June 16-17. One of those arrested was a priest of the famous Navagraha temple of Khargone, who was found in possession of 13 hatha jodi. ""This also points towards the artificially created religious beliefs around hatha jodi,"" said RP Singh, additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) of MP. Many pieces have been found smeared with vermillion around temples in the past few days. Three traders - Sumit Sharma, Sachin Sharma and Feroze Ali - were nabbed from Indore with 10 pieces of the contraband. Lokesh Jagirdar, the Navagraha temple priest, was also arrested on June 16. On Saturday, following clues given by them, their supplier, Rajesh Porwal, was taken into custody from Indore. Officers said the items were most probably procured from western MP or the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, where the stony and desert topography harbours large populations of the lizard. Each piece was being sold for anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 15,000 depending on how naive or desperate the buyer is. ""So many false pretexts are given, ranging from boosted sex life to success in lucky draws and gambling and prosperity in business. Unfortunately, with increasing prosperity in towns like Ujjain, Indore and Ratlam, people are willing to shell out the money as well,"" Singh said.SEX SELLS AND SO DO GENITALSDr Sumit Dookia, herpetologist and professor at Delhi's Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said, ""India has four varieties of these reptiles - Bengal, Yellow, Desert and Water Monitor Lizard. Their habitat is distributed across the middle Himalayas to Western Ghats. They are expert terrestrial animals as well as great swimmers."" ""Notably, they serve an important role in the ecosystem as scavengers, eating up the flesh of dead animals alongside eggs, insects, small birds and animals. Any downfall in their numbers is unhealthy for the ecosystem,"" he added. They are a Schedule 1 species as per India's Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) prohibits trade in the Bengal Monitor Lizard. Additional Director of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Tilottama Verma, informed, ""Previously, we had found 210 hatha jodis in Brahmeswarpatna area of Odisha on May 30. And 22 such pieces were confiscated in Hyderabad in March, taking the confirmed number of big lizards killed for their genitals to 300 at least. Some such items were seized in Chennai too."" ""We have long known monitor lizards to be killed sporadically for their meat, fat and oil, consumed in mostly some tribal areas. But hatha jodis certainly came as a surprise to us. We sent them to various scientific labs to ascertain their true origin,"" he added. The items are also being sold online, even on big global e-tail firms. ""We had launched Operation Wildnet to get hold of such unscrupulous elements a few months back, which has so far been successful.

Their relationship came in the spotlight when they made an entry together at Akshay Kumar's Rustom success bash.However, neither of them has openly admitted to being together. When Sonam asked on Koffee with Karan about the ""conjecture"" that she has been dating a ""business-boy from London,"" she laughed, ""I am always dating a businessman from London."" She went on to say that she likes to keep her private life private and she will never talk about it.",general,1168,60,70

Akshay Kumar's 'Jolly LLB 2' hits the theatres,"Jolly LLB 2, starring Akshay Kumar and Huma Qureshi in the lead roles, is the big Bollywood release this week. Will the sequel to Jolly LLB match up to the first film? Here is our Jolly LLB 2 movie review.Jolly LLB 2 Cast: Akshay Kumar, Huma Qureshi, Annu Kapoor, Saurabh ShuklaJolly LLB 2 Director: Subhash KapoorJolly LLB 2 Rating: (3.5/5)Jolly LLB was a jolly good movie. A little film by Subhash Kapoor, Jolly LLB was shouldered by actors like Arshad Warsi and Saurabh Shukla. Actors, not stars. So when a second film in the franchise is announced, and an Akshay Kumar is attached along with it, it sort of brings about mixed feelings in people. On the one hand, while a star comes with expectations along, there's somewhere a shred of regret at seeing yet another tiny film being hijacked by a star. But Kumar doesn't let his stardom overshadow his performance.In the courtroom drama called Jolly LLB 2, Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly (Akshay Kumar) is the lead actor. Jolly LLB 2 is generously peppered with one-liners that deserve to be repeated. Most of these high-voltage lines are mouthed by the film's pivot, Justice Sunderlal Tripathi (an inimitable Saurabh Shukla). Shukla brings his humour and straight-faced dialogue-delivery from the first Jolly LLB, including slight references to it. However, this is a different courtroom. This is Lucknow and you're told ""Muskuraiye, Aap Lucknow mein hain,"" even as goons blow bullets through your brains.Jolly moves out of the shadow of his employer Rizvi Sa'ab and opens his own chamber. He takes money from a heavily pregnant client (Hina, played by Sayani Gupta), looking for justice for the death of her husband. Jolly lands right in the middle of a tragedy in the process. Nightmares rob him of sleep and he decides to file a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) and begins fighting the case.His adversary in this Lucknow court is big-shot advocate Mathur (Annu Kapoor). Mathur symbolises all your lawyers who are driven to nondescript courts in flashy red Range Rovers. The intimidating, rich lawyer vs the underdog. You get the drift.ALSO READ: Bombay High Court orders deletion of four scenes from Akshay Kumar's Jolly LLB 2At its core, Jolly LLB 2 is the story of the condition of courts in the country, much like its predecessor. Akshay Kumar is the driving force of this drama. Director Subhash Kapoor doesn't do enough to extract the best of Akshay's comic timing. But there are enough to get by. Saurabh Shukla's dialogues make you break into a laugh every now and then. The man steals the show.Jolly LLB 2 feels stretched at times. It is a crowd-pleaser alright, but director Subhash Kapoor goes overboard with melodrama at certain points in the film. The film could have been a lot tighter and streamlined had the filmmaker concentrated on just the case. But no. It is an Akshay Kumar film. So you HAVE to have Akshay Kumar delivering lectures on patriotism in the courtroom. You have to have Akshay Kumar taking bullets on duty. You have to have Akshay Kumar breaking into song and dance at the drop of a hat, right when he's out of the hospital, ad nauseum. Well, you do need the whistles for Kumar too.WATCH | Jolly LLB 2 Movie Review: Akshay Kumar is fabulous in this dramaJolly LLB 2 leaves you with a strong sense of deja vu. Annu Kapoor is among the weaker points of the film. Kapoor's character is tolerable to a certain point before saturation hits you like a bus. Huma Qureshi doesn't have much to do in Jolly LLB 2. The supporting cast is chosen well.The charm of this film lies in the details. Scenes like Saurabh Shukla discussing his daughter's wedding lehenga on the mobile in front of a board asking people to not use mobiles inside the courtroom are brilliant. There are little things here and there that are extraordinarily done. The music is not impactful. Jolly LLB 2 would have been the same even without the numerous songs.The paan and people of Lucknow are captured well on camera. Kudos to Subhash Kapoor for making his Jolly LLB 2 on a believable plot. These are all real cases we have seen, heard of, grown up with. From references to Sunny Deol to what actually goes on inside a courtroom, Jolly LLB 2 has it all.",entertainment,4203,46,70

Lawyer behind Kasab's mercy plea now seeks mercy for Jadhav,"Bombay High Court senior lawyer Yug Chaudhry has written a petition addressed to the President of Pakistan seeking mercy for former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav who has been awarded capital punishment by a military court of the country. Chaudhry is known for taking up cases where the neglected people from lower strata of the society have been victims of law enforcement agencies or government apathy.This is not the first mercy petition filed by Chaudhry. In October 2012, he filed a similar petition seeking mercy for Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab who was awarded capital punishment by various courts of India. There were around 202 signatories who signed the petition which was then addressed to President of India. Chaudhry has once again appealed to the same signatories and some others to join him in seeking mercy for Jadhav.In the petition he says, ""We, the undersigned citizens of India, had hitherto by our petition dated 28th October 2012, pleaded with the President of India for granting mercy to Md. Ajmal Kasab, a citizen of Pakistan sentenced to death by the Indian courts for his role in the 26/11 attacks on the city of Mumbai. We now appeal to you, Your Excellency, to exercise your power of clemency in favour of an Indian citizen, Kulbhushan Jadhav, and to spare his life."" The petition further reads, ""We believe that it is wrong and immoral to kill a human being by way of revenge or punishment. Executing Kulbhushan Jadhav in the name of the citizens of Pakistan will only feed a base blood lust that will make our people more blood-thirsty, vengeful and violent.""""We believe that all of us - the best and the worst - are in need of mercy, and it is only by showing mercy that, morally, we ourselves become entitled to receiving it. Bereft of mercy, society becomes impoverished and inhuman. If we have to become a more humane and compassionate society, and leave a better, and less blood-thirsty world behind for our children, we have to curb our instinct for bloody retribution and abandon the practice of killing those who have hurt us"" says Chaudhry in the petition seeking clemency for Jadhav. The petition finally concludes saying, ""In a country whose people believe in the Koran which exalts compassion as the foremost virtue, let it not be said that there is no place left in people's hearts for mercy or that the national conscience can only be satisfied by the killing of Kulbhushan Jadhav"".The signatories who had earlier signed the petition include prominent journalists and social workers from Mumbai and other parts of the country.Also Read:Kulbhushan Jadhav, not the first Indian to be tried and condemned to death by Pakistan",general,2677,59,70

The pictures of the trains led to speculation that the two rakes came face-to-face and a head-on collision was averted but MMRDA authorities denied reports that two monorail trains nearly crashed. UPS Madan, MMRDA Chief said, ""One Monorail rake lost power before it could reach the Chembur station, due to which we had to send another to rake to push it so that the rake could reach Chembur station. The rumours of collision or any rescue of passengers who got stuck are completely false"".The Mumbai monorail, the first such service in the country, was inaugurated in 2014 and runs a 8.93-km-long route between Chembur and Wadala.Also Read:Uttar Pradesh: Satyagarh Express hits goods train near Sitapur, 5 people injured",general,1166,57,70

(Also read: Michel Platini lashes out at Sepp Blatter)In a statement, FIFA said that more than 2.5 million documents were reviewed during the investigation and that the report it shared with Swiss authorities ran to 1,300 pages and included more than 20,000 pages of ""exhibits"", or documentation.The investigation began after several dozen soccer officials, mainly from Latin America, were indicted in the United States in 2015 on corruption-related charges, sparking the worst crisis in FIFA's 113-year history.Some of the suspects have pleaded guilty and await sentencing, others face trial and some are in their native countries where they are fighting, or have avoided, extradition.FIFA said its report would also be made available to U.S. investigators.In Switzerland, the attorney general's office has begun criminal proceedings against Blatter and former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke on suspicion of offences including criminal mismanagement""FIFA is committed to conducting a thorough and comprehensive investigation of the facts so we could hold wrongdoers within football accountable and cooperate with the authorities,"" Infantino said in the FIFA statement.Swiss prosecutors ""will continue to pursue those who enriched themselves and abused their positions of trust in football"", he added.WATCH SPORTS WRAPThe statement from Zurich-based FIFA gave no further details and said that, because of the criminal inquiries under way, it was ""legally restricted from releasing or commenting on the findings from its internal investigation"".The Swiss Attorney General's office confirmed in a statement that it had received the report and said it ""appreciates the preliminary exchange of information and FIFAâ??s close and consistent cooperation"".",general,2199,60,70
Govt transfers over 300 I-T commissioners across the country,"Over 300 commissioners of the Income Tax department have been transferred recently by the government, a major reshuffle seen as an attempt to fine tune the working of the department.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which frames policy for the tax department, has recently brought out two lists ? first transferring 80 and subsequently 245 commissioner rank officials across the country.Just few days before this, on May 31, the CBDT also transferred over 50 chief commissioners of the department across the country.A senior department official said these three lists in quick intervals can be billed as the largest scale of transfers done in the department in the last few years.?The 245 commissioners transfer list published recently is the largest amongst the three lists. Such huge numbers were never heard of, even as the lists have come during the usual transfers season due every year. The aim is to ensure better work productivity and transparency in the department which has a large public interface,? he said.The task of the commissioners and chief commissioners rank officials in the I-T department is largely supervisory, but is very crucial in ensuring the quality and efficacy of the tax collection, assessment, investigation and other aspects under the direct taxes charter.The transfer lists have been personally vetted by CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra who, in the past, has written regular letters to his senior officials to ensure ?preventive vigilance? in the department and effective check on work conduct.The transferred officers, the official said, have been asked to join their new charges in short time as the CBDT wants to initiate a number of new taxpayer friendly measures.It also wants to give continuity to the ongoing drive like nabbing those who generated black money post demonetisation and the job of widening the tax base by identifying those who can pay income tax but are not doing so at present, the official added.",business,1960,60,70
Rotten system needs to be changed: Rajinikanth on politics,"""Will he or won't?"" is the million dollar question in the minds of common men in Tamil Nadu over speculations that superstar Rajinikanth is taking the political plunge. Dropping what is perhaps his biggest hint so far on joining politics, Thalaiva today said the ""system is rotten and needs revamp"".""We have good leaders like Stalin (MK), Anbumani (Ramadoss) and Seeman. But what do we do when the system is rotten, democracy has deteriorated. This system needs to be changed and a change has to be brought in the minds of people, then only will the country flourish,"" he said.""I have my profession, my job. I have some responsibilities and you have your jobs. Go back to your respective places and do your job. Let's meet when it's time for the war,"" Rajinikanth roared amidst thundering applause from fans.Shooting down the outsider tag, Rajinikanth said he is a pure Tamil now despite his origins from Karnataka. ""Even though I am from Karnataka, still you have accepted me and you have made me into a Tamil. I am a pure Tamil now,"" the superstar said in Chennai. ""I lived in Karnataka for 23 years and Tamil Nadu for 43 years. Although I came as a Marathi from Karnataka, you people nurtured me, made me true Tamilian,"" he said.Thalaiva once again did not clarify whether or not he is joining Tamil Nadu politics. ""Without opposition, there is no entry into politics"" was his cryptic message to his fans, the superstar's meeting with them becoming more frequent lately.With Tamil stalwarts like late J Jayalalithaa and ailing DMK supremo M Karunanidhi out of the picture in the current dispensation, Rajinikanth's fans believe he is the only one who can effectively fill the political vacuum in the state. Earlier this week, the megastar had set tongues wagging with his remarks that that if he joined politics, he would show the door to all ""money-minded"" people. He, however, added that he had no desire to enter the fray, but did not know ""what God had in store for him"".In 1996, the 67-year-old actor had supported the DMK-TMC against J Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, and the alliance swept the polls that year. But he has not been involved in any political activity since then. BJP TRYING TO WOO THALAIVAThe BJP has been trying to rope in the superstar for its entry into the turbulent Tamil Nadu politics. Recently, BJP national secretary H Raja said Rajinikanth is a ""popular"" personality and is welcome to join the saffron party.""He has every right to form a political party or join politics. But so far he has not taken a firm stand. So we have to wait and see. Anybody willing to join the BJP under Narendra Modi's leadership is welcome,"" Raja said.Opposition DMK's acting chief MK Stalin today said he is happy Rajinikanth called him a good leader and that he shouldn't fall for the BJP's wooing. ""I am happy he called me a good leader. The BJP is trying to woo him, but he shouldn't fall (for it). Let Rajini take his decision on politics,"" he told India Today TV.",politics,2977,58,70

Why is there such fear: Mamata on Kajol's 'beef' statement,"West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee today reacted sharply to Bollywood actor Kajol's controversy where the actor reportedly clarified what meat she had eaten recently.Speaking at a public rally in North Dinajpur district, Mamata said the actor had come up with the clarification out of fear. She said there was an environment of fear in which everyone was operating.Slamming the BJP, she said, ""Why is there such fear? Whom should we fear? Since I'm always vocal, they threaten us with the CBI and the ED; threaten us with jail all the time. But let me tell them, even if you put entire Trinamool Congress in jail, I don't care. People will give you a fitting reply.""""They only know how to create riots. They are not in favour of Hindu religion, they are a blot on the name of Hinduism,"" Banerjee added.

That's a miscommunication. What was shown was buffalo meat, that is legally available meat.

HC asks Maha govt to frame policy for safer adventure sports,"While the safety of citizens is ?of paramount consideration?, the state must also promote and ?not discourage adventure sports?, the Bombay high court said. The HC has now asked the Maharashtra government to come up with a fresh, comprehensive policy to regulate adventure sports in the state.A bench of justice Naresh Patil and justice Bharati Dangre asked the government to come up with such a policy in the three months.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation highlighting inadequacies in a government resolution (GR), notified by the state in 2014, to regulate adventure sports across Maharashtra. The GR was issued in compliance with a previous HC order that had asked the state to evolve rules and guidelines to regulate adventure sports. This HC order came after a plea by the parents of a young trekker who died of a respiratory disorder during a Himalayan expedition .Earlier this month, however, a bunch of adventure sports enthusiasts and organisers brought to the court?s notice through their PIL that the GR ? meant to lay down guidelines and instructions for registration of organisations, agents and people who undertake adventure sports activities such as trekking, mountaineering, skiing, snowboarding, handgliding and paragliding ? was not being implemented effectively.The petitioners said several provisions of the GR, especially those pertaining to registration, were ?impractical?. The PIL said the government was yet to constitute the mandatory supervisory committees at the divisional and district levels across the state, as it had failed to identify a ?sufficient number of experts who could supervise the implementation of the GR?.The state government told the court it was aware of the inadequacies in the GR and had decided to revise it. But this revision has been pending since April 2015 owing to a ?difference of opinion between the state tourism department and the sports department?, it said. The HC has now asked the principal secretaries of the departments concerned to sort out these differences and come up with a revised policy. The HC is likely to hear the matter again in eight weeks.",sports,2138,60,70

There has to be some sort of imperfection in you to look real on screen.? I think I did feel low, but at the same time, I did have people who believed in me a lot. That?s what you need.

Noida to survey population density before approving projects,"The Noida authority has decided to conduct a survey of the population in residential and industrial areas to assess if it can allow new projects or additional floor area ratio in existing ones without burdening the existing infrastructure.If the survey report will recommend that no more housing growth be allowed, the authority may stop approving additional housing units that are to come up in existing projects. The authority may also stop approving new housing projects if the survey recommends it, officials said.The authority?s chief executive officer (CEO) Amit Mohan Prasad has constituted a committee to conduct the survey and submit a report within a month.

99% donated player brains had degenerative brain disease,"The largest ever study of cases of football players with the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has, again, found a link between the condition and ?prior participation in football?, particularly in professionals.The study looked at the brains of 111 NFL players and found CTE in 110 of them, or 99% of those studied.Researchers at Boston University and the Boston Veterans Affairs health system examined the brains of 202 high school, college, semi-professional and NFL players for evidence of the disease. They found increasingly severe CTE in players who had spent more time on the field. ?My hope is we?ll stop arguing about whether or not this is a problem, or whether or not it needs to be addressed,? said Dr Ann McKee of Boston University. ?We need to take our heads out of the sand. It?s not going away because we want it to.? CTE is associated with repeated blows to the head, including concussions. Symptoms include difficulty with attention and memory, dementia, mood disorders and headaches. The players in the study had played football for an average of 15 years, and died at a median age of 66 years old. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed after death.Researchers found the most severe cases of CTE in athletes who had played the longest, and at the highest levels. For example, the three high school football players identified with CTE had mild symptoms, but the majority of college and semi-professional players (56%) had severe signs of the disease. Eighty-six percent of professional players had severe CTE. Players with the most severe CTE were also most likely to report clinical symptoms. Of the 84 participants with severe CTE, 80 (95%) had cognitive symptoms, 75 (89%) had behavioral, mood symptoms or both, and 71 (85%) had signs of dementia. Researchers warned that their study can not be used to assess how many people who play football develop CTE, because their sample was not random. The brains were donated by family members, most of whom said their loved ones had reported CTE symptoms during their lifetimes. The former Chicago Bears running back Mike Adamle said he and others have formed a ?fraternity? of players who have suspected cases of the disease. ?The only thing I remember is he said, ?You have symptoms that are concurrent with CTE,?? said Adamle, about a clinical diagnosis from his doctor. ?We?ve got sort of a fraternity of players who just call each other up whenever we need it and for lack of a better phrase talk each other off the ledge ? You really do get paranoid and depressed.?CTE was at first believed to primarily impact boxers, but in recent years it has increasingly become associated with football, hockey and military service. The NFL has for years been under sustained scrutiny because of the head trauma players endure. The NFL maintains that player safety is a top priority. However, as recently as 2016, a congressional investigation accused the NFL of seeking to influence CTE research with donations to the National Institutes of Medicine. The NFL only acknowledged a link between degenerative brain disorders and the sport in 2016, after years of downplaying the links. The league also recently settled a class action lawsuit with players for $1bn. ?This is just the individuals who have come into our bank,? said McKee, noting it is unclear how many more players may have the disease. She said the need to be able to diagnose the disease while people are still alive is increasingly urgent. ?We need to bring them reasons for hope and optimism,? she said. In a statement to the Guardian, the NFL said it welcomed McKee?s research. ?We appreciate the work done by Dr McKee and her colleagues for the value it adds in the ongoing quest for a better understanding of CTE. Case studies such as those compiled in this updated paper are important to further advancing the science and progress related to head trauma. The medical and scientific communities will benefit from this publication and the NFL will continue to work with a wide range of experts to improve the health of current and former NFL athletes. ?As noted by the authors, there are still many unanswered questions relating to the cause, incidence and prevalence of long-term effects of head trauma such as CTE. The NFL is committed to supporting scientific research into CTE and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries.?",science,4414,56,70

UK PM May suspends MP over 'n****r in the woodpile' comment,"Theresa May has ordered the Conservative party?s chief whip to suspend an MP who used the N-word at an event during a discussion about Brexit.Anne Marie Morris, the MP for Newton Abbot in Devon, said sorry for causing offence with her use of the word, after a string of opposition politicians accused her of racism.However, the prime minister decided to suspend the whip from Morris after saying the remarks were shocking and unacceptable.The row broke out after Morris was recorded telling an event: ?Now I?m sure there will be many people who?ll challenge that, but my response and my request is look at the detail, it isn?t all doom and gloom. Now we get to the real nigger in the woodpile, which is, in two years what happens if there is no deal??Her remarks, recorded by the Huffington Post at the East India Club, caused an immediate backlash, with opposition politicians calling on May to withdraw the whip from Morris.Within an hour of the comments emerging, Morris had issued a statement of apology. ?The comment was totally unintentional. I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused,? she said in an email.About three hours later, May released a statement saying Morris was being disciplined and the whip suspended.?I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable,? May said. ?I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip. Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today?s society.?A Conservative source said that May had initially been unaware of the remarks because she was had been with the Australian leader and then in the House of Commons.Morris is likely to carry on voting with the whip but the move notionally reduces May?s fragile majority of just six, if both Conservative and DUP MPs are included.Politicians from across the spectrum expressed their disgust at Morris?s words, including Tory MP Heidi Allen, who said an apology was not enough and the party must show zero tolerance towards racism. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, called in a tweet for the prime minister to take disciplinary action:I'm absolutely appalled by this. I assume PM will take appropriate action? https://t.co/KcOgTc2cM7Tim Farron, the outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats, was one of the first to call for Morris to lose the Tory whip. ?This disgusting comment belongs in the era of the Jim Crow laws and has no place in our parliament,? he said.?The Conservative party should withdraw the whip from Anne Marie Morris and they should do it today. Every hour they leave her in place is a stain on them and the so-called ?compassionate conservatism? they supposedly espouse.?I am utterly shocked that this person represents the good people of Newton Abbot. Even if she mis-spoke, this is the nastiest thing I?ve heard an MP utter since Lord Dixon-Smith uttered the same awful phrase a few years ago.?Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party, also called on the Tories to remove the whip. Appalling. Should have the whip removed immediately. No place in our politics for racism, full stop. https://t.co/khnbjFUVGiAndrew Gwynne, Labour?s campaign coordinator, said Morris?s comments were ?outrageous and totally unacceptable?.?While the Conservative party has tabled a debate on Wednesday to apparently discuss and condemn abuse of candidates in the general election, these comments prove their hypocrisy,? he said.?Theresa May once spoke about changing the Tories? ?nasty party? tag. If she?s serious about that, she will admit it?s not enough for the Tories to ?investigate? and will apologise and act immediately. If that means withdrawing the whip, that?s what they should do.?Earlier this year, Morris distanced herself from comments made by her electoral agent and partner, Roger Kendrick, who told a hustings event that ?the crisis in education was due entirely to non-British-born immigrants and their high birth rates?.In response, Morris told DevonLive: ?I don?t share the views expressed by Roger Kendrick.? One person at the Brexit event contacted the Guardian because he was so shocked about what he had heard Morris say. ?I attended in a professional capacity with a colleague,? he said. ?I work in financial services and was there to hear about the report on enhanced equivalence being published.?I was completely taken aback after hearing such a vile and offensive phrase being used by someone in public life, who should be campaigning against such language being used, not dispensing it herself.?",world,4505,59,70

Manoj Tiwari urges Delhi traders to boycott Chinese goods,"Here's yet another call to boycott Chinese goods in India, this time from the ruling BJP. In the wake of escalating tension along the India-China border, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Friday appealed to Delhi's traders to refuse selling Chinese products as that will be a big blow to the Chinese economy.He said, notwithstanding China's military, its economy was largely dependent on Indian markets and traders here should boycott selling their products to teach the neighbour a lesson. Tiwari was interacting with traders of Khan Market and Hauz Khas Village on Friday evening, regarding their concerns on the roll out of GST.Traders' association of Khan Market said it would ask traders not to sell Chinese goods during the upcoming festive season. ""We will write to the traders of Khan Market to boycott Chinese goods. After all it is in the national interest,"" said Sanjiv Mehra, President of Khan Market Traders' Association.CHINA FRUSTRATED: TIWARIReferring to China in the context of GST, Tiwari said it was troubled by the economic reform in India and the tension on border was an outcome of China's frustration.""China is acting like a goonda. It is disturbed by India's growing economic and strategic power. Since India is the biggest market of Chinese goods, we must stop using them. This will affect China's economy the most,"" Tiwari said.Last year, too, there came up a campaign to boycott Chinese goods in the wake of ""Make in India"", which escalated after the Uri attack, ahead of Diwali. However, Tiwari noted that last year traders had already stocked large quantities of Chinese products such as firecrackers and lights, and hence feared heavy losses.""This year you (traders) should rethink purchasing Chinese products ahead of the festive season,"" he appealed.Another trader of Khan Market said that he supported the call for boycotting Chinese goods, but sought from the government a hassle-free trading environment within the country so that their business was not affected. He also suggested that awareness should be created among the public about the benefits of GST.About the concerns over GST, Tiwari assured the traders that government would not harass citizens.

Ganguly called his shirt-waving celebration a 'big mistake',"Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday regretted taking off his shirt on the Lord's balcony after India's win in the NatWest triangular series in 2002 in England, calling it a mistake.When reminded of the incident, Ganguly said it was only a way of ""relieving the pressure"". ""You make mistakes in life. I made a mistake.

When asked if marriage is akin to captaining India since the first five years are tough, Ganguly quoted actor Shah Rukh Khan, ""As SRK says, end mein sab theek ho jaata hai,"" bringing the house down.The former Indian skipper also said a resurgent Team India will not buckle pressure anymore. ""In 2003, we lost to the best Aussie side under Ricky Ponting.

We are a side comprising players from different islands, representing different cultures. England is one country. India is one country. It's very difficult to get people together in West Indies. You represent different people.""Talking about the 1983 Wold Cup loss to India, Lloyd said, ""What happens on a particular day matters. Whoever plays better wins. India did play well.

Rana Daggubati shares details about prank on co-star Prabhas,"Rana Daggubati and Prabhas play arch-enemies Bhallala Deva and Baahubali on screen. While Prabhas is Baahubali, a man who is kind, benevolent, noble and brave, Rana Daggubati is Bhallala Deva, a conniving, bitter, arrogant and evil person. Prabhas and Rana's on-screen characters could not be more different from each other. But in real life, these two are the best of friends.Prabhas and Rana Daggubati shot for Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali: The Conclusion for up to five years. During this time, the two developed a unique, warm camaraderie that will go beyond the Baahubali films. And as it goes with close friends, these two played pranks on each other.Rana Daggubati in a recent episode of the chat show Konchem Touch lo Unte Chepta spilled out the beans about one such prank. Turns out, Rana made a prank call to Prabhas and said that he wanted help because the police has caught him!Prabhas patiently listened to Rana and then said, ""Tell the police that you are in Baahubali 2 as my companion and they will leave you.""Seems like either Prabhas was way too much in character to speak as boldly as Baahubali does in the films. Or he saw through Rana Daggubati's prank.Meanwhile, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is breaking all kinds of Indian box-office records.

Ask psychiatrist why Censors fear female sexuality: Shah,"Naseeruddin Shah has watched the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring his wife Ratna Pathak Shah, twice. And the veteran actor can?t figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. ?I really don?t know what problem they had with the film. I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. What the film?s success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. I have seen the film twice, and it?s a wonderfully made film that talks about what?s going on in society. I don?t know why the Censor Board had a problem with that,? he quips. The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldn?t be given had called the film ?lady-oriented?, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors. Afterwards, the Lipstick team got the required clearance from a parallel body. This has been one of the most high-profile tussles between the Censor Board and film teams in recent memory.With Lipstick?s release stalled for almost six months, director Alankrita Shrivastava and her team fought to get a clean chit, and finally received it from the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, which asked for 16 cuts in the film. Naseeruddin Shah says, ?One has to ask a psychiatrist as to why they are afraid of [female sexuality] on screen. It?s very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn?t like. But the success of such films prove that no one is bothered about what the Censor Board or the doubters think about [these] films.?Shah also criticises the Censor Board for being dictatorial. ?For starters,? he says, ?they are supposed to give a film a certificate; they are no authority to ban a film, or stay its release. But then they claim to be someone who can do that. Their narrow-minded approach affects the film industry. But nothing has been done about it.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,2048,56,70

JD(U) gives RJD 4 days to decide on Tejashwi's resignation,"Bihar?s ruling allies appeared headed for a major confrontation on Tuesday, with a senior Janata Dal (United) leader saying partner Rashtriya Janata Dal has four days to dispel corruption allegations against deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav and his father Lalu Prasad. The announcement came amid mounting pressure on chief minister Nitish Kumar to sack Tejashwi, who along with Lalu is facing charges in an alleged land-for-hotels scandal that saw the Central Bureau of Investigation raiding their homes and other properties last week.Chief minister Nitish Kumar asked Tejashwi Yadav to give a ?fact-wise reply in public? to the corruption charges hurled at him but said the ruling Grand Alliance won?t break. ?So far, the reply or explanation given by them is not satisfactory. They should come out with fact-wise reply in public,? the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) leader told his party leaders, breaking his silence on the younger son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad.Never had a ruling alliance partner?s meeting evinced such interest as did JD (U)?s meeting held at Kumar?s official residence, 1 Anney Marg. A short distance away, at 10 Circular Road, Tejashwi played cricket with children while Congress leaders watched the development from Sadaquat Ashram.Lalu was away at Ranchi appearing in a fodder scam case in CBI special court. To drive home his ?zero tolerance against corruption principle?, the JD(U), which has 71 MLAs compared to the RJD?s 80 and Congress 27, gave the example of former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, RN Singh of JD(U) and Ramadhar Singh of BJP, who were asked to resign when graft charges surfaced against them in 2005. The NDA now has 58 members in 243 member assembly. ?The chief minister made it clear that so far he has not compromised on standards set for corruption and even a leader of another constituent of a former alliance partner was made to resign,? said party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar. ?We expect clarifications in full from them (RJD).?The RJD was quick to rule out Tejashwi?s resignation and called the allegations a BJP conspiracy to break the grand alliance. Kumar, during his address to the state executive meeting is learnt to have said if the RJD presents no solution, he was ready for the inevitable -- no compromise with principles, which could mean shedding the allies. ?The meeting authorised him to take any political decision,? said the JD (U) spokesperson. The party is expected to convene a meeting later in the week if the RJD doesn?t come to a decision by then. Sources said Kumar referred to corruption charges that were being raised by BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi and said they were the same that the JD(U) had spoken of in 2008.?We practise what we preach and there is no scope for any compromise on it?, added Neeraj Kumar.",general,2776,58,70
Jailed couple ran prostitution ring from Tihar jail: Reports,"The rescue of a 16-year-old girl from Delhi?s red light district on Monday brought the Capital?s wide-spread prostitution racket under spotlight. The girl was rescued by the West Bengal Police from brothel number 56, which is owned by a couple lodged in Tihar jail. Afaq Husain and Saria Begum have been allegedly trafficking girls and forcing them into prostitution for the past 17 years. They have been arrested at least seven times in the past and are currently booked under the non-bailable Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). However, this has failed to stop the racket they run at Delhi?s red light district ? GB Road. Monday?s rescue operation came after raids at the same brothel in August in which the couple was arrested. It raised questions on the crime branch?s claim that the prostitution syndicate run by the couple had been busted.The rescued girl, who is from Durgapur in West Bengal, was trafficked in 2014 and forced into prostitution. ?The girl took a mobile phone from a customer and called her father. We traced the location through the phone call and contacted the local police. The girl was rescued from the brothel,? said Umakant of the West Bengal Police, who is the investigating officer in the case.According to the Delhi Police crime branch, over 80% business at GB Road is controlled by two-three operators, who have their own network of agents. Afaq and Saria are allegedly the influential operators who control everything from a distant location through handpicked brothel managers.?The fact that the Delhi Police had raided the same place in August 2016, when this girl was probably confined there, says a lot about the nexus of the traffickers. Instead of just arresting the traffickers, the police must break the nexus,? said Rishi Kant of the Shakti Vahini NGO, who assisted the West Bengal Police in the operation.The crime branch admitted that girls are sold to the brothel owners for Rs 1 lakh and the victims are confined in hidden cells, thrashed, intoxicated, starved and forced into commercial activity.?While the victims are compelled to live in terrible conditions, their distressed family members keep running from pillar to post to trace them. The crime branch studied the crime pattern to institute effective action against the key perpetrators and real beneficiaries of this illegal trade,? the crime branch said in August.The Delhi Police has also proposed to seal the brothel owned by the couple and the matter is pending in the court.?At the time of rescue, our team had asked the girls if they wanted to come with us as there are many adult girls who prefer to stay. Those, who agreed, were rescued while the rest were allowed to stay. The couple is still in jail,? said a senior crime branch official.The victims, most of whom are minors from poor families, are trafficked from Nepal and various other parts of the country by agents in an organised manner. The girls are brought to Delhi on the pretext of lucrative jobs and marriage.",general,3003,60,70

Rajasthan won't allow distorting Padmavati history: Minister,"The Karni Sena, who were in the limelight for their vicious attack on Padmavati director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, have received support from a senior BJP member and minister in the Vasundhara Raje government. Vasudev Devnani, the Minister for Education in Rajasthan, has expressed solidarity with the Karni Sena view and said that distortion of history will not be tolerated. ""People of Rajasthan will not permit the distortion of the glorious history of Rani Padmavati. If someone does not want to shoot their film here, so be it,"" said Devnani.The Rajasthan government had been panned for the lack of any stringent action against the Karni Sena. A video showing the vicious attack on Sanjay Leela Bhansali and the vandalism carried out on the sets of Padmavati at Jaipur's Jaigarh Fort had gone viral. No FIR or formal police complaint was registered in the matter.However, the Rajasthan Home Minister and the state police had claimed that action will be taken if a formal complaint is made against the Karni Sena men. The Karni Sena, however, claimed it was Bhansali's bodyguards who opened fire on their men when they reached the sets of Padmavati, which led to the entire fracas. Bhansali had suspended the shooting and left for Mumbai soon after. Talks about compromise gathered pace as Bhansali's production unit and the Karni Sena tried finding common ground. The Karni Sena objected to any romantic scene being shown between Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji. However, the production house has insisted there is no romantic dream sequence or objectionable scene between Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji in the script.With the Rajasthan minister clearly expressing his viewpoint, the Karni Sena may feel further emboldened on the issue.

70 Mumbai buildings ordered to reduce height in 60 days,"Flat buyers who will lose their homes following the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) order to reduce the height of 70 buildings in the flight path of aircraft said they were being made scapegoats by the authorities. They said on Monday that they had bought the apartments legally and blamed officials for not checking the rules while approving construction plans. Some of these structures were built around 50 years ago. Jagdish Desai, secretary, Forum for Improving the Quality of Life in Suburbs, said the move was ill-advised. ?These people have used their life savings to buy these apartments and now they are being told that their houses are illegal. Residents are bearing the brunt of the mistakes authorities committed,? said Desai.The 70 buildings are located in Vile Parle, Ghatkopar and Santacruz. A survey conducted by the Mumbai International Airport Ltd and the Airport Authority of India between 2010 and 2011 identified 137 structures and classified them as obstacles.A resident of one of the affected buildings at Santacruz said most of the residents in these buildings are senior citizens. ?We bought the apartment in 1977 and after 40 years, we are being told that our house will be demolished. Imagine our shock on realising that we soon might not have a roof over our heads,? said the resident, who requested not to be named. Even those who live on lower floors are worried. ?Our entire building will be damaged if we demolish even one floor,? said a ground-floor resident of a Ghatkopar building affected by the order. The DGCA initiated action based on a Bombay high court order which took serious note of the violations. The court said after finding rampant violations of height norms by private developers, the authorities could not sit back ?waiting for an accident to take place?. The bench was hearing a petition filed by activist Yashwant Shenoy seeking action against all such structures around the airport that are in violation of the height norms.",general,1992,55,70

In addition, this approach, focusing on universal coverage of free publicly financed PHC services, closely matches the UHC strategy recommended by India?s high level expert group which reported to the previous federal government in 2011,? the memorandum read.The number of suggestions to further reform the health project includes undertaking a formal evaluation of the Mohalla Clinics programme, improve management information systems for maintaining patients? records and better monitoring, and lastly, scaling up preventive and community based services.

"RBI stops printing ?2,000 notes: Reports","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stopped printing 2,000-rupee notes about five months ago, stepping up instead the production of smaller bills, including a new Rs 200, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The central bank is also unlikely to print more 2000-rupee notes in the current financial year, they said on condition of anonymity.The government brought in the 2000-rupee note to quickly tide over a cash crunch from demonetisation, but fewer lower-value currency in circulation meant people struggled to change the big denomination bill.The RBI?s focus now on printing small bills is aimed at bridging that gap.About 3.7 billion 2,000-rupee notes amounting to Rs 7.4 trillion have been printed, said one of the people cited above. That more than compensates for the 6.3 billion 1,000-rupee bills withdrawn from November 8.?Most of the printing that?s being done, about 90% is only 500-rupee notes. Nearly 14 billion pieces of new 500-rupee notes have been printed so far,? one of the people cited above said.That is also close to the 15.7 billion of old 500-rupee notes (amounting to Rs7.85 trillion) withdrawn from circulation after November 8.Not all the new notes printed so far have been released into circulation by the central bank.RBI data shows that currency in circulation stood at Rs 15.22 trillion as on 14 July, eight months after demonetisation. This is about 86% of the Rs 17.7 trillion that was in circulation on November 4.Separately, the RBI?s Mysore press has also started printing the new 200-rupee bills, which are likely to come into circulation next month, according to a second person.?Initially, around a billion 200-rupee notes are expected to hit the market,? this person added.The central bank did not respond to an email seeking comment.The new batches of 500-rupee notes are expected to ease the shortage of 2,000-rupee notes in circulation that is being reported in certain parts of the country.?The cash crunch which existed till two months ago has now eased with RBI increasing supply of 500-rupee notes over the last 40 days,? said Neeraj Vyas, deputy managing director, State Bank of India (SBI).?But we have also seen a sharp drop in the supply of 2,000-rupee notes during this period.?A July 19 report from SBI?s economic research wing showed that cash on hand with banks is high at 5.4% of currency in circulation compared with 3.8% pre-demonetisation. This shows that there is excess cash lying in ATMs or bank branches, most of which could mostly be 2,000-rupee notes, concluded the report.?Although we haven?t seen any drop in supply of 2,000-rupee notes, we expect it to be moved out of ATMs once 200-rupee notes hit the market,? said Radha Rama Dorai, country head, ATM and allied services, at ATM service provider FIS.(Additional reporting by Mahua Venkatesh)",business,2819,40,70

Gopal Ansal surrenders in Uphaar fire tragedy case,"New Delhi, Mar 20 (PTI) Gopal Ansal surrendered today before Tihar jail authorities to undergo one-year jail term in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case after the Supreme Court refused to grant him more time. A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul rejected the plea moved by the real estate baron seeking more time to surrender on the ground that he has moved a mercy plea before the President, and had asked him to surrender by this evening. ""Ansal surrendered around 5-5.30 PM. He is currently lodged in the hospital at Jail No. 3 as he complained of some health issues,"" said a jail official. The bench said, ""Sorry, we cant,"" when senior advocate Ram Jethmalani mentioned the matter and sought more time, telling the court that they have already approached the President with their mercy plea. The apex court also rejected the plea from the senior advocate seeking a direction for speedy disposal of his mercy plea, pending before the President, saying that it cannot interfere in it as it is an exclusive jurisdiction of the President. The apex court, on March 9, had dismissed Ansals petition for parity with his elder brother Sushil Ansal, who was awarded jail term already undergone by him considering his ""age-related complications"", and directed him to surrender by today to serve the prison term. 69-year-old Gopal Ansal was in jail earlier for around four-and-a-half-month in connection with the case relating to the June 13, 1997 fire tragedy in which 59 persons had died in Uphaar cinema during the screening of Hindi movie Border.

"Trump considering pardon for family, aides in Russia probe","The highest-ranking Democrat on the US Senate intelligence committee has said it was ?extremely disturbing? if Donald Trump was contemplating a pardon for aides that could be implicated in a probe on Russian meddling in last year?s election.Senator Mark Warner was referring to a Washington Post article late Thursday saying that Trump was consulting with advisers ?about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself? in connection to the probe led by special counsel and former FBI director Robert Mueller.It is not clear whether it is possible for a US president to pardon themselves. The constitution does not explicitly prohibit self-pardons, but it has never been done before.The nearest precedent is supplied by Richard Nixon, who sought advice on the question as he faced the prospect of impeachment for obstruction of justice and abuse of power following the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. Nixon?s personal lawyer advised him that he could pardon himself, but the justice department said he could not, according to Brian C Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University whose recent book, Constitutional Cliffhangers, devotes a chapter to the issue.Nixon resigned and was eventually pardoned by his successor, president Gerald Ford.""It really is uncharted territory,"" Kalt said.? ""Anyone who?s certain is wrong.""Trump?s lawyers were attempting to ?corral the probe? and were compiling a list of Mueller?s alleged potential conflicts of interest in order to ?stymie his work?, according to the Post, which quoted anonymous sources for the article.In a statement, Warner said that Russia?s interference in the 2016 elections ?was an attack on our democracy. Both the Senate intelligence committee and special counsel Mueller are currently investigating whether any coordination occurred between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign?.?The possibility that the president is considering pardons at this early stage in these ongoing investigations is extremely disturbing,? said Warner, the senior senator from Virginia and vice-chair of the intelligence committee.?Pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line.?The White House has yet to comment on the Post report.In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump warned Mueller that some of his family finances should be off-limits to his investigation.Asked if Mueller looking at finances unrelated to Russia would be a red line, Trump responded: ?I would say yes.?A move by Trump?s legal team to look for conflicts of interest among members of Mueller?s investigative team was also reported by both the New York Times and Associated Press on Thursday.AP said two people with knowledge of the investigative process say efforts under way include exploring the political affiliations of Mueller?s investigators and their work history.Attorney Jay Sekulow, a member of the president?s external legal team, told AP that the lawyers ?will consistently evaluate the issue of conflicts and raise them in the appropriate venue?.On Friday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said it was only fair to expose any potential conflicts of interest of investigators helping Mueller examine Russia?s interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.Conway told Fox News? ?Fox & Friends? that members of Mueller?s team have contributed to Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the past. ?It?s relevant that people know what the motivations are. That is not an attack on the team.?Mueller and congressional committees are investigating whether the president?s campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. While Trump has assailed the inquiries as a partisan ?witch hunt?, the investigations have increasingly drawn in his family and close advisers, including son Donald Trump Jr and son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.As the investigations intensify, Trump?s legal team is also undergoing a shake-up. New York-based attorney Marc Kasowitz, whose unconventional style has irked some White House aides, is seen as a diminishing presence in the operation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.Mark Corallo, who has been working as a spokesman for the legal team, is no longer part of the operation, according to those familiar with the situation.

Shahid wanted to be called 'superstar' by a magazine: Report,"Is Shahid Kapoor a star or a superstar? The answer to that depends on whether you are a 'Shanatic' or not. Well, Shahid himself thought he was a superstar but unfortunately, the editor of a popular film magazine had to disagree.According to Rajeev Masand's latest column in Open Magazine, it all began when Shahid Kapoor did a photoshoot for the cover of a 'popular film glossy' a few days before the release of his film Rangoon. The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'. Shahid said that if the magazine team did not want to make the change, he wanted the entire story 'pulled'.Consequently, the magazine team made the required change and the edition was sent to the press for printing.But Rangoon finally released and flopped big time. The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again. So, the new headline focused on Shahid Kapoor recently becoming a father.",general,1360,60,70
Bookies lost ?2500 cr after India's loss to Pakistan: Report,"When India lost to arch-rivals Pakistan in Sunday's Champions Trophy cricket final match in London, it not only broke millions of hearts but also left hundreds of bettors and bookmakers broke. According to an estimate, over 80-90 per cent Indian punters staked their money on the Men in Blue who were the firm favourites with a brilliant 12-2 record against their neighbours in ICC events. A total of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore was riding on the match that transfixed two nations and received eye-popping media coverage. Legal gambling in India is confined to horse-racing while casinos are allowed only in a couple of states. Sikkim is the only state that allows betting on sports including cricket. But the underground market in the country is worth thousands of crores, say observers. NO BETS ON HOCKEY MATCHBookies told Mail Today that huge sums of money were riding on Team India- not just within the country but also gambling hubs abroad such as in the Gulf nations- as this was one of the most-anticipated sporting events in months. However, there were no takers in the betting bazaar for the Hockey World League semi-final game on Sunday in which India demolished Pakistan 7-1. ""When the (cricket) match started, the odds were in favour of India. If the Men in Blue would have won the match, then punters would have earned 80 paise for every rupee while Pakistan's rate was around Rs 3.40,"" a Delhi-based bookie told this reporter. Pakistan inflicted a massive 180-run defeat upon title-holders and favourites India at the Oval in London to win the tournament featuring the world's top eight one-day international nations. PATRIOTISM MATTERS IN BETSThe bookmaker said almost all his 50-60 customers lost money as they had placed their bets on India. Till India dropped two early wickets, the rate chart in the gambling circuit was in favour Virat Kohli's boys. Even the massive total of 338 put up by Pakistan failed to deter bookies. History was unequivocally on India's side. The team had comprehensively beaten Pakistan when they met in the group stage. Experts claim that in an India-Pakistan match, patriotism plays a key role for bettors. ""It is certain that most of the Indian punters burnt their fingers in the match. The Indian team was stronger and had also defeated Pakistan in the tournament earlier, so huge money was riding on it. Even patriotism was at an all- time high and maximum bets were placed on Team India,"" said Jay Sayta, founder of GLaws.in, a gaming laws' web portal. According to experts, gambling was at its peak during the match as the viewership too was massive with premium advertisement rates. ""Not only Indians, but many international punters too burnt their fingers by putting money on India. Even after Pakistan ended their batting and put up a huge score before India, the odds were in favour of Virat's team due to the strong batting line-up and ability to chase down big totals,"" said another bookie from Mumbai. SIKKIM BOOKIES ON FIREThe only legal outlet for sports betting in India, which is in Sikkim, also witnessed a sharp rise in business volume. ""Our feeds before the match started were in favour of India as the rate was 1.6 while the rate for Pakistan was over 2.20. This means that if a player had placed Rs 100 on Pakistan, then he or she would have got Rs 220 in return. But most of the people invested on India,"" said Ratul Sethi of Golden Gaming. Sethi explained that the rates at the sports betting zone change at frequent intervals and as the game moved on rates shifted in favour of Pakistan. ""Not everyone playing at our outlet lost money as players can invest on different probables like scores in an over, next wicket, run rates, etc. We also promote sensible gaming so we advise players to place their bets reasonably,"" Sethi said. However, he said there were no takers for the India-Pakistan hockey match. While gambling is illegal in the country, Indians can lay their bets through UK websites with international credit cards and e-wallets. The bets are not only placed on the outcome of a match but also on other factors.Also read: Breaking TV sets, burning posters to crying on roads; How Indian fans found closure after Champions Trophy defeat",general,4212,60,70
