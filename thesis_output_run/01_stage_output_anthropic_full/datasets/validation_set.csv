Daddy isn't a propaganda film: Rampal on Arun Gawli biopic,"Mumbai, Jun 21 (PTI) Actor Arjun Rampal, whose film ""Daddy"" is based on the life of Arun Gawli, says the movie is not an attempt to glorify the life of the gangster-turned- politician. The 44-year-old actor insists that it should be left to the audience to form an opinion about Gawli after watching the biopic, directed by Ashim Ahluwalia of ""Miss Lovely"" fame. ""He has so many layers in life and they are so intriguing. Its not that we are making a propaganda film about him... The audience needs to make an opinion about him,"" Arjun told PTI. The actor says he is not glorifying Gawli on screen and is presenting his life story the way it is. ""Ashim Ahluwalia wanted to say something strong and poignant through Daddy. It is not siding with anybody, it is not about glamourising someone but showing the realism of that world and bringing it out to people."" The actor does not believe that he has taken a risk by making a biopic on a gangster rather than opting for an achievers life as is the norm in Bollywood. ""Any film is a gamble or risk. You dont know what film is what. Like Neerja is a a biopic on an air hostess. Who would have thought that it will work? Every film is a risk as the idea or story might sound interesting but it can either go right or wrong,"" he says.",general,1279,58,70
Bike set on fire after it hits Kanwar procession in Gurugram,"Angry locals and Kanwarias allegedly set on fire a motorcycle owned by unidentified men, after it hit their Dak Mahakanwar at Sohna town on Thursday afternoon.Dak Kanwar is a procession, wherein devotees collect water from the Ganges and carry it to their local shiva shrines. The objects in which the water is being carried have to keep moving until it reaches the destination, according to the beliefs.The Kanwarias alleged that three youths allegedly hit them with an intention to create trouble and escaped soon after the incident. Although the police maintained that it was a minor accident, they said that however, they are probing the matter to know the antecedents of the youths on the bike and also if there was any other angle to the matter. A case against unidentified persons might be filed for setting the bike on fire, police said. The incident happened when a procession comprising 16 men from Tauru town in Mewat reached the Tikona Park, where the locals alleged that three youths on a bike hit the Kanwarias with a stick and also punched them.?Three or four Kanwarias were injured, but they tried to protect the Dak Mahakanwar. In the melee, the miscreants escaped. Pilgrims and locals tried to chase them. The motorcycle fell at Agarsen Chowk, but the youths managed to escape,? said Anil Mendiratta, a Tauru resident, who has beeing undertaking the procession from Tauru for several years.Kanwarias often get agitated when their way is blocked and it often leads to skirmishes.Tauru resident Gaurav Gauba, who was pushing the Kanwar, said that unidentified youths on bike tried to force their way among the Kanwarias, and one among them punched him. On this, his associate Manoj pushed the bikers. The bikers fled when the people tried to attack them. Soon after the incident, the locals and the pilgrims congregated and shouted slogans against the administration for failing to protect their procession from interruptions and taking action against the interruptors. As per information, the Mahadak Kanwar had left Haridwar on July 16 and was scheduled to reach Tauru on Thursday. The Kanwar entered Sohna town from Chungi No 1 around 1 pm and it took almost an hour to pass through the main Sohna Bazaar as people paid their obeisance. Meanwhile, the police said that as soon as they received the message on the skirmish, they rushed to the spot and managed to pacify the crowd.?Prima facie, it appears to be a minor accident. But we are probing the matter from all angles. Security is being provided to all the Kanwars passing through the town and the situation is under control,? said Brahm Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Sohna.",general,2661,60,70

Kin of ISIS militant killed in Lucknow refuse to accept body,"At least for an hour suspected terrorist Saifullah's brother and Uttar Pradesh Police tried to make him surrender even as he was hiding in a house in Haji Colony of Lucknow's Thakurganj area.The invocation of Prophet Mohammad did not deter him to drop the gun. He was finally gunned down following a 12-hour siege and anti-terror operation that ended today morning.His father Sartaj said the family will not take accept the body of an ""anti-national"". ""He left home two months ago after I had beaten him up for not working. Last Monday he called me up and said he is going to Saudi Arabia,"" he said.Sartaj said that what his son did was ""not in the country's interest"". ""We will not accept the body of an anti-national,"" he said. Top sources in the Uttar Pradesh Police told India Today that what Saifullah and his associates were planning was nothing less than ""disastrous."" A senior police officer said the plans if executed would have been ""catastrophic"".SAIFULLAH WAS ADAMANTAll possible efforts were made by police to dissuade Saifullah but sources said he was adamant despite his family's intervention.When Saifullah did not surrender despite persuasion by police, a meeting took place between top officers of the Uttar Pradesh Police to chalk out a strategy to discourage him from resisting security forces. Police by then had managed to identify Saifullah's relatives and decided to rope them in to talk him into surrendering.Senior police officers opened channels of communication and made his Kanpur-based brother Khalid speak to him for at least one hour. Saifullah, however, was not receptive; rather he was hostile and did not respond. He was ""screaming that he wanted to die"".FOCUS ON STUDIES, SAID FATHER His brother Khalid then tried to bring in their father Sartaj to talk to him. Sartaj was in tears and tried his best to convince him but in vain. He told Saifullah that he should devote himself to studies and not terror activities. At one point, his brother Khalid invoked Prophet Mohammad and asked Saifullah to give up in the name of Prophet. Saifullah, however, was not prepared to listen to anything. Officers said he was indoctrinated to a point where family members found it impossible to make him see the other side. ""His family members were shattered when they discovered that someone who had spent his childhood and best years of his life with them was not willing to listen to them at all,"" said a senior police officer. ISIS INCREASING PRESENCE IN INDIAWhen the family members failed to dissuade him, police launched a full-scale operation to eliminate him, a senior police officer said.The Lucknow encounter shows that ISIS, which has so far asked Muslim youth to join them in the fight in Syria and Iraq, is now increasing its footprint in India with its Khorasan module .After receiving a tip-off from police in Telangana and Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh police swooped down on Saifulla's hideout.WHAT HAPPENED ON GROUND ZEROPolice drilled holes and used fiber-optic cameras to monitor his movement. They fired tear gas and chilly shells to force him out of the house. ATS commandos issued a warning and stormed inside the house. Saifullah opened fire and in retaliation ATS commandos started firing. The rooms were searched, and Saifullah was found dead. The commandos saw a wire wrapped around his stomach, possibly to carry out a fidayeen attack. The UP police wanted to catch him alive as his interrogation could have shed light on the ISIS' Khorasan module, its plans and its sympathisers. Large cache of arms and ammunition, explosives, maps, ISIS flags were seized from the hideout. WATCH: Lucknow encounter: Know Saifullah, the killed ISIS suspectALSO READ:",general,3701,60,70
Delhi policeman helps arrest son who stabbed woman 9 times,"For ASI Raj Singh, 52, his son was guilty of stabbing a woman who spurned him and had to be brought to justice. Singh knew his son deserved to be behind bars and had even threatened his relatives against helping, Amit, evade arrest. On Wednesday night, when Delhi police were grappling for clues to crack the case, Singh walked into the Najafgarh police station and offered to help the investigating officer arrest his son.

Govt seeks Interpol's help to curb child pornography,"The Narendra Modi government has roped in international police agency Interpol in a bid to crack down on sexual abuse and pornography of children amid a surge in photographs and videos on the internet showing kids being sexually exploited.EXPLOSION IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHYExperts say the advent of digital cameras and camcorders has fueled an explosion in such material available online. Last year, 96 reports of children being sexually exploited in internet imagery were reported in India - a rise of 140 per cent from 2014, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data. ""IT ministry has approved a formal agreement wherein Department of Telecommunications will obtain list maintained by INTERPOL containing domain names hosting child sexual abuse contents and act as an appropriate agency of the government to direct its licensee ISPs to expeditiously remove or disable access to material found in violation of the IT Act,"" the Centre said in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court. ""Further the mechanism to obtain the list containing domain names hosting contents of child sexual abuse is being worked out in consultation with the CBI."" The top court asked the Centre in February to suggest ways to ban child pornography in all forms in the country saying that the nation cannot ""afford to carry on any experiment"" in the name of ""liberty or freedom of speech and expression"". INTERPOL A MAJOR ASSET The SC was hearing PILs filed by Indore-based advocate Kamlesh Vaswani and Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association seeking a direction to the government to adopt various measures towards improvement in the effectiveness of blocking child pornography on the Internet and to eliminate it. RP Saxena, co-ordinator of the cyber Laws and e-security group of the government, said in the affidavit that a meeting was convened recently to seek cooperation and support from Internet Service Providers, which in turn can play an important role by blocking or disabling the lists containing domain names/URLs/website addresses hosting child pornography content. Interpol is a major source of getting access to such lists of websites containing child sexual abuse. The agency maintains a regular update of the ""worst"" of such sites. Interpol has been tasked by the UN General Assembly in 2009 to maintain and disseminate to the national central bureaus a worldwide list of URLs, which contains these websites that publish the most severe child abuse material. Ordering a crackdown against child porn, the SC had said that one needs to draw a distinct line between art and obscenity and child pornography cannot be justified in the name of freedom of speech and expression.",technology,2670,52,70

Deepika to replace Varun as lead in Badlapur sequel: Reports,"Badlapur, directed by Sriram Raghavan, was a turning point in Varun Dhawan's career and established his acting credentials. Made on a modest budget, the film went on to earn thrice its budget, and brought its director Sriram Raghavan (Ek Hasina Thi, Johnny Gaddaar) much-needed commercial success.Now, according to latest reports, a Badlapur sequel is being planned and it might just star none other than Deepika Padukone. Badlapur was a bloody, revenge thriller where the hero, played by Varun Dhawan, went on a killing rampage to punish those that were responsible for the end of his family.

While some reports claimed that Malaika was seeing a UK-based businessman, fingers were pointed at Arjun Kapoor too for having caused a rift between the couple. There were rumours that Arjun Kapoor and Malaika were involved in an affair that led to the separation.However, in their joint statement, Malaika and Arbaaz clarified that too. They said, ""We are not separated because of a third random person, like there were stories of a friendship between a businessman and Malaika.

She is not crying on her brother-in-law Salman's shoulders, asking him to help. They are our family, so please don't talk about them like that.""",general,2399,49,70
Mohalla clinic report showing blood sugar at 9500 goes viral,"A six-month-old medical report from a mohalla clinic in Delhi showing an abnormally high blood sugar level of 9,481.7 mg/dl for a patient, has gone viral on social media.The normal level is usually less than 140 mg/dl, post meals.The AAP government, which runs the clinics, has however dismissed the report as ?forged?, saying such messages are being spread to discredit the mohalla clinic system.The HbA1c test result, which measures the average blood glucose level over a period of time, shows the glucose levels of the patient are 332%, whereas a healthy person should have below 6%.This report resurfaced on Twitter on Friday, days after Delhi?s vigilance team started investigation into mohalla clinic doctors, calling patients for unnecessary follow-ups.Twitterati went berserk with comments, blaming doctors and the labs for botched tests and treatment.?OMG!!! This is shocking.

However, a similar report had been doing the rounds on social media last year and we found that it had been forged using stationery from the labs,? an official said, adding that labs have been asked to be careful about their stationery.Noting that the mohalla clinic system, which provides consultation, medicine and tests, has benefitted several people, the official said these messages are being spread to discredit the system.He also said that even if such a report a came from their labs, there is a doctor to check it. ?And, the doctor would never treat based on such a test report they would resend the samples.?Last year, BJP MLA Vijender Gupta had questioned the quality of healthcare provided at mohalla clinics, citing the example of a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with thalassemia at one clinic and the report was allegedly incorrect according to a private lab.?A D-10 haemoglobin electrophoresis by Bio-Rad, the accepted golden standard test, was performed for the woman and she was found to be carrying thalassemia trait,? an official had informed HT.Carrying the trait does not mean that a person is suffering from thalassemia, but, if the husband also carries the gene, there are 25% chances that the baby suffers from the genetic blood defect, the official explained.",general,2615,60,70

From having no seat to winning 21 and then going on to form the government is a big achievement. This shows the faith and trust people of the northeast have in PM Modi.""Now a convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance or NEDA, Sarma quit the Congress and joined the BJP in August 2015. This after he fell out with the Congress leadership for reportedly not considering him for the chief minister's post in Assam.

We had planned this victory in Manipur about six months ago and started working hard for it.""When asked how he saw BJP's gaining a stronghold in the northeast in the context of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sarma said, ""Amit Shah laid special focus on the northeast as an area of expansion for the BJP.

For this, we need more and more BJP governments in the region so that central schemes initiated by PM Modi can be implemented at the ground level.""Talking about assembly elections in Nagaland, Manipur and Meghalaya, the 3 northeastern states that go to polls next year, he said, ""We plan to wrest Tripura from the Left and Meghalaya from Congress.""Reacting sharply to allegations by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi that BJP undermined democracy by using money power to form its government in Manipur, Sarma said, ""We got 30 or 31 seats not by luring people by offering them money. National People's Party (NPP) is a part of NEDA and so is the Naga People's Front. LJP led by Ram Vilas Paswan is already a part of the Union government. We got Manipur only by uniting friends.

We want to integrate PM Modi's vision with northeast states to put them on the path of development.""When asked about what he thought about Congress winning Punjab, Sarma said, ""Congress' win in Punjab is mainly Captain Amarinder Singh's victory. It is about time Congress started thinking beyond the Gandhi family for its own good.""He added, ""Congress needs to get away from the high command culture and build regional satraps.

Ahmedabad to celebrate 'Heritage City' status for 15 days,"The BJP-led Gujarat government is going all out to celebrate the world heritage city status accorded to Ahmedabad by UNESCO earlier this month with an eye on assembly elections later this year.

As part of the gala event, the state government in association with central ministries has chalked out elaborate programmes for a two-week-long festival, which includes heritage walk, cultural events, lectures and seminars to showcase the over 600-year-old city founded by emperor Ahmed Shah. During the fortnight, all flights bound for the state will serve a variety of Gujarati cuisines to passengers. ?The idea is to involve people from all walks of life in the celebrations that will be organised across the city. It is a big boost for the city to be given the world heritage status,? said a state government official. The elaborate programmes also aimed at highlighting the heritage-tag for the Ahmedabad as a major success story of the BJP government in the state. The celebrations will coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s visit to his home state on August 12 to inaugurate the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada. Chief ministers of 12 states ruled by BJP and its allies are expected to attend the event.Ahmedabad is the first Indian city to get the coveted heritage status.

Russian team scores 11 own goals to have easier matchup next,"Two clubs in the winter sport of bandy raced to put the ball into their own nets 20 times on Sunday and now face disciplinary action.The Russian Super League game in the northern city of Arkhangelsk finished in an 11-9 win for Baikal-Energiya against local club Vodnik. It was 0-0 with 22 minutes to go before Vodnik player Oleg Pivovarov scored three own goals.Baikal-Energiya responded with nine own-goals in quick succession. Not to be outdone, Pivovarov then put the ball into his own team?s goal eight more times in the final seven minutes.Both teams now face ?very tough measures,? Russian Bandy Federation president Boris Skrynnik told the Tass news agency.He accused Vodnik of starting the own-goal extravaganza in order to ?play against a convenient team? in the upcoming playoffs. Had Vodnik won, it would have faced the league?s reigning champion.The result mattered less to Baikal-Energiya, which was already assured of facing a much weaker club in the playoffs. As a result, its players ?decided to have some fun? and score own goals too, Skyrnnik claimed.Not well known outside Russia and Scandinavia, bandy is a relative of ice hockey played on a large outdoor rink with a rubber ball. It?s played at semi-professional level in Russia.Sunday?s game carries echoes of a scandal at the 2012 Olympics in badminton. Eight female players from South Korea, China and Indonesia deliberately made basic errors in the group stage as they tried to manipulate the draw for the next round. All were disqualified from the Olympics.In soccer, a 2002 Madagascan league game reportedly saw the Stade Olympique de l?Emyrne team score a record 149 own-goals as a protest against what they felt was unfair refereeing.",world,1713,60,70
Stop using remixed song: Despacito singers to Venezuela Prez,"Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro?s attempt to use Latin hit Despacito - which means ?slowly? ? to inject some cool into his controversial new congress has backfired quickly.

Despacito!? goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduro?s weekly televised show. ?What do you think, eh? Is this video approved?? a grinning and clapping Maduro called out to the crowd, which roared back in approval. But Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee on Monday said they do not approve at all.?At no point was I asked, nor did I authorize, the use or the change in lyrics of Despacito for political ambitions, and much less in the middle of a deplorable situation that Venezuela, a country I love so much, is living,? Fonsi said in a message posted on Twitter. Daddy Yankee, meanwhile, posted a picture of Maduro with a big red cross over it on Instagram. ?That you illegally appropriate a song (Despacito) does not compare with the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela. Your dictatorial regime is a joke, not only for my Venezuelan brothers, but for the entire world,? he said. ?With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal.? Millions of Venezuelans have been staging months of protests against Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader narrowly elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez in 2013. Some 100 people have died in the unrest, which has further hammered an imploding economy that is running short of food and medicine.

On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left.This buggy has interesting history at its tail. Here's where it comes from:WHERE DID THE BUGGY COME FROM?The gold-plated, horse-drawn buggy originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. How it remained in India after Independence is a story that will make many happy.After the partition, both India and Pakistan wanted the fancy buggy, and there was no longer a higher power to sort this quarrel. So, what did they do to sort the dispute?Simple. They did what cricket captains do these days. They tossed.Lt Col Thakur Govind Singh from India and Pakistan Army's Sahabzada Yaqub Khan let the responsibility of the buggy ownership rest on a coin.Guess who won the toss?Of course, India did. And here we are, after all these years, still using the old gal to flaunt around our newly-elected presidents.BUGGY'S USEAfter 1984, the buggy was not frequently used by any president for a few decades. While they did use it now and then, it was properly used again in 2014 by Pranab Mukherjee.Earlier, the gold-plated buggy was used by the president not only for ceremonial purposes, but also to move around in his 320-acre residential space.",general,1573,58,70
Delhi journalist critical after being attacked in park,"A 45-year-old freelance journalist suffered severe brain injuries after an overnight attack by an unidentified person at a public park in northwest Delhi on Wednesday.Aparna Kalra ? who has worked with several top media houses ? was admitted to Fortis Hospital after local residents found her lying unconscious in a pool of blood at an Ashok Vihar park on Wednesday evening. Doctors treating her at a private hospital said on Thursday evening that she was stable and managed to speak though a blood clot was detected in her brain.Her uncle, HC Bhatia, told HT that she had received multiple injuries to her brain nerves.Kalra gained consciousness briefly on Wednesday night to tell police she was attacked, but fell unconscious soon after.Police said they registered a case of attempt to murder and that the attack was possibly carried out with iron rods but were clueless about possible suspects. ?We have no eyewitnesses of this attack. We were informed about a woman lying unconscious in the park by a visitor. But the caller had not witnessed the attack,? said Milind Dumbre, deputy commissioner of police (north-west). Kalra lives with her family in Delhi.The park where she was attacked is a popular destination for morning and evening walkers. Kalra?s family said there were many people in the area at the time, but that no one had come forward as eyewitness. According to the police, at least four fatal attacks have been reported from public parks in north and northwest Delhi in the last two years.Her family said like most evenings, she left for a walk in Picnic Hut --a park adjacent to her home -- around 6.15pm on Wednesday. ?At 7.30pm, Kalra?s sister received a call from police that she was admitted to Deep Chand Hospital with brain injuries,? said Bhatia.Kalra was taken to Fortis Shalimar Bagh late at night with frontal-lobe fractures in her skull. ?She was brought in by her sister, who had earlier taken her to Deep Chand Hospital, which referred her to Fortis. She had a lot of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) collection in her brain cavities, and underwent an emergency surgery to remove it at late night,? said a doctor treating her at Fortis. The condition, called hydrocephalus, can kill if the fluid is not removed. On Thursday, she had to undergo a repeat CT (computed tomography) scan to check if fluid collection had stopped in her brain.The family is unsure about the motive of the attack. ?She is a brave woman, but we are not aware of her enmity with anyone,? said Bhatia.The family initially suspected Kalra was attacked by people who may have tried to snatch her mobile phone. ?But later we checked to find that she had left her phone at home while leaving. She was not carrying any valuables either,? he added.",general,2743,54,70
Military veterans write to PM Modi condemning mob violence,"More than 100 military veterans have in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned targeting of Muslims and Dalits by ?self-appointed protectors of Hinduism?, saying India?s strength is its diversity, media reports said on Monday.The letter also expressed concern over alleged climate of fear and suppression of dissent, as it backed the ?Not In My Name? campaign that saw people across the country holding protest demonstrations against mob violence and cow vigilantism.?We can no longer look away. We would be doing a disservice to our country if we do not stand up and speak for the liberal and secular values that our Constitution espouses. Our diversity is our greatest strength,? The Telegraph quoted the letter as saying. The letter has also been sent to state chief ministers.The letter signed by retired army, naval and air force officers said prevalent atmosphere was against everything that the armed forces and the Constitution stood for, a report in NDTV said.?We are witness to unprecedented attacks on society at large by the relentless vigilantism of self-appointed protectors of Hinduism. We condemn the targeting of Muslims and Dalits,? the letter said.The armed forces stood for unity in diversity and differences in religion, language, caste or culture had never come in the way of servicemen performing their duty, the veteran said.India has recently seen a rise in violence in the name of cow, held sacred by many Hindus. Several states have enacted laws and prescribed stringent punishment for smuggling and slaughtering of the animal, which is banned in most parts of the country. Muslims and Dalits have been the worst hit by cow vigilantism, which has also been condemned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",general,1739,58,70

Huma Qureshi slams body-shamers in new ad,"That Huma Qureshi is a class apart is known throughout the industry. Not only is she classy externally, she's actually classier on the inside. Huma was recently part of a big Indo-British movie called Viceroy's House that also starred Hugh Bonneville. In fact, she was also at the BRIT Awards this year for the same, but did you hear anyone make a big pump and show about it? No, right? That's class, right there.But that's besides the point. The point here is that Huma has faced a lot of negativity in the industry for being ""different"". She's a couple of sizes bigger than most actresses in Bollywood, and frankly, that's what makes her so beautiful and elegant. Some people, however, fail to see that. And Huma is making a point about exactly those people in a new ad she's starred in, and might we add, is looking super hot in:You keep trying to put me down .. say rubbish.. I will keep raising the bar #DownNaysayers #IShapeMyWorld @levis_in @levisA post shared by Huma Qureshi (@iamhumaq) on Mar 9, 2017 at 6:19am PSTAnd what Huma says in the ad has us all pumped and proud of our own bodies: ""Being an actor is I think the most vulnerable space you can be in, everyone has an opinion. A lot of people make these sexist comments in passing every single day without realising the damage they're causing. Body shaming is as harmful as anything else; as an actor you just have to have a really thick hide. Someone wrote a really nasty review about the film I did, and they also said Huma Qureshi is 5 kilos too heavy to be a mainstream heroine. There are only two ways to deal with a bully, no, either you stop crossing paths or you give it back to the bully, because ultimately bullies are just really, really insecure people who basically are projecting their own sense of self worth onto the outside world.Whoever I am today is because of the fact that I'm an outsider, because I don't fit in. Who wants to blend in when they can stand out? I am Huma Qureshi and this is how I shape my world.""",general,2003,41,70
Delhi Police to get 30 new Army dogs for security,"The police department is set to get a pack of canny canines from the Army to scent any trouble in the city.Delhi Police is expecting about 30 sniffer and explosive-detection dogs in a month from the Indian Army Veterinary Corps (IAVC).The four-legged recruits will help the department deal with security challenges in the Capital that frequently receives threats from terrorist groups and has a large VVIP population.Delhi Police's special cell on Monday reportedly wrote a letter to all concerned departments about two suspected terrorists looking to sneak into the city and stage attacks.LONGSTANDING DEMANDThe police force has had a longstanding demand to strengthen the number of sniffer and explosive-detection dogs, to up to 150, in its squad.""Delhi Police currently has 60 dogs, comprising labradors and German shepherds with the former in majority. However, we are managing the security of the national Capital with the low strength and so we want more such dogs for foolproof security of the city. We have written to IAVC to provide trained dogs,"" said Rajan Bhagat, deputy commissioner of police, who's also in-charge of the dog squad.The officer pointed out that the city also hosts a large number of high-profile events every day. Such functions are on the radar of anti-national elements and so security of these venues is a top priority.The dogs could play a vital role in keeping these events safe. The dog squad, which started in 1960 with 10 dogs in Mandir Marg and Model Town areas in central and north Delhi, is now spread across a dozen Delhi Police districts and special units under the supervision of the crime branch.'DELHI POLICE DEMANDED 100 TRAINED DOGS'Elaborating about the dog squad, Bhagat told MAIL TODAY that the department has 60 dogs in two centres apart from three to four dogs in each districts. Since all 60 dogs are not fit for the job round the clock, Delhi Police want an adequate number of canines in the squad so that security personnel do not come across a shortage.""Delhi Police recently demanded 100 trained dogs from IAVC. Now, it's up to the Indian Army to facilitate dogs to us depending on availability. We have recently built a multistorey building with capacity of 35 dogs at the Saket crime branch office situated on Mehrauli-Badarpur border. It is a first-of-its kind multi-storey building in India for trained dogs and an expected 30-odd dogs would get a home there,"" Bhagat said.Apart from Saket, 18 trained dogs are at the Model Town centre and 10 at the Chanakyapuri one.Indian Army has its own breeding facility, which provides trained dogs to all security agencies in the country including the National Security Guard (NSG). The force prefers to train labradors and German shepherds because of their natural ability to adapt to any schedule and atmospheric conditions.The training periods of dogs last from six to nine months depending on their physical and learning capabilities. After working with security agencies for eight years, the canines are retired and handed over to NGOs working in the veterinary field. However, Millennium city Gurugram only has one sniffer dog to take care of a city with population of more than 25 lakh.

Mumbai police not to probe Lalit Modi money laundering case,"After India Today reported on June 14 that Chennai Police has decided to transfer the case of money laundering against the ex-commissioner of Indian Premier League (IPL) Lalit Modi to Mumbai Police, the latter has declined to probe the matter. After sitting on the case for almost seven years, the Chennai Police recommended a CBI probe and transfer of case to Mumbai Police on grounds of, ""territorial jurisdiction to Mumbai Police is legally sound and justified for effective and speedy investigation"".But according to latest reports, Mumbai Police has returned the case to Chennai Police saying that the 'FIR was filed in Chennai'. K Jayanth Murali, Additional Director General of Police, Crime Branch Criminal Investigation Department (CBCID), Chennai confirming it said, ""It is true. It has returned to Chennai. The reason Mumbai Police gave to us is - as per the law, it is not tenable."" Murali further added, ""We will be now referring it to the state government. Whatever they decide, we will follow the orders"". WHY DID CHENNAI POLICE TRANSFER THE CASE?In early July 2017, A K Vishwanathan, Commissioner of Police, Chennai had opined the proposal for transferring Lalit Modi's case to Mumbai Police or to the CBI, considering the nature, gravity and inter/intra state ramification and the parallel investigation conducted by the ED. The Central Crime Branch (CCB), Chennai had also agreed to it.In a confidential letter, accessed by Indiatoday.in, the Chennai Police Commissioner opined that ""Tamil Nadu (TN) Police have no territorial jurisdiction to investigate the case, therefore, the case is to be transferred from CCD department, Chennai to Mumbai Police, without any further delay"".Surprisingly, the state government, after careful examination accepted the proposal and accordingly, directed the Director General of Police to transfer the case to Mumbai for further investigation. The Tamil Nadu (TN) Police was also directed to inform the status to ED, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue and Government of India.WHAT IS THE CASE? In 2010, the Chennai Police registered an FIR against Lalit Modi and others, on complaint filed by former BCCI Chief N Srinivasan. Subsequently, the ED registered its ECIR under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).The case relates to Lalit Modi allegedly receiving a huge kickback in the form of diverting funds by switching TV rights contracts, cheating, criminal misappropriation and falsification of documents etc.Later, CBCID Chennai took up the investigation conducted by CCB Chennai under Section 409, 420, 468, 477, 120 (B) IPC. The probe revealed that the alleged transaction by committing various irregularities by Lalit Modi and six others, betrayed the interest of BCCI.The internal investigation report tabled by Chennai Police before the state government said, ""The accused committed the offences of criminal breach of trust, forgery, cheating, falsification of accounts and defrauded BCCI in several instances to the tune of Rs 425 crore, Rs 125 crore, Rs 200 crore and Rs 3.5 crore without the consent of the IPL governing council"".",general,3197,59,70

Rajkummar Rao starrer 'Trapped' hits the theatres,"Trapped, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and starring Rajkummar Rao in the lead role, is in theatres this week. How good or bad is Trapped? Here is our Trapped movie review.Trapped Cast: Rajkummar Rao, Geetanjali ThapaTrapped Director: Vikramaditya MotwaneTrapped Rating:(3.5/5)Trapped. The word is onomatopoeic. You know what it means. You know the feeling. You know the helplessness. So when a man is trapped in his own house, without food, water or electricity, how does he survive? Because survive he must. On the other side of this ordeal lies his version of the Promised Land. At least what he has promised to himself: Noorie and he will have many babies. While he is haunted by the pessimistic What ifs.Director Vikramaditya Motwane gives Bollywood a fantastic albeit loopholed survival thriller in Trapped. It feels a bit weird to realise that as a director, Motwane is just two-films old... even though both of them (Udaan and Lootera) were artistic marvels in themselves. In Trapped, Motwane carries forward the legacy he seems to have inherited from the Anurag Kashyap school of filmmaking. The director's efforts shine through in every frame, in every sigh that his protagonist takes, in every moment that the viewer sits trapped inside the theatre with his/her gaze constantly travelling to the glowing EXIT sign. Trapped makes you feel trapped, but not in the way an MSG film would make you. You feel every bit helpless as Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao), who wakes up, takes his first step outside his new house, walks back in to get his mobile phone, and wham goes the door.Trapped is the story of the much-in-love-with-his-colleague Shaurya, who tries all awkward proposal techniques till Noorie (Geetanjali Thapa) goes out on a date with him. She is to get married in two months. ""Arranged marriage?"" Shaurya asks. She nods. Two months pass by in the blink of an eye, and two days before Noorie is to take the train home to get married, Shaurya promises to move out of his flat that he shares with three other guys, to a new home. He'll arrange everything in a day, he tells her.A shady broker catches Shaurya trying to cut a deal with other agents. He takes Shaurya to a high-rise which is yet to have residents move in. Some court-case jhamela, says the broker. All too relatable if you have had the (mis)fortune of hunting for a flat in a short period of time in a city like Mumbai or Delhi. Shaurya moves to this new flat, the door to which needs a bit of push from the outside if you want to get in. When he wakes up the next morning, there's no electricity, his phone's running out of battery, there's no water.In Trapped, Motwane captures an entire panoply of emotions on Rao's face. Rao goes from irritation to anger to helplessness to fear, dangling between hope and despair, and clutching on to dear life. There are many close-ups of Rao's face, and he nails nearly all of them. Besides the mostly taut story, Trapped relies heavily on its lead actor. And Rao throws his lot with the film. He does a fabulous job as Shaurya, adding another feather to his already-decked cap.There's a rat, there are occasional visits from pigeons. Shot in a month and inside a flat in Mumbai, Trapped tells a tale of survival peppered with the occasional humour and a few heart-in-the-mouth scenes. Therefore when the film fails to address some basic questions, you feel let down. When Shaurya goes missing, for example, there doesn't seem to be a single family member or friend or colleague concerned about his whereabouts. It's almost as if the guy exists in vacuum. You hope for some sort of answer towards the end, but there's silence there too.The runtime of the film works in its favour. In less than 2 hours, your patience levels are fine. The absence of songs makes sure the pace of Trapped is not hampered.Watch Trapped this week. Be thankful that you have the option of opening a door and getting out. And make sure you double-check the locks before that door shuts and you're, well, you know.(The writer tweets as @ananya116.)",entertainment,4041,49,70

Anushka Sharma's 'Phillauri' hits the theatres,"Phillauri is a supernatural comedy where a man gets stuck with a friendly spirit after he is made to marry a tree. Here is our Phillauri movie review.Phillauri Cast: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma, Mehreen PirzadaPhillauri Direction: Anshai LalPhillauri Rating: (1.5/5) When the friendly spirit Shashi is asked why she is stuck with the soon-to-be-married Kanan, she says, ""Pata nahi, main to yahi atki hui hoon."" Anshai Lal's 138-minute long Phillauri could speak for itself here.Once the one-line idea of guy-getting-married-to-spirit has been established, the film hovers around, like Shashi, from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting nor of any service to whatever goodness the film has.So, Kaneda-return Punjabi boy Kanan, 26, returns to India to get married. Cue: Boisterous Punjabi family scenes during wedding season. Kanan is played superbly by Life Of Pi actor Suraj Sharma. Kanan beat-boxes when he is asked to sing by his family. Later, he escapes them and goes to the roof to roll a J. When his fiance Anu (a decent Mehreen Pirzada) asks if he is ready for the marriage, he goes ""Yo, chill."" Phillauri is pretty entertaining and appears promising in these initial scenes till the point Kanan is married to a tree because of being a manglik and Shashi, the spirit enters his life.Now once this set up has been established, you need solid plot developments to fill the rest of the ninety minutes. This, Phillauri lacks. A premise like this has the potential to deliver a good supernatural comedy a la Beetlejuice or Casper. As such, the usual direction a story like this can take is one where the human(s) and the ghost(s) slowly resolve their innermost crises by being in constant proximity to each other and this is achieved by a series of good, well-written scenes.Now, Kanan's crisis is that 1. he is unsure of getting married and 2. there is a ghost living with him. Shashi's crisis is that she is stuck with Kanan; her story arc is resolved in the most predictable way at the end and it is strange that this was not made the film's focus from the very beginning. As long as Kanan and Shashi are together on screen, for the most part, Phillauri is interesting. In friendly-ghost films like these, it is the way the human and the ghost play off each other and the weird situations they create is what makes these films worth watching.But Kanan-Shashi's parts are punctuated by an elaborate backstory that is just dull and Diljit Dosanjh is a decent performer, sure, but he is not a big enough Khan to make mediocre writing worthwhile. The period-backstory involving Shashi and her lover, played by Diljit, seriously drags the film. Sometimes, the cloying sentimentality of these portions is nauseating and these scenes jut out like a sore thumb in the middle of the fun Kanan-Shashi moments.Phillauri's concept is good and novel. But the delivery is what North Indians call KLPD. The climactic payoff at the end comes way too easily. It's just lazy writing after a point. If only Shashi emerged in the writer's room before filming began and smacked some imagination into Anvita Dutt's head.(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)",entertainment,3189,46,70
Cow vigilantes attack drivers transporting cattle in Assam,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's stern warning to self-proclaimed cow vigilantes seems to have fallen on deaf ears as a group of men attacked a truck drivers transporting cows in Guwahati. The incident took place on Sunday (July 2). According to reports, a group of cow vigilantes stopped three vehicles transporting cows and beat up the drivers on the outskirts of Guwahati. The incident took place near Sonapur some 30 km from capital Guwahati. The vehicles were coming from Tinsukia in Upper Assam when the members of the Hindu Yuva Chhatra Parishad's unit stopped them and asked the drivers to step out. The men then brutally thrashed the drivers accusing them of cow smuggling.A Hindu Yuva Chhatra Parishad leader Bikash Bordoloi said, ""These people smuggle cattle across the border to Bangladesh. They transport them in miserable conditions. We caught them red handed yesterday. In one vehicle they pack 40 - 50 cattles where there is space for only ten animals. We found some of the animals had their limbs fractured. But police remain blind to their plight and take bribe from these traders. We confiscated the vehicle and reported it to police but cops came two hours late."" Meanwhile, Assam Police Director General Mukesh Sahay assured that a probe was being conducted into Sunday's incident and the perpetrators won't be spared. However, the DGP also admitted that it was not possible for the police to prove adequate security to all cattle traders across the state and will be dealt with case to case basis. 'NOT ACCEPTABLE' Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last week said that killing of people in the name of cow protection is not acceptable. PM Modi's remarks came amid a spurt of attacks by cow vigilantes and a wave of protests.Delivering a speech to mark the centenary of the Sabarmati ashram in Ahmedabad and 150th birth anniversary of Shrimad Rajchandraji, a guru to Mahatma Gandhi, Modi said unleashing violence against others went against the ideals of the Father of the Nation.""Killing people in the name of 'gau bhakti' is not acceptable. This is not something Mahatma Gandhi would approve,"" he said.""Let's all work together. Let's create the India of Mahatma Gandhi's dreams. Let's create an India our freedom fighters would be proud of,"" the prime minister said.""No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands,"" he said.The Prime Minister's remarks came against the backdrop of growing incidents of cow vigilantism. A Muslim youth was last week killed on board a Mathura-bound train by people who taunted his family and repeatedly called them ""anti-nationals"" and ""beef eaters"".""Violence never has and never will solve any problem. As a society, there is no place for violence,"" Modi said.Last week, thousands of people across the country took to the streets in a citizens' protest named 'Not in My Name' against the recent incidents of mob killings.(With inputs from Indrajit Kundu) ALSO READ:When PM Narendra Modi ripped into self-styled cow vigilantesInstead of admonishing cow vigilantes, it's time PM Modi acted against them",general,3086,58,70

Girl covered in moles auditions for Miss Universe Malaysia,"When you think of a beauty pageant as reputed as Miss Universe, you probably don't think that those who don't fit into the stereotype of beauty will be allowed to enter it.

All that just changed with Evita Delmundo auditioning for Miss Universe Malaysia.Evita, hailing from Sabah in north-eastern Malaysia, has been in focus recently for entering her application for the global competition. While that might seem like a big deal for you yet, it is for this 20-year-old, who was born with large, hairy black-and-brown moles all over her body. Add to that a birth mark across her neck and shoulders, and you have a woman who was bullied throughout her childhood.

"No-fly rules tilted in favour of airlines, say passengers","New Delhi, May 17 (PTI) Air travellers have voiced concerns over what they call lopsided measures in the no-fly list for unruly passengers and demanded airlines should also be held equally accountable for misbehaviour of their crew. The Ministry of Civil Aviation earlier this month released draft rules on a ""national no-fly list"" for unruly passengers for all domestic carriers. It proposes a flying-ban for a minimum period of three months and a maximum duration which can extend indefinitely. The draft has been placed in the public domain for 30 days inviting comments and feedback from stakeholders. The government will come out with final amendments by June 30. ""There have been a lot of feedback and concern from the public that while there are penal actions recommended against unruly passengers, how will misbehaviour on the part of airlines be dealt with,"" said a senior ministry official. The draft was released on May 5 and comments have been invited until June 4. The ministry has so far received 25 responses from various stakeholders. The official said the governments intention is to have a balance, but added that those who gave feedback felt the draft rules were ""tilted towards airlines"". The proposed no-fly list will compile data on disruptive passengers from all airlines. In case an airline imposes a fly-ban on a passenger, other airlines can independently decide whether to allow him or her. The government has recommended three levels of unruly behaviours- each entailing a corresponding duration for flying ban. The first level of misdemeanor, which includes verbal harassment or physical gesture, carries a flying ban of three months. The second level comprises physically abusive behaviour and will carry a ban of six months.",general,1756,57,70

Gurumurthy supported the notion of lower-denomination banknotes for the country.Gurumurthy, a key member of the Sangh-backed Vivekananda Foundation, has been advising seniors in the government over ways to deal with demonetisation.His comments came in the middle of the furore over the abrupt scrapping of 86 percent of the nation's currency by the Modi government.""NO DEMONITISATION BUT REMONETISATION""Gurumurthy described the new 2,000 bills as a ""bridge"" to meet the gap in cash while it is being taken out of circulation.But the new biggest notes, he said, would also be ""phased out"" gradually.""If you introduce new currency, it takes five to seven years to fake it,"" Gurumurthy remarked. ""But before that, you will withdraw Rs 2,000 notes. Rs 2,000 note is only a bridge,"" he said.The 2,000-rupee bills, added Gurumurthy, only aimed at replacing the void 500 and 1,000 notes.""It is obvious that they (the government press) are not able to print Rs 500-1,000 notes. The only way they could do it is by printing Rs 2,000 notes.

Slowly, banks will accumulate Rs 2,000 notes and replace them with lower denomination. If anything remains, like 5-10 to 20% notes, they will say, in next one month or so, you change your Rs 2,000 notes for Rs 500 notes,"" he said.Gurumurthy cited practices the country had adopted in the past to replace old series with the new currency.""It is called phasing out. We have phased out many such series in the past,"" said the RSS leader, also a renowned chartered accountant.The government is, however, committed to moving towards smaller denomination notes, he added.Indian currency, he said, should have 500 as its highest-denomination followed by 250 and 100.""NOTHING HAPPENS THROUGH PERSUASION""Gurumurthy defended prime minister Narendra Modi for his Nov 8 demonetisation announcement, which came under heavy attack both from the opposition and independent economists.""Nothing happens in India through persuasion which is why determined action by the government is justified,"" he argued.Leading economist Amartya Sen has termed Modi's move despotic.No amount of advertising, Gurumurthy said, would have had any impact on the people's attitude and actions.Now that the shock of demonetisation has been delivered, people will move towards digital transactions far more effectively than what persuasion would have achieved, he argued.Also read All you need to know about the new Rs 2000 noteNew Rs 500, Rs 2000 notes: All you need to know",general,3132,59,70

Travel time for trucks reduced by a fifth post-GST: Govt,"New Delhi, Jul 30 (PTI) Post-GST, travel time for long- haul trucks have reduced by at least a fifth, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has said. ""A typical truck spent 20 per cent of its runtime at interstate checkposts (pre GST)...Inter-state check posts removed, travel time of long-haul trucks, other cargo vehicles cut by at least one-fifth,"" the Ministry has said in a recent report. On an average, a truck in India runs an annual distance of 60,000 kms, as against 200,000 km in the West. The Ministry said trucks earlier took 50-65 hours in reaching Kolkata from Chennai and the travel time now stands reduced by 20 per cent. This was corroborated from interviews with transporters as well as GPS data of express transporters. Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, had last week said that Indias logistics sector stands to gain the most under the GST regime as costs will dip by almost 20 per cent. The Ministry said that pre-GST, the complex tax structure and paperwork forced the transport industry to spend a lot of resources on tax compliance and deposit of inter-state sales tax. Monitoring and collection of sales tax at inter-state check posts led to major traffic congestion at these points, resulting in slower movement of freight and passenger, and consequently higher costs and pollution, it said and added, an average Indian truck covers only about 50,000-60,000 km a year as against 3 lakh km done by a truck in the US. The unified tax regime has obviated the need for inter- state check posts. This will result in reducing travel time of long-haul trucks and other cargo vehicles by at least one- fifth, the report said. ""This, coupled with the proposed E-way bill that will require online registration for movement of goods worth more than Rs 50,000, will ease the movement of freight further, and bring in more transparency to the whole process. Efficient freight movement will also boost the demand for high tonnage trucks, which will in turn reduce the cost of transportation of freight,"" the report said. A single GST regime also means an optimised warehousing structure. Earlier, companies had to maintain warehouses in every state due to different taxation slabs. GST does away with the need to have such separate warehouses. This means, a leaner and smarter logistics chain. This will also encourage more investment in the warehousing business. Pre-GST, the statutory tax rate for most goods worked out to about 26.5 per cent.",lifestyle,2477,56,70

Delhi Metro stations to get digital walls for video ads,"Delhi Metro stations are soon going to have giant ?digital walls? to play video advertisements minus the audio. The move is a departure from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation?s (DMRC) existing format where only backlit panels are used for ads.With no fare revision in sight, the cash-strapped DMRC is focusing on these alternatives to increase its revenue. ?Apart from keeping commuters engaged during the journey, the move will also help the metro to generate more revenue. In the current panel format, an ad space gets occupied by a single advertiser for months. Digital walls will give us the chance to bring in multiple advertisers at the same time and in the same space,? a metro official said.Moreover, it is also a lot easier to manage. ?Once these walls are installed, only a pen drive will be needed to put ads and information. Earlier, putting up an ad took one to two days,? the official said.Read: No Metro fare hike for at least three more monthsAround 10 ad walls of 12x6 feet have been installed at the ITO station. But the size of these walls is going to get bigger at busy stations like Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Central Secretariat and New Delhi. The walls at these hubs will be as big as 16x8 feet.Similar pattern will also be followed in the upcoming stations under the Phase 3 network. Besides, the new trains on these lines will have LED display panels for advertisements, which too will be in the video format.In fact, the DMRC is tapping even ticket counters for its digital push. As many as 148 ticketing counters are going to have LED screens to display real-time transaction details and other information.It will be first implemented on the Violet Line (ITO-Escorts Mujesar) with 32-38 inch LED screens to be installed at every ticket counter. ?They will display Metro-related information in both Hindi and English.

Bear chases 200 sheep over cliff edge to their deaths,"More than 200 sheep have plunged to their deaths in the Pyrenees while apparently trying to escape a brown bear. The bears have been reintroduced to the mountain region over the past three decades after being wiped out by hunters.The sheep, which belonged to a farmer in Couflens, south-west France, are thought to have taken fright when the bear appeared in the area last Sunday.After the predator attacked one of the sheep, 209 others in the flock panicked and hurled themselves off a 200 metre-high cliff on the border between France and Spain. The bodies of 169 sheep were found the next day at the foot of the cliff in the Spanish village of Lladorre. The other dead animals were found in France.The Spanish news agency Europa Press said bear fur had been found on one of the dead sheep and would be analysed to try to establish exactly what had happened.Although the French government will compensate the farmer for his loss, the incident has provoked an angry response from the local branch of the French farmers? federation.?Pastoralism ? which protects biodiversity and keeps the mountains alive ? is not compatible with the reintroduction of large predators,? said the Confédération Paysanne de l?Ariège.The last female brown bear native to the Pyrenees was shot dead by hunters in 2004. The French government has been engaged in a repopulation programme since the early 1990s, using bears from Slovenia. There are now thought to be about 30 brown bears in the region.More than 130 sheep died in a similar, bear-related incident in the French Pyrenees last year.Farmers on both sides of the border blame the bears for attacks on their livestock and the predators are sometimes killed. In September last year, the corpse of a brown bear ? a protected species in Spain ? was found with a gunshot wound to the chest in the northern regions of Asturias.",world,1859,53,70

"Younger generation needs to be daring, says Infosys' Murthy","From Lalit K Jha Charlottesville (US), Apr 13 (PTI) To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce ""friction"" in businesses and create an ""environment"" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy has said. For the transformation of the Indian economy, he said it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy. ""We still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today,"" Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. Murthy, the recipient of the 2017 Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in Global Innovation, was responding to Darden School of Business Dean Scott Beardsley who asked, ""what do you think needs to happen next to transform Indias economy. What is next"". ""We want our youngsters to be a little bit more daring in taking the entrepreneurial route more and more than the extent to which they do today. We have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. ""And most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. I would say these are required (for transforming Indias economy to the next level),"" Murthy said. He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, ""I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India"". Interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started Infosys. Those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. ""Today, challenges are different. But in some sense even more complex, because todays entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. Before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it. ""Therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India,"" he said. Murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. Of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. ""Respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation,"" he said. ""To be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of Thomas Jefferson, author of Declaration of Independence is to me a big honour. I will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part,"" he told PTI. The fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from India, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, Murthy said. ""Therefore this is a clear example of how Indian students wherever they are whether in India or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated,"" he said. Murthy said that Indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying.",business,3752,59,70

Undue profit of over ?1cr to come under GST authority's lens,"New Delhi, Jul 23 (PTI) The proposed anti-profiteering authority under the new GST regime will take up for scrutiny only those cases that have mass impact and those where undue profit of more than Rs 1 crore has been earned, a senior government official said. A five member National Anti-Profiteering Authority, headed by a secretary-level officer, will be set up soon to keep a tab on businesses that have not passed on to consumers the benefit of lower tax rates under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. ""It will take two-three months time to gauge whether the benefits of GST are being passed on to consumers. By then, the authority would be put in place,"" the official told PTI. As per the three tier structure -- the GST Implementation Committee (GIC) will receive complaints and those which are state specific and involving smaller amounts will be transferred to the state screening committee. Other cases will be referred to the Directorate General of Safeguards who will finish investigation within 3 months and send the findings to the anti-profiteering authority, which will pass an order in another 3-months time. ""The issues which have a national or mass impact will be taken up by the authority. There may be many small cases which would be coming to the GIC, but only those cases where the financial implication is more than Rs 1 crore would be taken up by the authority. Rest would be transferred to the state screening committee,"" the official said.

Thereafter, DGS, which has the power to issue summons, will conduct investigation and give its findings to the authority. The anti-profiteering authority, if it finds that a company has not passed on the GST benefits, will either direct it to pass on the benefits to consumers or if the beneficiary cannot be identified will ask the company to transfer the amount to the consumer welfare fund within a specified timeline. The authority will have the power to cancel registration of any entity or business if it fails to pass on to consumers the benefit of lower taxes under the GST regime, but it would probably be the last step against any violator. According to the anti-profiteering rules, the authority will suggest return of the undue profit earned from not passing on the reduction in incidence of tax to consumers along with an 18 per cent interest, as also impose penalty. A five member committee, headed by Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, comprising Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, CBEC Chairman Vanaja Sarna and chief secretaries from two states, will soon finalise the Chairman and members of the authority. It will be in existence for just two years unless the GST Council extends the tenure.",general,3328,60,70

Maha spent ?8 cr from Contingency Fund for PM's programmes,"programmes Mumbai, Mar 6 (PTI) The Maharashtra Government spent Rs 8 crore from Contingency Fund to meet publicity expenses for the foundation stone laying ceremonies of various projects which were kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last December. The projects also included the ""jal poojan"" of the Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial in Arabin sea. ""It was decided to provide funds of Rs 8 crore for advertisement and publicity for the Jal Poojan ceremony of the memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and (for) inauguration of Mumbai Metro line, Sweree-Nhawa Sheva project and new railway projects under Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP),"" the PWD Department stated in the supplementary demands for grants tabled by Finance department in both Houses of the Maharashtra legislature on the first day of the Budget session.

Case against Mastercard on overcharging 4.5cr people blocked,"A £14bn class-action lawsuit against MasterCard for allegedly overcharging more than 45 million people in Britain over a 16-year period was blocked by a British court on Friday. The competition appeal tribunal (CAT), a newly empowered court that oversees Britain?s fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to continue to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced US-style ?opt-out? collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was ?completely unsuitable? to be brought under the collective action regime.A law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centred on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as MasterCard on merchants? banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers. ?The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,? he said. ?I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.? He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the ?perfect exam question? for Britain?s CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country?s maiden ?opt-out? class action lawsuits in antitrust cases. Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out. Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses that fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together.The high court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.",general,3073,60,70

Narayana Murthy says he regrets quitting as Infosys Chairman,"N R Narayana Murthy today said he regrets quitting as chairman of Infosys in 2014 and should have listened to other co-founders of India's second largest software exporter firm and stayed on. Murthy, who had infamous run-ins with the current management led by Vishal Sikka over corporate governance issues, however, said he did not miss being in the campus daily. Opening up about his biggest regrets - personal or profession, he recounted that ""a lot of my founder colleagues told me not to leave Infosys in 2014, to stay a few years"". ""Generally, I find that I am a very emotional person. A lot of my decisions are based on idealism and probably, I should have listened to them,"" he told CNBC TV18. However, Murthy did clarify that he did not miss being in the campus daily. In 2014, 33 years after starting Infosys, Murthy bid farewell to the company he had set up with six other co- founders. PASSING ON THE BATON Murthy had the longest run of about 21 years as CEO before passing on the baton to Nandan Nilekani and then S Gopalakrishnan and S D Shibulal. In October 2014, former SAP board member Vishal Sikka took over as CEO. Murthy, by then, was serving a second stint at Infosys as Chairman. While he was appointed as Chairman Emeritus with effect from October 11, 2014, Murthy turned down the offer. However, over the last few months, Murthy has been very vocal in criticising Infosys management on a slew of issues, including alleged lapses in corporate governance, CEO salary package and severance pay to former employees. In the interview, the IT veteran termed the listing of the country's second largest software services firm on Nasdaq as his biggest success story. ""I think sitting on those high stools at Nasdaq when we got listed, when we became the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq, and borrowing the words of Neil Armstrong to say that it is a small step for Nasdaq, but a giant leap for Infosys and the Indian software industry.

Opposed cutting Chelsea Manning's jail term: Pentagon chief,"Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday said he had opposed commuting the prison sentence of convicted leaker Chelsea Manning, who was convicted in 2013 of espionage and other crimes for leaking classified information while deployed in Iraq.""That was not my recommendation,"" Carter said in an Associated Press interview. ""I recommended against that, but the president has made his decision.""Carter declined to elaborate on his view.President Barack Obama has drawn intense criticism from members of Congress and others for his decision on Tuesday to commute Manning's 35-year prison sentence to about seven years, including the time she spent locked up before she was convicted. Her sentence is now set to expire May 17.At the time Manning committed the crimes she was known as Bradley Manning and was serving as an Army private.CHARGES AGAINST MANNINGA judge convicted Manning of 20 counts, including six Espionage Act violations, theft and computer fraud. She was sentenced to 35 years out of a possible maximum of 90. She was acquitted of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, which carries a possible life sentence.The now 29-year-old native of Crescent, Okla, leaked more than 700,000 classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and diplomatic cables in 2010 while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Manning also leaked a 2007 video clip of a US helicopter crew killing at least nine men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver.

He emphasized that he had commuted her sentence, not granted a pardon, which would have symbolically forgiven her for the crime.""I feel very comfortable that justice has been served,"" Obama said, adding, ""A message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security, that wherever possible we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work, that they try to work through the established channels and avail themselves of the whistleblower protections that have been put in place.""Also read: WikiLeaks' Assange should go free from embassy and be compensated: UN panel The president said he does not accept the argument of critics that the commutation sends the wrong message to others in the military.""The notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,"" Obama said.Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Obama's decision on Manning was a mistake and called the convicted leaker a ""traitor.""Pence said in an interview airing Wednesday night with Fox News' Brett Baier that Manning's actions compromised national security, endangered American personnel and compromised individuals in Afghanistan who were cooperating with US forces.",general,3656,59,70

"Don't sledge Virat Kohli, Michael Hussey tells Australia","Former Australian middle-order stalwart Michael Hussey has urged Steven Smith's men to not try and rile India captain Virat Kohli in the four-Test series which starts this month.

But that backfired on the hosts as Kohli went on to slam his then Test best of 169 in the Boxing Day match.Kohli seems to enjoy these battles and not many teams around the world want to rub the run-machine the wrong way. England, who were recently handed a 4-0 drubbing in the Test series late last year, stayed quiet.

Smartphones can now help you finish your math homework by giving step-by-step solutions to hard-to-crack algebra equations, thanks to a new artificial intelligence (AI) app developed by engineers including one of Indian origin. The app, created by US-based start up Socratic, allows students to learn how to answer a question just by snapping a photo of it. ""Again and again, we hear that students struggle with math. Every student takes math, often for multiple years, and it can be hard to get help from parents and friends,"" said Shreyans Bhansali, Head of Engineering at Socratic. ""We wanted to create an experience that walks students through their problems, and teaches the concepts behind the problem,"" Bhansali said. The app reads math questions - even handwritten ones - and gives students step-by-step solutions and explanations that teach them the underlying concepts and help answer all types of math problems. To build the app, the team looked through countless math questions asked by students and categorised them by the steps required to solve them. Then, they wrote high quality Explainers to teach these concepts and tested them with hundreds of high school students. In parallel, the engineering team built algorithms that allow a computer to solve math problems step-by-step. They incorporated data collected from students so that steps closely match those a great teacher or tutor would provide to a student.",general,1474,60,70

iPhones worth ?3.8 crore stolen from moving truck,"Dutch police have arrested five men suspected of stealing ?500,000 (£448,000) of iPhones in a dangerous late-night heist from a moving truck akin to action scenes from Fast and Furious.Dutch police said that the five men, aged from 33 to 43 and all from Romania, allegedly raided a delivery truck full of iPhones on the A73 highway near Horst on the night of 24 July. Using a modified van, they drove close enough to the back of the truck to allow one of the suspects to climb onto it and break in through the doors while it was being driven down the road.The suspect then passed boxes of Apple?s iPhone from the delivery truck into the modified van through a hole in its roof.Dutch police spokesman Ed Kraszewski said that officers had long been investigating thefts from trucks but had remained sceptical that such a heist could be pulled off. Not any more.Kraszewski said: ?The truck was taking its freight from A to B and did not stop. Even so, [the phones] were gone. So it must have happened that way.

"Govt scraps Bengaluru's ?1,761 cr steel flyover project","Bowing to pressure from citizens and green activists, the Karnataka government today abandoned the controversial steel flyover project in the city, saving about 800 trees from facing the axe.""The steel flyover will not be constructed as the project has been cancelled,"" Bengaluru Development Minister KJ George said.The Chennai bench of the National Green Tribunal on October 28, 2016 stayed the 6.9-km project from Chalukya Circle in the city centre to Hebbal junction in the northern suburb, connecting the international airport road at Devanahalli and National Highway 4 towards Hyderabad.The state-run Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) was the nodal agency for the Rs 1,761-crore project and engineering and construction major L&T was to execute it, as its lowest bidder in a global tender.The expensive six-lane project, ostensibly meant to ease the gridlock on the busy thoroughfare, faced vehement opposition from civic society and urban experts as it would have resulted in the loss of about 800 trees and their green canopy en-route to the city's outskirts.State's former Additional Chief Secretary VBalasubramanian and Citizens Action Forum President N.S. Mukunda jointly filed the writ petition before the Tribunal against the BDA from executing the project as it would have caused environmental damage to the garden city.The Tribunal bench, headed by Justice M Chokalingam and expert member PS Rao, passed an interim order, restraining the state government from going ahead with the project till the petitioners' concerns were heard and addressed.""Neither the state government nor BDA considered alternative routes, no study was done to confirm if the steel bridge was the best option, no permission was taken to cut 800 trees and no public hearings were conducted before awarding the project to a private firm,"" claimed the petitioners then.",general,1858,55,70

India should lower tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorbikes: US,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, Mar 23 (PTI) If India lowers the 100 per cent tariffs imposed on the popular American Harley Davidson motorcycles it could result in more foreign investments in the country, a top White House trade official has argued. ""If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more,"" Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal. ""Truly fair and reciprocal trade between the US and its trading partners, rather than the perpetual turn of the screw we receive now, will lead to a thousand similar kinds of adjustments as our bilateral trade deficits fall and savings and investment patterns adjust,"" Navarro added in the letter published yesterday. He wrote the letter in response to the debate that his op-ed piece on March 6 in the daily had generated. He had argued that if the US uses leverage as the worlds largest market to ""persuade"" India to reduce its ""notoriously high tariffs"" America will surely sell more Harleys there. India imposes a 100-per cent import duty on the Amercian motorbikes, popular for a customisation that gave rise to the chopper-style motorcycles.",world,1295,60,70
I will shave off my beard: Modi lookalike after AIB meme,"A resident of Kerala, MP Ramachandran was used to the attention he attracted for being a lookalike of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Often stopped at railway stations and bus stops by strangers with requests for selfies, he readily obliged. But not anymore.Ever since the Mumbai-based comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) used his photograph alongside a morphed picture of Modi with dog?s ears and a snout superimposed, triggering a controversy, Ramachandran, 61, has grown tired of his resemblance with the prime minister.?I will shave off my beard next week,? he said on Saturday. His grey beard gone, he hopes he will not make heads turn anymore. ?People are misusing my picture. This has been happening for a while,? he told HT from Bengaluru, where his son works.The photograph of him peering into a mobile while waiting for a train to Bengaluru was taken at the railway station of his hometown Payyanur earlier this week. With his grey hair and beard, he looked uncannily similar to the prime minister and the photograph went viral on social media.The photograph was picked up thereafter by the AIB for taking a crack at the prime minister. They used Ramachandran?s photograph alongside a picture of Modi?s face with the Snapchat dog filter, using the hashtag #Wanderlust.Not many found it funny and the Mumbai cyber police on Friday filed an FIR against AIB co-founder Tanmay Bhat for ?insulting? Modi.However, Ramachandran, now retired after having worked in the Gulf for several years, insists he is an ardent fan of Modi. ?He (Modi) is an able administrator. For the first time we feel someone is in charge,? he said.Ramachandran has firsthand knowledge of Modi?s strong connect with ordinary people. The first time he was stopped was two years ago when he was waiting for a train to Jammu. ?A boy approached me to click a picture. There were army personnel around and they jostled with each other to pose for pictures with me. The picture frenzy ended up delaying the train?s departure by nearly 20 minutes. I also heard chants of Modiji zindabad,? he recalled.Incidentally, Ramachandran is not the only Modi doppelganger. Vikas Mahante from Mumbai?s Malad locality too hit the headlines for his uncanny resemblance to the PM. Another who sees himself as a Modi lookalike, Abhinandan Pathak, even jumped into the poll fray from Varanasi ? incidentally, against the BJP.

World's oldest known crocodile eggs discovered in Portugal,"London, Mar 10 (PTI) The worlds oldest known crocodile eggs laid some 152 million years ago have been discovered in the cliffs of Portugal. The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the ""mother croc"" that laid them, researchers said. They are similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles, suggesting crocodile eggs have changed little in shape in the last 150 million years. Palaeontologists say the prehistoric crocodile ancestor would have spanned two metres, based on the size of the larger eggs. ""The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far,"" said Joao Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. ""This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years,"" said Russo.

Armstrong couldn't afford insurance before his moon mission,"Artefacts from the history of space exploration went under the hammer yesterday at an auction in New York. Auctioneers Bonhams presented nearly 400 lots, including many that were used on the surface of the moon. The auction coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch, with over 50 items from that mission on sale. These included the star chart used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to determine their position on the lunar surface, which went for $218,000. The chart comprises two rotating plastic discs 9 inches across, and a velcro patch on the back containing traces of lunar dust.In a letter accompanying the chart, Aldrin called it ""the single most critical navigational device we used while on the moon.""Other high-ticket items were the flight joystick from Falcon ? the lunar module of Apollo 15 ? and a mission checklist that lunar explorers on Apollo 16 attached to their wrist. The checklist was intended to guide astronauts John Young and Charles Duke through their mission on the lunar surface, but Nasa engineers couldn't help inserting a few cartoons. One page depicts an astronaut's close encounter with a nude woman; another captioned ""Looks Bad, Feels Good"" shows Young on the lunar surface, blocking the view of a TV camera with his hand. Both items sold for $206,000.Not everything was astronomically priced, however, so there were a few bargains to be had. Two lots of charts marking the orbital paths of Apollo 14 over the Earth and moon sold for $112 apiece. A couple of crew emblems from the 1970s space station Skylab sold for the same price. Although most lots went, a few failed to attract any bidders. A dust brush from the personal collection of Fred Haise, who flew on the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, did not find a buyer. Despite being coated with lunar dust, having been used to clean camera lenses during Apollo 14, no one was prepared to pay the asking price of $125,000?175,000.Some artefacts provide a glimpse into the minds of the men who flew to the moon. Having failed to obtain life insurance for their dangerous mission, Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins signed a set of envelopes featuring the Apollo 11 crew emblem. They hoped that in the event of their demise the envelopes could be sold as a means of financial support for their families.Aldrin offered his own envelopes for sale in the auction, bringing in a total of $15,860.The full catalogue of lots sold in yesterday's Apollo auction at Bonhams can be viewed online (pdf) along with the prices fetched. If you want a piece of Nasa history of your very own, another auction is being held tomorrow in London. International Autograph Auctions will be offering up a variety of space memorabilia, including the flight suit worn by Collins during Apollo 11 which is estimated to be worth £7,000-10,000.",science,2818,59,70
"HC asks Centre to act against BJP, Cong in funding case","against parties New Delhi, Jul 20 (PTI) The Delhi High Court today granted six weeks to the Centre to comply with its 2014 order directing action against political parties violating foreign funding norms.

The court fixed the matter for further hearing on December 5. The lawyer appearing for the Centre submitted that more time was required for compliance as the record was voluminous. The court had on March 21 this year issued notice to the Centre on a contempt plea alleging the government took no action against political parties violating foreign funding norms despite the court order. It had sought response on whether action would be taken against them under the relevant law.

Delhi HC refuses AAP's request for use of paper trail EVMs,"The Delhi high court on Tuesday declined Aam Aadmi Party?s request to use second-generation EVMs with paper trail in the April 23 civic polls in the national capital.Justice AK Pathak refused immediate relief to the ruling party, saying that ?nothing can be done at the eleventh hour?. ?We cannot stay the election nor pass an order to use electronic voting machines which are not there,? the court said while seeking a response from the Election Commission of India and the Delhi State Election Commission by Friday, the next date of hearing.The AAP and its candidate Mohammad Tahir Hussain have approached the high court for using second-generation EVMs attached with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the elections to the capital?s three municipal corporations.The court?s order came after State Election Commission counsel Sumeet Pushkarna opposed the plea on the ground that the MCD elections are slated for April 23 and changing all EVMs with VVPAT is not feasible in four days.The counsel said the EVMs to be used in the civic polls are the same that were used in 2015 assembly elections, after which the AAP came to power. ?But now they have speculation that these machines are tampered with. There are three judgements that elections at this stage cannot be stalled,? he added.Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the AAP and Hussain, contended that the poll panel was duty-bound to use the VVPAT-linked EVMs, adding that the Supreme Court in 2013 termed the second-generation EVMs as the ?safest?.Jaising said the EVMs compatible with VVPATs were used in Uttar Pradesh and Goa polls and the Election Commission of India has 13,000, apart from additional 3,000, second-generation EVMs with them.Raising concern over the EVM security, Jaising said: ?There is a demonstrable problem in Dholpur in Rajasthan -- no matter what button you press, the vote will go to the BJP.?The VVPAT is connected with EVMs and dispenses paper proof so that voters can verify that their vote has been cast correctly.

India changes its four-decade-old definition of blindness,"India has changed its over four-decade-old definition of blindness, bringing it in line with the WHO criteria, a step that would drastically bring down the number of people considered ""blind"" in the country.According to the new definition, a person who is unable to count fingers from a distance of three metres would be considered ""blind"" as against the earlier stipulation of six metres, which was adopted in 1976.The aim of revising the definition is also to be able to generate data which can be compared with global estimates and achieve the WHO goal of reducing the blindness prevalence of India to 0.3 per cent of the total population by 2020. The notification in this regard has been issued by the Union Health Ministry.Going by the new definition, the population of blind people in India will reduce from 1.20 crore (as per National Blindness survey 2007 data) to 80 lakh.""Because of the earlier definition, we were projecting a higher figure of blind people from India at any international forum, presenting ourselves in poor light.""Also, the data that we generated under the programme could not be compared with the global estimates as other countries were following the WHO definition,"" said Dr Promila Gupta, Deputy Director General of National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB).Further, India has to achieve the goal set by the WHO which recommends reducing the prevalence of blindness to 0.3 per cent by 2020 to achieve the elimination of avoidable blindness.""It would have been extremely difficult to achieve the WHO goal using the earlier NPCB definition since we had been addressing an extra 4 million (40 lakh) individuals blind due to refractive errors. Whereas, by adopting the blindness criteria of WHO, India now can achieve the goal,"" said Professor Praveen Vashist, in-charge Community Ophthalmology at Dr R P Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Also, the name of the scheme, 'National Programme for Control of Blindness' has been changed to 'The National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment'.""The programme, henceforth, will not only focus on the blind persons but also those with some kind of visual impairment. With the change in nomenclature, the number of beneficiaries will now increase to 40 million,"" Dr Vashist added.The previous definition of blindness was adopted at the time of the inception of the NPCB in 1976.""The probable reason for keeping 6 metres as the cut off distance for defining blindness in India was to include economic blindness cases which referred to a level of blindness which prevents an individual to earn his or her wages.""In contrast, the WHO definition adopts a criteria for blindness that is which hampers the routine social interaction of a person (social blindness),"" Gupta said.",general,2773,57,70
Fatwa against Muslim minister for chanting 'Jai Shri Ram',"A Muslim cleric on Sunday issued a ?fatwa? against newly appointed Bihar minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Khurshid alias Firoz Ahmad for chanting Jai Shri Ram, saying his marriage would be terminated for his ?mistake?.An MLA from Sikta in West Champaran, Ahmad shouted the slogan, normally associated with BJP supporters, outside the Bihar assembly on Friday after chief minister Nitish Kumar won the trust vote he faced after breaking ties with the RJD-Congress alliance and joining hands with the BJP.The fatwa, or a decree, against the only Muslim minister in Kumar?s new cabinet was issued by Mufti Sohail Quasmi of Imarat Shariah, which describes itself as a socio-religious organisation active in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.?Islam teaches respect for all religions. If by saying Jai Shri Ram I can do some good for the Muslims, why is there such a hue and cry,? Ahmad, who has been given charge of minority welfare and sugarcane industries, told mediapersons.He would not be cowed down by such threats, he said.The minister later apologised for his statement, while talking to a TV channel.?The CM told me if anybody felt hurt by my statement, I should apologise. My intention was not to hurt anyone. I have come to serve the people. My statement was distorted,? he told the channel after coming out of a review meeting of the minority welfare department with chief minister Nitish Kumar.However, his phone was switched off when HT tried to contact himUpset over the slogan hailing Hindu god Ram, Quasmi said Ahmad?s marriage would be terminated and he would have to perform the nikah again after accepting his ?mistake?.Imarat Shariah general secretary Anisurrehman said the organisation had not issued a fatwa but it could be a personal opinion of Quasmi.?I have not talked to him. I will try to find out what made him speak like this,? he said.HT tried to reach Quasmi for comments but his phone was switched off.?A Muslim is honest to his conscience. What wrong have I done? I have not divorced my wife. I don?t know how the fatwa was issued and for what,? said the minister.The BJP came out in his defence. ?Any fatwa on such issues is against the spirit and rich tradition of India, which has always epitomised diversity and respect for each other?s religion,? Bihar BJP spokesman Azfar Shamshi said.Ahmad had taken forward the Indian tradition while the fatwa was against it. ?The days are gone when Muslims were waylaid on sentimental issues. Now, they want solutions to their core issues,? he said.Maryada Purushottam Ram was known as Imam-e-Hind (an ideal person), he said, adding Indonesia, which has the world?s highest number of Muslims, had named its national carrier named Garuda while several building were named Ramayan.In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the mount of Lord Vishnu. Ram is an incarnation of Vishnu.?It is the spirit of Ram that is important and there is no need to fan sentiments,? Shamshi said.India has always been as a country of Ram and Raheem and there should not be any effort to create a divide, JD-U spokesman Neeraj Kumar said.?Gandhi ji talked of Ram and Raheem in the same breath. Former president APJ Abdul Kalam observed both Ramazan and Navratra. Ahmad has just reflected the ?Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of the country,? he said.As part of the so-called grand alliance, Nitish Kumar had worked hard to woo the Muslim community and his decision to join hands with the BJP is unlikely to go down well it.His decision to go with the RJD and the Congress to oppose the ?communal agenda? of the BJP saw the minority community support him in 2015 state election.

Maharashtra approves bank guarantees for 4 Metro projects,"In a boost to the Mumbai Metro, the Maharashtra government on Sunday approved bank guarantees and loan-related sanctions for four projects ? Metro 2A ( Dahisar to DN Nagar), Metro 2B ( DN Nagar-Bandra-Mankhurd), Metro 4 (Wadala Ghatkopar Mulund Kasaravadavali) and Metro 7 covering (Dahisar East-Andheri East). The cabinet also allowed the use of a plot reserved for playground to build an underground station for Metro 3. These decisions were cleared in the cabinet meeting held on Sunday, on the eve of the monsoon session of the Maharashtra legislature.The state cabinet approved bank guarantee for Metro 4 being funded by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It has further decided to provide a debt sustainability certificate (DSC) to three other Metro projects ? Metro 2A, 2B and 7 being funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The cost of Metro 4 is Rs14,549 crore, while the cost of the rest of the three projects is Rs6,410 crore, Rs10,986 crore and Rs6,208 crore respectively. The DSC is mandatory to sanction externally aided projects that are to get funding from multilateral agencies like the ADB and World Bank. The bank guarantees and the debt sustainability certificates from the state government to the Metro projects will help formalise loan agreements for four of the Metro corridors with international funding agencies. Only after the loan agreements are inked, one can say the financing of these projects is complete. This will also ensure that work on the Metro projects is not held up for want of money.?We plan to complete Metro 7 and Metro 2A by the 2019 Assembly elections. While civil work is being funded by the MMRDA, financing for the rolling stock, signaling systems etc is possible only through the loan. So formalising these loan agreements is important for us,?? said a senior state government official. For the fully underground Metro 3 project, a 554-sqm plot located at Tardeo currently reserved as a playground was required to develop an underground ?Grant Road? station. As the plot was reserved for a playground, it required the government?s approval to build an underground station. The cabinet approved the proposal speeding up work on the Metro 3 corridor as well. This corridor is likely to be completed by 2020-21. Metro-3 is a 33.5-km underground corridor that will link Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ in Andheri (East). The length of the corridor is marked with 27 key stations and except one all its stations will be underground. The cost of the project is Rs23,136 crore.ReadMumbai metro-3: Shiv Sena rejects BJP?s proposal to give 4,000 sqm plot at Andheri",general,2600,57,70
Note ban sucked in cash like a vacuum cleaner: IMF official,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 24 (PTI) Indias demonetisation led to huge cash shortages that have ""adversely affected"" consumption and like a ""vacuum cleaner"" it sucked in cash and then was slowly replacing the currency, a senior IMF official has said. ""Youve heard about so-called helicopter drops of money with unconventional monetary policies, so one way to characterise this demonetisation initiative is as a vacuum cleaner,"" Paul A Cashin, Assistant Director in the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department, and mission chief of India, told PTI. ""Its sucking in cash, withdrawing it from the economy, and then the vacuum cleaner is going in reverse, slowly replacing cash but as I said, at a fairly modest pace. Thats led to a lot of cash shortages that have adversely affected consumption,"" Cashin said in response to a question as the IMF released its annual country-report on India. Given the shortage of cash in the market, IMF in its report urged the Indian Government to continue to enhance the supply of new banknotes, and if needed consider extending or expanding targeted temporary exemptions, including on use of old banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas. ""While the financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency exchange initiative,"" the IMF said. IMF said the repercussions from Indias currency exchange initiative will likely persist through the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.6 per cent in FY2016/17 and then rebound to 7.2 per cent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions (primarily to private consumption) caused by cash shortages accompanying the currency exchange initiative.",general,1902,59,70

HC stays criminal proceedings against SRK in stampede case,"The Gujarat High Court today put an interim stay on criminal proceedings against superstar Shah Rukh Khan for his alleged culpability in triggering a melee at Vadodara railway station early this year while promoting his film Raees, during which a man had died of heart attack.The superstar was granted the relief by Justice A J Desai (rpt A J Desai), who also stayed the Vadodara court summons to him, seeking his presence before it on July 23 to answer the charges of his culpability in the case.Khan?s lawyer apprised the court of the case and pleaded that he was not responsible for the ruckus that was created at the Vadodara railway station on January 23 upon the arrival of the August Kranti Express on which he was travelling to promote the movie.After granting an interim stay on proceedings against Khan, the high court fixed September 25 as the next date to hear his plea.

"Polish man killed by 'superman punch' from teen, court hears","A boy killed an eastern European man with a ?superman punch? that caused him to fall and hit his head on the ground, a court has heard. The boy, now 16, who was 15 at the time of the alleged attack and cannot be named for legal reasons, denies the manslaughter of Arkadiusz Jó?wik, 40, from Poland.Jó?wik was knocked unconscious outside a row of takeaway shops in Harlow, Essex, in August last year, and later died in hospital from head injuries. He had been drinking with two friends and had just bought a pizza when he was set upon. On Tuesday, Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, told Chelmsford crown court: ?The prosecution does not say that [the boy] thought for a moment that what he did would result in the death of a man. ?However, we say he moved deliberately around the back of Mr Jó?wik to take him by surprise and to hit him from behind. ?[He] jumped up from the ground, using the whole force of his body to hit Mr Jó?wik to his head. From what looks to be like a ?superman punch? that he threw, he must have intended to send the man to the ground.? The defendant sat with his parents at the back of the courtroom, and the judge, Patricia Lynch, and barristers sat without their wigs and robes due to his age. Cottage said Jó?wik had been drinking vodka with his friend Radek Koscelski and they were both ?speaking loudly and appeared to be drunk and smelled of alcohol?. She said a third friend, Jakub Lusiecki, drank beer and ?appeared to be sober?. The three men sat on a bench near a group of teenagers with bikes, including the defendant, who had been there for most of the day, Cottage said. The attention of the Polish men was drawn to the group of teenagers, she continued, as ?something was kicked or thrown close to them? in the Stow shopping precinct. ?There was some laughter about their English and one of the teenagers was cycling around the group,? Cottage said, adding that Koscelski ?was swaying and drunk and may have been argumentative, offering to fight?, but made no physical contact. Cottage said two boys cycled close to Koscelski and Jó?wik, which ?seemed to spark a disagreement? between the two groups. Showing CCTV footage to jurors, she said it appeared that Koscelski tripped over his own feet, then the defendant ?appears to jump in the air and swing his arm with force to the head of Mr Jó?wik?. Some members of Jó?wik?s family, who were in court, left the room as the CCTV footage was shown. Blood alcohol tests on Jó?wik showed he was around ?twice over the legal limit to drive?, Cottage said. ?Mr Koscelski was clearly very drunk and the deceased Mr Jó?wik was also drunk, but the prosecution says there was no need for violence to be offered to either man. We say he was not aggressive to the group and certainly not [the defendant].?For whatever reason, maybe even just immature bravado, the prosecution say [he] took a deliberate decision to use unlawful violence when he went around the back of the group to punch Mr Jó?wik.?In a police video interview shown to the jury, a teenage boy who was in the group with the defendant on the night said two Polish men approached them. ?Both of them were saying ?Fight me?,? he said. Asked by the detective how he felt when they came over, the boy replied: ?I felt scared because they were quite big and tall. I didn?t know why they came over asking for a fight.? Asked if he heard any comments made about the Polish language, he replied: ?No.? Further asked if he had heard any derogatory comments about the men based on them being Polish, he said he was not aware of any. The trial continues.",general,3582,60,70
Armstrong?s bag with traces of moon dust sells for ?11.6cr,"A bag used by US astronaut Neil Armstrong to bring the first samples of moon dust back to Earth was sold to an anonymous bidder for $1.8 million at an auction in New York on Thursday marking the 48th anniversary of the first moon landing.The bag, which for years sat unidentified in a box at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, was bought by a person who bid by telephone and did not wish to be named publicly, auctioneer Sotheby?s said.Auctioneers had expected the bag to fetch between $2 million and $4 million.It was the highest-value item at an auction of moon memorabilia that included the Apollo 13 flight plan annotated by its crew, which sold for $275,000; a spacesuit worn by US astronaut Gus Grissom, which sold for $43,750, and a famous image of Buzz Aldrin of Apollo 11 on the moon taken by Neil Armstrong, which went for $35,000.After Armstrong and his Apollo 11 crew came come in July of 1969, the fate of the 12-inch by 8.5-inch (30-cm by 22-cm) bag labelled ?Lunar Sample Return, was unknown for decades. After disappearing from the Johnson centre, it surfaced in the garage of the manager of a Kansas museum, Max Ary, who was convicted of its theft in 2014, according to court records.The bag was seized by the US Marshals Service which put it up for auction three times, drawing no bids, until it was bought in 2015 for $995 by a Chicago-area attorney, Nancy Lee Carlson.She sent the bag to NASA for authentication, and when tests revealed it was used by Armstrong and still had moon dust traces inside, the US space agency decided to keep it.Carlson successfully sued NASA to get the bag back, and the attention created by her legal challenge prompted many inquiries from potential buyers, according to Sotheby?s. That led Carlson to decide to auction it again.One group criticized the decision to sell a piece of space history.?The bag belongs in a museum, so the entire world can share in and celebrate the universal human achievement it represents,? said Michelle Hanlon cofounder of For All Moonkind, a non-profit formed to persuade the United Nations to adopt measures to preserve and protect the six Apollo lunar landing sites.",world,2153,58,70
Sunil Pal accuses director Bazmee of non-payment of dues,"After accusing director Anees Bazme and his friend and associate Mayur Barot for non-payment of dues, comedian Sunil Pal is now planning to take legal action against both of them. However, Anees completely denies the charges. ?About eight months back I was asked by Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot to perform at a family function (in Mumbai). They told me I will be paid a certain amount later. But I never got my payment. And while Anees Bazmi got busy with his film, Mubarakan, Barot kept on telling me that they were getting a cheque drawn out for me. After so much of drama when nothing happened, I even messaged Anees Bazmi saying that I am planning to file a police compliant. I was shocked when he replied that I can do whatever I want to and that it won?t affect him,? says Sunil, adding both of them even said that they would cast him in their films but that too never happened. Meanwhile, the comedian-actor also contacted Cine And TV Artistes Association (CINTAA) and they had asked him to come with a written complaint. But Sunil never went to the cops because he thought that filing a case would take too much time. He therefore decided to make a video with a message for Bazmee and shared it on his Facebook page. In the video he says that he is sorry that Mubarakan didn?t work, and that its God?s way of showing justice to those who wrong others.?I made the video and sent it to Anees Bazmee around noon on Monday but he didn?t reply. So I thought I must upload it on Facebook. Some people have come to my support. Now I am planning to take legal action against both of them. I won?t let them get away like this,? adds Sunil of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge fame.Director Anees Bazmee denied the allegation brought against him by Sunil Pal.When we got in touch with Bazmee he said that the deal happened between Mayur and Sunil and he has nothing to do in it. ?I was just a mediator, who introduced them, beyond that I know nothing. Why will I do something like this for such a small amount? Sunil used to visit my Mumbai office and he was looking for work. Also I never promised to cast him in my film,? says the Welcome Back (2015) director. Voicing a similar opinion, Barot points out that the reason Sunil has dragged Bazmee?s name is because he is a well-known person. ?Sir (Anees Bazmi) has nothing to do with it. Sunil was looking for work and wanted to perform at this function. There was no discussion regarding remuneration. But then after sometime he said he wants his payment and even used foul language when I refused. His false accusation is defamatory for someone like me who is just starting his journey (he is producing Remo Dsouza?s film Nawabzade) in Bollywood. I just wanted to help Sunil, but it backfired,? adds Barot. Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,2797,56,70

Inadequate jail term a 'serious threat' to society: Delhi HC,"New Delhi, Jun 25 (PTI) Undue sympathy towards convicts by awarding inadequate jail term ""undermines public confidence in efficacy of law"", the Delhi High Court has said while upholding a 10-year term awarded by a trial court to a man for raping and trying to kill his ex-employers daughter-in-law. Dismissing the 45-year-old mans plea for reduction of his punishment, Justice S P Garg said that awarding inadequate sentences is a ""serious threat"" society which it would not be able to endure. ""It is the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was committed. ""Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could no longer endure under such serious threat,"" the court said. The trial court had awarded 10 years to the convict for the offence of rape and seven years for attempting to murder the victim, who had assisted him in getting a job and also used to teach his kids. His conviction was affirmed by the high court after he gave up his challenge to the findings of the trial court. He had, however, sought modification of his sentence on the ground that he has to support his family.

British swimmer breaks same world record 2 times in one day,"Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Monday?s second day and vowed there would be ?something special? over one length on Tuesday. But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened ? a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.?I didn?t think I was going to do that,? said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. Peaty, though, knows what matters is the title , when he will likely also be part of the British 4x100m mixed medley relay team seeking to win successive golds after victory in 2015. He added: ?I enjoyed it tonight. Obviously it?s nothing without the gold that goes along with it.?I?m going to be focusing now, staying neutral and see what we get tomorrow.? Peaty?s advantage is a huge margin over two lengths of the pool, let alone one. But he is focused on himself, having learned from experience since 2014 and winning Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic titles.?This morning I wasn?t prepared to do a world record,? Peaty added.?It was just me easing through the stroke and touching the wall. Progressing to the semi-final. It was the same tonight. I was on such a massive high from this morning and it was so hard to ignore the fact that I did a world record and try to get myself emotionally ready. I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.?Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56 ? swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio. He said: ?This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ?go on then?. I just dived in tonight and was like ?I feel good?. I wasn?t that far behind after the start, which was a bonus for me.?Peaty surfaces sooner than his rivals, but so he is so powerful that he surges through the water.Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, Peaty?s predecessor as world champion in 2013, clocked 26.54 in the morning heat, but finished his semi-final in 26.74 as Brazil?s Felipe Lima beat him in 26.68. Peaty is likely to be kept in reserve in the morning heats of the mixed medley relay, with Ross Murdoch an able deputy, and, assuming they qualify, Britain will be confident of success with Peaty coming in for an event which is now on the Olympic programme.Duncan Scott and James Guy earlier missed out on adding to Britain?s medal collection, which included Ben Proud?s 50m butterfly gold on Monday.. Scott and Guy had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the 200m freestyle as the Olympic champion Sun Yang of China won his second gold, after 400m victory on Sunday. The Britons? semi-final times would have been good enough for the podium. ?It?s very disappointing. I think I got a little bit carried away at the start of the race,?

In his column for the Daily Mail, Hussain heaped praise on the India captain before reminding England that they have five more opportunities to find a way to stop him.After losing the first ODI by three wickets, England face India in the second ODI in Cuttack on Thursday.

England fast bowler Jake Ball too had said on Tuesday that they are aiming to unsettle Kohli with short balls. Hussain also suggested that England could pay Kohli some lip service in order to get under his skin. ?I would also like them to try to get stuck into him a bit verbally because he can have a short fuse. Try to work on his ego, like teams would attempt to do with Kevin Pietersen,? wrote Hussain.Hussain had recently interviewed Kohli where the India captain admitted to being close to a very few people in his life.

The making off the film started in 2012 and will hit the theatres on May 26.""When Ravi (Bhagchandka, producer) met me in 2012, his idea was that the life of other sports personalities have been covered so there should be a film on my life. My first reply was: 'But I am not going to act'. It took me a while to say yes,"" Tendulkar told PTI in an interview.""I continue to be slightly uncomfortable (to talk about myself). That's why I have got other guys to talk about me. I always wanted to play cricket for India. Rest of the things happened around it. And when I got there, it was about winning the World Cup for India.""This film is about that. It is about chasing my dreams. My dream was not only my dream, it was a dream shared by a billion plus people.""The audience will also get to see the romance between him and his wife Anjali.""The audience will get to see my romance with Anjali (Tendulkar). How I met my wife and how we took it forward is part of film.""The biopic will show things that no one else had access to before.

The most important objective is that the fans should have something to take back,"" Tendulkar had last week told India Today in an exclusive chat.The 44-year-old will dedicate the film to to his father and brother.Tendulkar's father used to tell him in his childhood that no matter if he has chosen cricket in his life, what would matter in the end is how virtuous he was as a person.",general,1861,57,70
Maharashtra women jail staff allege sexual abuse by seniors,"Shiv Sena legislator and women?s rights activist Neelam Gorhe has called for a thorough investigation into alleged harassment and sexual abuse of staff in a district jail of Maharashtra by senior officials. Gorhe, a senior member of the state legislative council, received a letter from a woman superintendent of a district jail complaining about the incidents. The superintendent, however, denied having sent the letter to Gorhe.The Sena leader handed over a copy of the letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and requested for an inquiry.Gorhe said, ?In the letter, the woman superintendent has mentioned ten incidents where different women have been bullied, exploited and they are under pressure to keep relations with their higher-ups.?The Sena leader said she tried to verify the claims by contacting the person who allegedly sent the letter. ?She denied sending the letter. This means there is either the possibility of someone wanting to malign some people?s image, or there might even be some truth in the complaint. Either way, it needs to be investigated.?Gorhe has also urged Fadnavis to ensure the inquiry is conducted not by jail staff but by other police officials.The letter states till date, a particular senior jail official has allegedly molested at least 60 to 70 women employees. As per the letter, he also kept sexual relations with the complainant, falsely promising to marry her.",general,1407,59,70
I'd be happier to see Jhanvi get married than act: Sridevi,"Sridevi's elder daughter Jhanvi Kapoor may be getting ready to make her Bollywood debut, but the actor, like every desi parent, will be happier to see her daughter get married. In an interview with Mid-Day, Sridevi opened up about her daughters, Jhanvi and Khushi, and how they make her feel proud as a mother.Talking about Jhanvi's Bollywood debut, Student Of The Year 2, Sridevi said, ""She wanted to do the film and initially, I wasn't in favour. I don't think it's a bad industry. I am a creation of this world. But, as a parent, it would give me greater joy to see her married. But her happiness matters more, and if she does well as an actress, I will be a proud mother.""Sridevi has gone on record several times to say that her daughters are her priority. She reiterated, ""We are like friends. We spend a lot of time together. Our routine is always centered around each other. I have been coming home late these days because I'm busy dubbing and promoting the film. But no matter how late I get, Khushi, always welcomes me with a smile. She comes to my room as soon as I get back and we snuggle up in a quilt to watch a film together.""Given their close bond, it is natural for the actor to take her children with her, wherever she goes. But this has often been misunderstood, she rued. ""Earlier, I would take them to social gatherings and premieres that I attended. But they (people) thought I was promoting Jhanvi. Walking with my girls made me feel like a proud mother. But to the world, it became a reason to misunderstand me,"" Sridevi said.Talking about how Jhanvi and Khushi have changed over the years, Sridevi said that she was glad that they have a mind of their own. ""For me, they will always be kids. But they seem to have taken less after me and more after my bold screen image. Last year, when Khushi wrote a post about body shaming on Instagram, I was pleasantly surprised to see my kid turn into a strong, opinionated and sharp young woman,"" she said.On the work front, Sridevi is gearing up for the release of her film, Mom, which will hit theatres on July 7.",entertainment,2080,58,70

Delhi taxi driver returns lost bag with valuables worth ?8L,"A 24-year-old kaali-peeli taxi driver Debendra Kapri walked into the Domestic Airport police station in Delhi on Wednesday evening and opened a backpack on the reception table. The officer manning the reception desk was shocked when he found that the bag contained gold jewellery, a laptop, one Apple iPhone, a camera, 70 US dollars ? all valued over Rs 8 lakh. Kapri told him that he had come to return the bag that belonged to a passenger who had forgotten it in his cab. Kapri said that he had dropped the passenger in central Delhi?s Paharganj area and he did not know his identity or where he went from Paharganj. ?I was impressed with the honesty showed by Kapri. He knew the value of the items in the bag but decided to return it,? said the officer.Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (IGI), said that the duty officer alerted the station house officer (SHO) who in turn informed him about the matter. ?The bag was thoroughly checked. In addition to the US currency notes and costly electronic items, the bag also contained important documents,? said Bhatia. Kapri claimed that after dropping the passenger outside a hotel in Paharganj, he returned to Connaught Place area. He was cleaning the windowpanes of his Maruti Esteem car when he saw a backpack lying on the rear seat. ?I was confused and did not know what to do with the bag. I could not return it to its owner because I did not know in which hotel the passenger was staying. I opened the bag and found cash, jewellery and electronic items. I decided to hand it over to the police,? said Kapri, who came to Delhi four years ago from Bihar?s Banka district for livelihood. While scanning the documents, the DCP said, a wedding card was also found. The card had a mobile number on it. A call was made on the mobile number and it was received by a man in Srinagar. When the man was asked if anybody known to him was travelling to Delhi by air, he claimed that his brother reached Delhi in the evening to seek a Visa for himself from the US embassy. He was informed about the bag and was asked to inform his brother in Delhi about it. As the police personnel were making a list of the items in the bag on a piece of paper, Kapri stood by and ensured that no item is misplaced. ?I insisted that the list should be made in my presence and even requested for a copy of the list. I wanted to keep it as a proof so that if by any chance the owner of bag finds me and asks me to return the bag, I can prove that his belongings were safe in the police custody,? Kapri told HT. While the policemen were busy completing the legal formalities, the owner of the bag, Mubisher Wani, arrived at the police station and claimed that his brother from Srinagar informed him about his missing backpack. Kapri identified the man as the same passenger whom he had dropped in outside a hotel in Paharganj. The passenger gave details of the items which were there inside the bag. Upon confirmation that the bag belonged to him, all items were returned to him. ?Even the bag owner appreciated and thanked him for his efforts His act is exemplary and need highest recognition. I have recommended for a suitable cash reward for the Good Samaritan,? said Bhatia.",general,3209,59,70
RJD?leader close to Shahabuddin shot dead in Bihar,"Unidentified gunmen shot dead a youth leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in north Bihar?s Siwan district in the wee hours of Saturday, three days after a JD(U)-BJP government assumed charge in the state. Police said Minhaj Khan was asleep at his house at Sheikhpura village in Basantpur police station area, 158 km north of Patna, when gunmen opened fire at him around 3am.Khan was district general secretary of the RJD Yuva Morcha and was a close aide of controversial former MP Mohammad Shahabudin, a Siwan strongman who is convicted in many criminal cases. Khan?s family members accused criminal Raju Khan and his accomplices of plotting the murder.The killing sparked tension in the area with a large number of villagers gathering at the victim?s house. Maharajganj sub-divisional police officer Sanjit Kumar is camping at the village with a police team from Basantpur. The situation was tense, but under control, the police added.Basantpur police station SHO Dharmendra Kushwaha told HT over phone that a country-made carbine and five live bombs were recovered near the house of the victim.Prima facie, it appeared that the incident could be the result of personal enmity, the station house officer (SHO) said.Chief minister Nitish Kumar snapped ties with the RJD to form government with BJP?s support on Thursday, promising good governance.

Tata Steel may scrap merger plans with Thyssenkrupp: Report,"From Aditi Khanna London, Mar 5 (PTI) Tata Steel may be considering breaking off talks over a planned merger of its European business with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, a UK media report claimed today. The merger talks had been revealed by the Indian steel giant last year as part of a major restructuring of its UK steel business. Such a deal with the German steel major could potentially lead to the formation of a European steel behemoth with blast furnaces in Wales, the Netherlands and Germany. However, The Sunday Times claims that the deal may be under threat due to German pension liabilities. The deal has been slow moving as Tata Steel tries to solve the problem of its own 15-billion-pound British steel pensions scheme. Last month its UK workers had voted in favour of a new pension deal to save their jobs. Nearly 10,000 workers voted in a ballot in favour of moving from a final salary pension to a less generous scheme in return for job safety and Tatas promise of nearly 1-billion-pound worth of investment over the next 10 years. According to the newspaper, Dutch unions representing workers at Tatas vast Ijmuiden plant have raised concerns over the Thyssenkrupp pensions, which are an unfunded liability and underpinned by cash-flow from the steelworks. Thyssenkrupp is under pressure from the activist investor Cevian and recently sold its steel venture in Brazil for 1.3 billion euros.",general,1411,59,70

Kumar Vishwas's comments will benefit 'other party': Sisodia,"Delhi chief minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal has called an urgent meeting of party?s political affairs committee (PAC) on Wednesday to settle the discord with old confidant Kumar Vishwas. (LIVE UPDATES)In a desperate bid to keep party together, Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, visited Vishwas?s residence in Vasundhara late on Tuesday night where senior leaders Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh were already holding a meeting with him. ?Vishwas is an integral part of the party. He is angry but will come around. We are going to my place to have tea,? Kejriwal said after the meeting following which they left for the CM?s residence in Civil Lines. Vishwas is also attending the PAC meeting at 11 am.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas on Tuesday accused a section of party colleagues of conspiring against him and said he will ?take a decision tonight?, potentially hinting at quitting amid raging dissension in Delhi?s ruling party.Within hours of the announcement, Sisodia criticised Vishwas for speaking ?only to the media?, indicating the leadership?s disapproval of the poet-turned-politician?s public statements.Vishwas sparked the crisis in the AAP after he challenged the party?s stand blaming electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the defeat in the recently held municipal polls.A few days later, another AAP leader Amanatullah Khan ? the Okhla legislator ? described Vishwas as an ?RSS agent? and accused him of conspiring to take control of the party, led by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Kejriwal is struggling to keep the party together after a series of election setbacks, including the drubbing in Punjab and the municipal polls.On Tuesday, a teary-eyed Vishwas said Amanatullah Khan was just a ?mask? used by some AAP leaders to attack him.?And then I realised this is not being said by an MLA (Khan)...he is only a mask and someone else is speaking behind him,? Vishwas said.Vishwas also blamed a ?coterie? within the AAP for its election reverses but did not elaborate.Though Vishwas said he will not join ?any other party?, he kept his options open for leaving the AAP.?I don?t want to become the chief minister, deputy chief minister, convener of a party and neither do I want to join any other party.... I didn?t come to do this. I will take a decision tonight....?An hour later deputy, Sisodia criticised Vishwas for speaking to the media rather than raising his concerns in the party forum.?We have gone to meet him several times. Arvind himself met him and spoke to him for three hours at his house. Still, he is not coming to attend the PAC (political affairs committee meetings), and is only talking to TV,? Sisodia said.?Party workers know very well which party or which power is benefitting from his repeated statements on TV channels,? the deputy CM said, seen as a reference to the BJP.He also rubbished Vishwas? claims of being one of the founders of the AAP.?He (Vishwas) is repeatedly saying this party was founded by three people ? Arvind Kejriwal, me and Kumar Vishwas. This is totally worng. This party was formed by the lakhs of party workers in India and abroad.?Kejriwal had earlier defended Vishwas by terming him a ?brother?.

"Accused in Munirka murders held, victim's severed head found","The alleged prime accused in Munirka double murder case, Arjun Thapa, was arrested from Agra on Tuesday. His interrogation led to the recovery of the severed head of Sonam, one of the two women whose decapitated body was pulled out from a sewer on the ground floor of a Munirka building on November 25. Sonam?s head was recovered from another sewer located barely 10 meters away from the building. The head, with scanty skin cover remaining, was stuck inside the vent pipe, police said. Ironically, the police had searched that sewer twice for the missing head after the recovery of Sonam?s body. But the head could not be recovered, as it was stuck inside the plumbing vent. The police had checked only waste-in and waste-out pipes. Read |Delhi cops hunt for 4 suspects in brutal murders of sex workersSenior police officers said they initially did not believe Thapa?s claims that he had dumped Sonam?s head in the sewer through its manhole. It was only when Thapa maintained his claim despite sustained interrogation that the police searched the sewer again and found a third duct where the head was stuck. Thapa?s live-in partner, Mini Sangam aka Neha from Meghalaya, and their cook Jeevan from Nepal, were arrested on December 10 for allegedly killing two freelance spa therapists, Sushma alias Sonam from Assam and Nayesha from Nepal on November 16 and 17. The fourth accused, Govind, continues to be at large. Police were hunting for the duo in areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh bordering Nepal, after they learnt that their last location was in Nepal. RP Upadhyay, joint commissioner of police (southeastern range), said that Thapa?s arrest was crucial in the case as he was the main conspirator and only he could tell the exact motive behind the two gruesome murders. A love triangle between Arjun, Neha and Sonam, Arjun?s greed for money, and a possible sex racket merged to make a compelling motive in the murder of Sonam and Nayesha. Arjun owed Rs 3 lakh each to Sonam and Nayesha but was not returning it to them, said police.Read |Love triangle, sex ring, money behind chopped bodies found in Delhi?s MunirkaManishi Chandra, additional DCP (south), said that interrogation of Neha and Jeevan revealed that Arjun had hideouts, not only in Delhi but also in other states, where he had associates and facilitators.

Maharashtra to introduce cycling tracks in 10 cities,"The state government has planned to implement cycling tracks along the arterial roads in 10 leading cities of the state. The government has decided to take up a pilot project in these cities and later extend it across the state based on the response. The state public works department will test the project, dubbed ?streets with cycle tracks? in Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Amravati, Chandrapur, Kolhapur, Solapur, Latur, Aurangabad and Jalgaon, on roads under the department?s jurisdiction. The government has also formed a four-member committee under the chairmanship of the state?s additional director general of police, traffic, to steer the project. The committee will identify arterial roads where cycle tracks can be set up depending on the availability of space and the scope for cycling. It will also have to design the routes for these tracks and plan any other requirements or alterations to the traffic flow on the roads hosting the cycle tracks, an official from the state public works department said.Read: Is Mumbai ready for cycle tracks? Bandra tells a different storyHe said, ?Currently, there is a lack of any infrastructure for cyclists. A number of these cities have industrial areas where labourers come to work from a distance of nearly 7-8km. If we better equip our roads, even they can use bicycles to commute to their workplaces. It will not only reduce traffic, but will also considerably lessen environmental pollution.?Some of the previous efforts at creating cycling tracks and promoting bicycles have failed miserably owing to lack of proper planning and maintenance. Most cycling tracks of the 123-km network in Pune that the civic body created under the erstwhile Congress-led government?s Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission are in a bad shape. Similarly, a 13-km cycling track, costing Rs6.5 crore, in Mumbai?s Bandra Kurla Complex had absolutely no takers and had to be dismantled within five years.The state?s proposed urban transport policy, its first attempt at listing out goals for sustainable non-motorised transport, also lays emphasis on development of cycling as one of the main modes of commuting.

There were 99 personnel out on the operation. A CRPF company has a strength of about 100 personnel. It said the ensuing gun battle was ""fierce"". The CRPF troops replied in a befitting manner but taking advantage of their geographical position, Maoists succeeded in inflicting loss on the force.

The party was ambushed by a group of about ""300-400 Maoist cadres at 12:30 PM at Kalapattar near Burkapal.

E-rickshaws to get charging points in parking lots of Delhi,"To streamline the parking of e-rickshaws in the city and avoid congestion on roads, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to set up charging points for the battery-operated vehicles at select parking lots in its jurisdiction.The agency has finalised six spots where the facility would be developed by next month end. The e-rickshaw drivers would be able to charge their vehicles at nominal prices during night.The location include the North MCD parking lots near Badli Metro station, village Singhalpur (Haryana irrigation canal), Railway Reservation Office near Kela godown, Keshavpuram and Sector 11, Rohini.?Most of the parking lots remained vacant during the night. So, we have decided to appoint a contractor who will install the charging points at the selected parking lots, collect a minimal amount from e-rickshaws and allow them to charge their vehicles here,? said Praveen Gupta, commissioner, North MCD.The contractor will also be responsible for maintaining the ?law and order situation at these places? during the night when the e-rickshaws will be charged.According to Gupta, there are various reasons for starting the facility at selected parking lots .?We are choosing locations which are close to internal/arterial roads and far from the main stretches in city. The idea is to avoid jam on the main roads. We have also taken into account the demand for charging faciliyt. For example, there is long requirement for battery charging point for e-rickshaws near DRDO and Delhi University area that?s why among the six parking lots, one is located near DRDO office,? he said further.In future, the agency is also planning to open all the parking lots, developed near the Metro stations as charging points for e- rickshaws. ?This would include the six parking lots which would be developed in North Delhi on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation land. This will also help us to deal with unauthorised parking of vehicles on the roadside,? said a senior North MCD official. According to official, since the e-rickshaws drivers get their most customers from near the Metro stations, a charging facility nearby would be convenient to use for them.",general,2162,59,70
Waive Air India debt instead of selling it: Workers' union,"New Delhi, Jun 28 (PTI) An employees union of Air India today met NITI Aayog chairman Arvind Panagriya and demanded that the government waive the airlines debt, instead of selling it to a private player. However, the move may have come a little too late as hours later the Union Cabinet gave its in-principle approval for the disinvestment of Air India. NITI Aayog, the government think tank, had earlier proposed privatisation of Air India because of its debt of Rs 52,000 crore. ""We request you to waive Rs 30,000 crore and give opportunity to Air India management to keep flying the flag of national carrier,"" according to a letter the Air India Employees Union submitted to Panagriya. Expressing concerns about the uncertain fate of 25,000 employees of the airline, the union representatives have also demanded that if Air India is privatised, their salary dues should be cleared. The union members also highlighted that the airline had incurred huge losses because of ""hasty decisions and wrong civil aviation policy of the Government of India"" such as the purchase of 111 aircraft and surrendering of profitable routes to private carriers.",general,1146,58,70
5 colonies of Central Delhi to turn zero-waste by 2018,"Five NDMC localities ? Jor Bagh, Pandara Park, Bapa Nagar, Kaka Nagar and Golf Links ? will be made zero waste colonies, the civic corporation?s chairman Naresh Kumar announced on Friday while presenting its annual budget of 2017-18.?This will be done in collaboration with local resident welfare associations. The stress will be on segregation of waste at source, composting of organic waste and recycling so that minimum possible garbage reaches landfill sites. We are working out the details. In a month or so, work will start on the ground,? Kumar told HT on Friday.In a zero waste colony, garbage is segregated into wet waste, dry waste and e-waste. Wet waste is then put in compost pits and e-waste sent to a recycle centre. The rag pickers will collect all the recyclable items from dry waste and the rest will go to the landfill site. This kind of waste segregation reduces the burden on landfill sites.Experts say that 50% of the garbage generated in a city is green waste that can be turned into compost. Another 30% can be recycled and only 20% should reach the landfills ideally.In some corners of the city ? in places like Dwarka, Defence Colony, Sarita Vihar, Preet Vihar and Dilshad Garden ? residents have already taken up composting in their community parks and have been segregating their domestic waste.The NDMC has also selected a concessionaire for scientific collection and disposal of construction and demolition waste through vehicles having radio frequency identification tags. ?The red colour bins were chosen to differentiate them from normal ones. We will install 10 bins with 10 tonne capacity and 20 with 5 tonne capacity. A concessionaire, Metro Waste Handling Limited, is removing the demolition waste from these bins and taking them to the Shashtri Park construction and demolition plant,? an official said.Delhi generates 5,000 tonnes of construction and demolition debris ? 40% of the total municipal waste - every day. Nearly half of this waste, from big and small construction sites, can be recycled but end up on the Yamuna riverbed, in our backyards, local water bodies, or at landfill sites.To boost mechanised sweeping, three more mechanical sweepers will be hired by the council. Over 1,800 more garbage bins will be installed in all major roads, markets, parks and gardens.Garbage woes10,000 - Tonnes is the daily garbage generation of Delhi50% - Waste is fit for composting30% - Waste is recyclable20% - Waste should reach landfillsHow you can reduce waste?If household waste is segregated and recycled it will reduce the waste by at least 60%Segregate: Separate wet and dry waste by keeping a bin for paper, glass, wood, cardboard and another one for food and kitchen wasteCompost: Set up community compost bins in your area.

E-application for driver licences doubles in a day in Delhi,"The number of applications for driving licences has doubled in 24 hours after the online mode for payment of fees was reintroduced.While the number of daily applications for driving licences stood around 300 till December 24, it shot up to over 700 on the next working day, which was Monday. ?We received 335 applications for driving licences till Saturday. After our online system of seeking appointments at Motor Licensing Offices (MLOs) and payments was streamlined, the number of applications has increased to more than 700 in a single day,? a government official said.In a bid to introduce cashless transactions in its daily functioning, the transport department on Tuesday installed point of sale (POS) devices at all its 13 MLOs, enforcement offices and headquarters. As many as 158 POS devices have been installed, with 103 of them being activated on the first day. Apart from records going digital, the move is also going to help curb corruption and the involvement of touts. The project is being implemented immediately also because of the cash crunch that followed the Centre?s demonetisation of old ?500 and ?1,000 currency notes.?The department received 66 transactions through different POS devices on Tuesday. The number is expected to increase in the coming days when the remaining machines are activated. All modes of e-payment like debit card and net banking would be accepted, except credit cards. Transport department is the first Delhi government agency to implement it,? the official added.Even as the department aims to make all its transactions cashless by January 2017 onwards, MLOs said relying completely on online payment is going to take time. ?We have to keep both options ? accepting payments through POS devices and cash ? open for now. Our transactions range from ?100 to several lakhs based on the volume of transaction as taxes vary accordingly. So, those paying fees of lower amounts do not want to pay via cards,? said an MLO on condition of anonymity.Another MLO said there are a lot of teething problems that they were facing. ?There are times when we have to do multiple transactions as the rush increases during certain seasons. The POS machines get overloaded and stop functioning for a while,? he said.The department, however, stated it is keeping a tab on the issues being faced and is already working resolving them.Earlier this month, Transport Minister Satyendar Jain had directed his department to start accepting fees and payments in the form of bank drafts and pay orders for all transport services in view of cash crunch after demonetisation.",general,2593,59,70
Jet pilots defer decision to not fly with foreign pilots,"New Delhi, Apr 29 (PTI) The local pilots body of Jet Airways has deferred its decision to not fly with foreign pilots from next month.

Stamping of hand baggage to end at 7 airports from April 1,"Domestic air travellers at Delhi and six other airports will not have to get hand baggage tag stamped anymore. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), has decided to do away with the procedure to speed up the check in process from April 1. Besides Delhi, the rule will be implemented in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Cochin. In December, CISF had started trial runs for this but stamping was resumed after a week due to security concerns. The BCAS had in February issued an order announcing that the procedure was to be done away with but the CISF had at that time object to immediate implementation of the plan. Following this, a joint meeting was held to iron out issues. ?Appropriate measures have been taken. The cycle of security check will speed up and our staff will get more time to check suspicious baggage,? CISF DG OP Singh said.Recently, CISF had conducted trial runs in two phases at 12 airports and concluded that stamping of baggage tags could be dispensed with after certain modifications of security architecture in Security Hold Areas of the airports and installation of high definition CCTV cameras. These modifications were required to make sure that passengers could not access bags containing restricted items which are segregated by CISF personnel for checking. ?High Definition CCTV cameras focussed on the baggage screening system were required so that CISF personnel who cleared a bag could be easily identified to fix accountability,? a CISF official said.CISF had collected the feed back during the one-week trial run. ?In Bengaluru, 89% of the passengers appreciated the move, while 11% said that stamp on tag brings a sense of security. In Delhi, over 2,400 flights were covered and in some cases, during random check at boarding gates, few suspicious items were caught. We were required to fill the gap before reintroducing it,? the official added.During the trial run from December 15-22, security check areas were monitored through CCTV cameras to ensure no passenger skips the mandatory check. CISF staff at the boarding gates have been asked not to check for baggage tag. The decision was taken after the D-G met representatives of all the airlines last week. ?As per the feedback, stamping causes inconvenience to passengers. Many a times, a passenger is turned away from the boarding gate if the tag gets misplaced,? he further said.Often if a traveller is asked to open a bag after it goes through a scan. Others in the queue have to wait till their tags can be stamped. ?Now, if one passenger is stopped, others in the queue can move on to the boarding gate after security check. This will benefit the passengers and at no point, security will be compromised,? he said.",general,2741,58,70
Delhi Airport reintroduces security stamps for handbags,"With Republic Day approaching and no time being saved for commuters even after doing away with stamping of baggage tags, the CISF has ended the one-week trial run at Indira Gandhi International Airport and passengers will have to get the tags stamped again from Friday. However, the move is likely to return post January 26.Meanwhile, from December 26, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will start the one-week trial run again at seven different airports, which will be followed by similar trials at other airports. ?We provide security to 59 airports and have covered seven in the first phase. Before January 26, we want to finish the trial run and after that a complete review will be conducted. We aim to introduce it at all the airports to save passenger?s time,? the director general of CISF, OP Singh, said.The next trial run will be conducted at Guwahati, Patna, Lucknow, Jaipur, Nagpur, Trivandrum and Kochi airport. CISF conducted a review on Thursday and while other airports said that passenger?s time was said, at Delhi airport due to the congestion at terminals, no time could be saved.The trial run at Delhi airport ends this week, and will likely be implemented again after January 26, 2017. In the meantime, the Central Industrial Security Force -- the government agency that provides security to airports -- will start a one-week trial run at seven other airports from December 26, 2016.The trial run was conducted at Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmadabad and Bengaluru airports during which domestic travellers were allowed to fly without putting tags on their cabin bags.Read | Cabin baggage loses tag but last-minute checks add to wait time?In Bengaluru, 89% of the passengers appreciated the move, while 11% said that stamp on tag is a sense of security for them.

NDMC seeks Le Meridien's eviction over ?523 cr unpaid dues,"A little over four months after the New Delhi Municipal Council cancelled the licence of Le Meridien hotel over alleged non-payment of dues, the council has moved the estate officer?s court for an eviction order.According to a senior NDMC official, this is the next course of action under the public premises act (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants Act) 1971.The estate officer?s court, which is designated by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor, will conduct the hearing that could take four to five months.?They will seek the hotel?s comments, hear arguments and ultimately pass an order. If the order goes against any party (the hotel or NDMC), they can appeal within 12 days at the district court,? the official said.The NDMC had earlier ordered action against four of its officials over alleged irregularities in the recovery of dues that the five-star hotel owed the civic body.

In March this year, the luxury hotel?s licence was cancelled by the NDMC over non-payment of dues to the tune of Rs 523 crore.The four have been accused of lowering the dues amount by diluting a formula (to calculate dues) ordered by high court.

UK radio station hacked to play song on masturbation,"The communications regulator is hunting a radio pirate who has repeatedly hijacked the airwaves of a local station with a deliberately offensive song about masturbation.The Winker?s Song, a 1970s ditty by an artist going by the name Ivor Biggun, has been illegally forced on to the output of Mansfield 103.2 at least eight times in the last month.Ofcom said it was taking the incident ?extremely seriously? and its engineers were working closely with the radio station to trace and identify the pirate.Listeners were last subjected to the song, which uses the word ?wanker? 36 times, this weekend during a live family broadcast from Mansfield?s Party in the Market event.It is believed the rogue broadcaster could be using a small transmitter to play the adult theme on the same frequency, overriding the station?s scheduled programming. Tony Delahunty, managing director of Mansfield 103.2, said: ?Some people have told me that their children have started humming the song in the car. ?We have had calls from people who have found it hilarious, while some have raised their concerns, including our competitors, and a lot of people in the industry are aghast at how difficult it is to stop these people.?Speaking to BBC Radio 4?s Today programme, he added: ?There?s is absolutely nothing we could do about it and we?re trying very hard to do something about it.?We are told by Ofcom who are investigating the matter, that you only need, and this is the frightening thing, a small transmitter and if you can get near where there is an outside broadcast or a signal and you can overpower that signal [and] you?re on the airwaves.?He claimed the incidents raised the potential for a more serious hijacking of a radio station. ?This is a clown but it exposes a situation that is available for, who knows a terrorist, that type of person, some idiot who wants to put emergency messages on. It could become an awful lot worse. The big problem is you can?t catch them ??I want it to stop, because it could be inflicting a very nasty message to very young kids and their parents could be annoyed.?Ofcom said maliciously causing radio interference was a criminal offence carrying a potential sentence of two years in prison and an unlimited fine.But a spokesman said ?it doesn?t happen that often? and requires specialist knowledge and equipment. ?You need quite a high-powered transmitter to be able to go over the levels that the station is broadcasting at to interrupt their frequencies.Ofcom stressed that it is not as easy to hack a radio station as Delahunty suggested He added: ?We have a spectrum enforcement team who look after our airwaves and make sure they are kept free from interference, whether it is deliberate or accidental, and we have strong enforcement powers.If radio stations broadcast content that is deemed harmful or offensive, under the Digital Economy Act they can be suspended.

The flight, which was scheduled to take off at around 6.25pm, took off only at around 7.22pm after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the apron area. This was the first such incident in the past five years. A Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official on Monday said, ?We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken.? Air India spokesperson, Dhananjay Kumar, confirmed the incident and said that taking safety as priority, the pilot took necessary precautions before taking off the flight. ?The swarms of bees kept coming and settling on the wind screen of the cockpit, not allowing the pilot to push back,? he explained.The incident took place when the flight was to line up for its scheduled take off. The Flight 9I 867 of Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, couldn?t push back when a group of bees surrounded the twin engine turboprop. Though the aircraft?s door was shut to stop bees from entering it, the pilot got in touch with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) who in turn informed the airport operator. The pilot had to then call for a spray in order to get rid of the bees. Commenting on the incident, Captain Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert, said, ?Bees do not pose a threat to the ATR but the engineers and other ground staff who play a major role before take-off would have found it impossible to perform their functions due to their presence.? Pilots said that the bee hives shouldn?t be in the airport premises as part of the air safety measures taken in the airport. Former Indian Air Force helicopter pilot and aviation expert, Vipul Saxena, said that the delay will not only be with respect to the safety of the passengers but also for the safety of the cockpit crew.?The DGCA should take a note of the incident and ensure that they do not occur again,? said a senior pilot associated with a leading airline.",general,2187,51,70

No room for negotiations on Sikkim standoff: China,"With no end in sight to the standoff in the Sikkim sector, China on Saturday said there is ?no room? for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Donglang or Doklam region.India will face ?embarrassment? if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side and the situation could get ?worse?, the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday night.?China has made it clear that there is no room for negotiations on this incident, and India must withdraw its border-crossing troops from Doklam. For China, border line is the bottom line,? the commentary said.The commentary sought to add yet another dimension to the face-off by bringing in the Ladakh region and linking it to Pakistan, China?s ?iron brother? ally. ?India should not regard the existing situation as the same as or even similar to the previous two standoffs in 2013 and 2014 near Ladakh, a disputed area between China, Pakistan and India in southeastern Kashmir. Diplomatic efforts led the troop?s frictions there to a well-arranged end. But this time it is a totally different case,? it added.It is rare for China to call Ladakh a ?disputed? region and make a reference to Kashmir.This is the first time that China has clearly articulated ? through one of its primary official channels - that there is no room for parleys to resolve the weeks-long impasse in Donglang, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan.Until now, the foreign ministry had listed the withdrawal of Indian troops hinted as a precondition for resolving the face-off but had hinted there is an ongoing effort to end it through diplomatic negotiations.Xinhua is an organ of the Chinese government and is affiliated to the State Council, the Communist country?s cabinet.Commentaries published by Xinhua and the People?s Daily, the Communist Party of China (CPC) mouthpiece, are taken to be a reflection of the thoughts of the government and the all-powerful CPC.?India has repeatedly ignored China's call for pulling its border-crossing troops from Doklam area back to its own territory. However, turning a deaf ear to China will but worsen the month-long standoff and put itself further into embarrassment,? the commentary said.It added that India had ?lied? to the world by saying it dispatched troops to Donglang to help its ally Bhutan, whereas ?apparently? Thimphu had extended no invitation to New Delhi to intervene.?New Delhi claimed encroachment of its own territory by China before saying it sent troops to ?protect? its ?ally? Bhutan, a sovereign state which has apparently so far made no such an invitation for the sake of that boundary area,? it said.Bhutan and China don?t have diplomatic ties but have held 24 rounds of talks to resolve a boundary dispute.The commentary, however, described foreign secretary S Jaishankar?s remarks during a recent speech in Singapore as a ?positive? sign.?As an old Chinese saying goes, peace is most precious. It has been noticed that Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently has made positive remarks in Singapore, saying that ?India and China should not let differences become disputes?,? it said.?What China would like to see more are corresponding actions taken by India.?China has a will to solve the problem peacefully by diplomatic means, and China also cherishes the peace and serenity in the border areas, but the precondition is that the trespassers of India must withdraw unconditionally.?",world,3509,50,70

Tubelight won't break records of Baahubali 2: Salman Khan,"Ever since the trailer of Salman Khan's Tubelight released, a lot has been said about how the film would probably break Baahubali 2's records at the box office. Many are of the opinion that Tubelight will be able to pull this off as Salman has a huge fan following. In fact, Salman's not-so-good friend Vivek Oberoi in a recent interview said that he wants Tubelight to break the records of Baahubali 2. He told IANS, ""I want Tubelight to break records of Baahubali and become a superhit film. I feel Tubelight has all the capacity to make Hindi cinema proud all around the world and I would like to wish all the luck for the entire team of Tubelight.""But Salman, who has collaborated with Kabir Khan for the third time, thinks otherwise. In an interview to Firstpost, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor said, ""I doubt that Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, because the latter is one of the most freakish films that has been made. Hindi film-goers lapped up the film despite watching a dubbed version of it. It is because of the Hindi cine-goers that they have got these numbers.""However, the actor added, ""As long as nobody loses money, I am fine. I don't feel the pressure.""Set against the backdrop of 1962 Sino-Indian war, Tubelight tells the story of two brothers. It is after a gap of seven years that Salman and brother Sohail Khan will share screen space. The film, which is set to hit the screens this Eid, also stars Chinese actor Zhu Zhu and late Om Puri.",general,1468,57,70
Delhi Metro support staff stage protest for salary hike,"Non-executive staff of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)?have started a sit in at several Metro stations for salary parity.

The staff are sitting on the platforms with black bands on their on their arms,? said Anil Kumar Mahato, the secretary of the Staff Council.However, there has been no report of disturbance in metro operations due to the protest, so far.

We were in schedule C then, and we are still getting paid under schedule C now. Even after two years there has been no change,? said Mahato, who has also demanded their allowances be according to the same as what ?officers? make under schedule A.Their other demands include formation of a union. ?We have a staff council, but they have no power... The DMRC constantly tries to silence and oppress anybody who speaks up. We need a union to be able to fight for our rights,? added Mahato.The staff members had raised similar demands and staged a protest earlier this year too, which they had allegedly called off after reassurances by the administration. ?Nothing has been done so far. In turn they have taken action against me and other people seeking justice,? said Mahato. In letter to the Managing Director (MD), Delhi Metro, he has sought cancellation of chargesheet against him and one Ravi Bhardwaj filed for leading the protest. Mahato also demanded revoking of termination order against other colleague Vinod Shah.The staff members have now threatened to go on a strike and a ?total shutdown? of services from Monday, if their demands are not met.According to an agency report, the DMRC, in attempt to quell protest, has asked its employees to refrain from ?the path of agitation?. ?The issues raised by the agitating staff was an attempt to ?push their personal agenda to cause disruption?.

Airlines can't impose flying ban on anyone: RS Dy Chairman,"Airlines have no authority to impose flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians, and the law of the land should take its course, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien said on Thursday.The remarks came after SP member Naresh Agrawal raised the issue of recent flying ban imposed by major domestic airlines, including state-owned Air India.Agrawal wanted to know if the airlines could impose such restrictions. According to him, such an action was a breach of privilege of the Members of Parliament.To this, Kurien said agreed that Agrawal has raised a ?valid point? that if any MP has committed a crime or something against the law, the law of the land should take its course.?Airlines are not given the authority to punish anybody. I think the government should take note of it.?MPs are also citizens ... if they commit a crime or mistake, the law of the land should take recourse to it,? the deputy chairman said.He further said ?it is a punishment imposed on an MP for some crime...This cannot be done. This is not a thing to be punished by airlines?.Congress MP Anand Sharma suggested to the deputy chairman that the word ?crime? should be replaced with ?violation?.However, Kurien said if a person beats up someone, it is a crime.Different airlines on Wednesday lifted the flying ban on TDP lawmaker JC Diwakar Reddy after ?urgent? notices from the court to the government and the aviation regulator DGCA on the lawmaker?s plea against the action of domestic carriers.On June 15, Reddy got into a verbal spat with IndiGo ground staff at Visakhapatnam airport and threw a printer kept at the airline counter after he was informed that boarding for his flight to Hyderabad had closed.Reddy was the second MP after Shiv Sena?s Ravindra Gaikwad who was banned from flying domestic airlines. A flying ban was imposed on Gaikwad in March this year after he repeatedly hit an Air India officer with slippers for not providing him a business class seat on an all-economy flight.The ban was lifted after a fortnight following an undertaking from him that he would desist from such conduct in future.",general,2102,58,70

14K bonded labour cases from 1993 to Jan 31 2017: NHRC,"New Delhi, Feb 14 (PTI) NHRC has received over 14,600 cases of bonded labour since its inception and this ""anathema of civilised humanity"" still persists in many sectors, chairperson Justice (retd) H L Dattu today said. He was addressing a gathering on the inauguration of a two-day National Seminar on Bonded Labour hosted by the National Human Right Commission at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library here. ""Bonded labour is one of the worst violations of human rights and also the dignity of life. It is a crime against humanity, anathema of civilised humanity, denial of inalienable human rights, antithesis of decent work and a blot on civilised society that jolts the conscience of the entire nation,"" he said. The rights panel chief also shared the number of complaints on bonded labour received by NHRC since 1993 and said it was ""alarming"".

Maximum violation cases were reported from Odisha (9,983) out of which 9,899 have been disposed of, according to a report released by the NHRC. The Commission has recommended compensation in cases of bonded labour and also amendments to several provisions in Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, Dattu said. ""In order to monitor the compliance of recommendations on bonded labour, the Commission has also devised a detailed reporting questionnaire format and sent it to all the states/union territories. So far, the Commission has not received information from 12 states and 6 union territories,"" he added. The NHRC chairperson also said it would be wrong to think that bonded labour is a thing of past, as it can be found even today in not only agriculture but also in other sectors of employment including brick kilns, stone quarries, salt fields, lather manufacturing units and so on.

In all likelihood, Joe Root is like to take over as Test captain.A change in leadership was imminent after England went down 4-0 to India in the five-Test series.Pietersen, who last played a Test against Australia in Sydney back in January 2014 has always been vocal about making a comeback for England in international cricket. The mercurial batsman quit limited-overs cricket in 2012 saying he wants to let the younger generation come through but he stressed on the fact that he will keep on playing Test cricket.

Delhi to develop driving cycle to tackle air pollution,"Delhi could become the first city in the country to have its own ?driving cycle? and location-specific air quality management plans, which would help in tackling the city?s rising pollution levels. Driving cycle gives an idea as to how much pollution a vehicle is emitting and its fuel consumption while travelling from one point to another in a city. It depends on various factors such as road conditions, vehicular speed and engine health among others. A better driving cycle denotes less pollution. ?The Central Pollution Control Board is planning to develop a Delhi-specific driving cycle and location-specific air quality management plans with the money which manufacturers and dealers have deposited with it over the past one year as Environment Protection Charge,? said a senior official of the CPCB. On August 12, 2016 the Supreme Court had directed all dealers and manufacturers to deposit 1% levy of ex-showroom price for every diesel car and SUV with engine capacity 2000cc and above sold in Delhi-NCR as environment protection charge. The CPCB was directed to open bank accounts where the money could be deposited. ?More than Rs 35 crore has already been deposited over the past one year. We have submitted a proposal to National Green Tribunal on how to use the money. As the entire money was collected from Delhi-NCR as per directions of the Supreme Court, it would be spent solely to better tackle air pollution in the region only,? said the official. Even though several countries in the US and Europe have already developed such city specific driving cycles to tackle air pollution, India is yet to come up with a driving cycle. ?This is a very good proposal. If we get to know the driving cycle of Delhi it would help us to bring down the pollution levels by doing away with those elements on the roads which cause pollution,? said Kamal Soi member of the National Road Safety Council. The CPCB is also planning to take the help of more advanced monitoring systems such as satellite imageries, sensor-based instrument and strengthen its existing ambient air quality and noise monitoring network with the accumulated fund. According the proposal submitted to the NGT plans are also afoot to install LED display screens in some locations for creating awareness among the citizens on the rising air pollution levels of Delhi. ?We would also invite expression of interest where in research activities on how to retrofit vehicles with advanced technologies and alternate cleaner fuels could be funded,? the CPCB official said.",general,2541,54,70
Car RCs to be delivered to owner's residence in Delhi,"Tired of doing the rounds of the dealer?s store or the licensing office to get your new car registered? You can just sit back and relax now as the registration certificate (RC) for your car will soon be delivered right at your doorstep.Starting next week, the Delhi government is going to put in place a new system in which RCs will be delivered at the vehicle owners? residence via speed post. At present, people have to visit either the dealers? showrooms or the Motor Licensing Offices (MLOs) to get the mandatory document that establishes the ownership of a vehicle and ensures that it is part of the count kept by the transport department of a state. With the new system in place, once the dealers or buyers deposit documents with the MLOs the registration certificates will be directly sent by post to car owners. The move assumes significance as over 10 lakh RCs are issued in the national Capital annually. Of this, nearly seven lakh are issued against new cars and 2.1 lakh are those under ?transfer of ownership? or on resale of used cars. Besides, approximately 55000 additional RCs issued under the ?duplicate? category for those who have lost the document.\According to officials in the transport department the new system will not only make things easier for the vehicle owner, but is aimed at eliminating corruption as well. ?We were getting feedback that some licensing officers have been engaging in corrupt practices with the car or bike dealers. This system would remove the contact between the dealers and the licensing officers as all documents will collectively reach for dispatch and there shall be no preference given to anybody,? a transport official said.Vehicle owners will also get alerts through SMS about the status of their RC. Apart from this, the process of transfer of ownership of vehicles is also going to be simplified with the government planning to introduce an online portal for the same.Hindustan Times spoke to people to know if they liked the idea. Many of them said it would be much easier for them to receive the RC at home. However, some had doubts about how much time the delivery would take. ?What if the parcel gets lost in transit? Anyway, it takes several days now to get an RC. Introduction of the postal system might delay it further as it would take at least a week or 15 days to reach us,? said Kritika Manchanda, a resident of Panchsheel Park.",general,2399,53,70

Release of Bengali film on demonetisation stalled by CFBC,"Kolkata, Mar 29 (PTI) The Censor Board regional office has stalled the release of Bengali film ""Shunyota"" themed on the effects of demonetisation on the common man and referred it to CBFC Chairman for future decision. Director Suvendu Ghosh claimed that ""Shunyota"" is the first film on demonetisation, and is scheduled to be released on March 31. ""The Examining Committee has examined the film on March 27. Since there are differences of opinion among the members of the committee regarding certificate, the case is being referred, as per the Certification rules, to the Chairman, CBFC for his decision in this regard,"" a letter from the CBFC regional office told the films producers.

Addressing a press conference, Ghosh today said, ""I have learnt that CBFC members are not sure in which category they should slot the film. If they had any issue, they could have given U/A to the film. My three-part film does not take any stand on the demonetisation issue. ""While it talks about the problems faced by the aam admi belonging to different strata of society, it also points out that demonetisation has given rise to the issue of transparency in cash transaction. It (the film )has no political colour but had they (CBFC) told me to cut certain parts I would have considered.""

World Book Fair begins in Delhi from Jan 7,"Bookworms in the Capital can rejoice as the New Delhi World Book Fair, organised by the National Book Trust (NBT), India, in association with India Trade Promotion Organization (ITPO), will start on Saturday at the Pragati Maidan.The fair will run till January 15 and will be open to public from 11 am to 8 pm for the first eight days, and until 5 pm on the closing day. This year?s theme is ?Manushi?. The fair will celebrate women writers and writings about women. It will also feature special pavilions dedicated to NBT?s journey through 60 years of its existence, books for children, and international literature.Prominent writers and scholars such as Kailash Satyarthi, Hemant Singh Katoch, Omair Ahmad, Vikram Kapur and Vipul Mudgal, among others, will be available for interactions during the book fair. Photo exhibitions by the delegation of the European Union (EU) which examines the lives of the Indian diaspora in Europe, and by the Embassy of People?s Republic of China which explains the Chinese New Year, will also feature at the fair. Other highlights this year include film screenings based on Shakespearean plays by the British Council. NBT chairman Baldeo Bhai Sharma said if reading habits are on the decline in the country, it is not because people are any less in love with books and reading, but because of other factors like lack of access and high costs associated with books, according to Sharma. Addressing the high costs associated with books, Sharma said they have spoken to publishers and distributors participating in the fair to try to offer books at discounted rates. ?We will also facilitate cashless transactions and digital payments, and have made arrangements for ATMs, including a mobile ATM, to ensure that business is not affected in the wake of demonetisation,? said Sharma.The ITPO has also collaborated with BSNL to ensure better network connectivity at the fair, so that digital transactions can happen with ease.Entry is free for senior citizens and children in school uniforms. ?We have discussed free entry passes with ITPO, because it is unfortunate that people will have to pay to enter the fair, where they come to buy books,? said Sharma.ITPO general manager SR Sahoo said they were considering issuing free passes from next year. ?General entry tickets will cost Rs 30 for adults and Rs 20 for children below 12 years of age. These are the Pragati Maidan entry charges,? he said.The fares are Rs 10 higher than what they were last year because entry charges to Pragati Maidan were increased, not just for the book fair, Sahoo clarified.The fair will be inaugurated by Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey, minister of state for human resources development (higher education), on Saturday at 11 am. Dr Pratibha Ray, a Jnanpith Awardee and Odia writer, will be the guest of honour. 0Tomasz Kozlowski, ambassador of the delegation of the European Union to India, will also be present as a special guest.FIND OUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR YOU AT NAKSHATRA 2017 Visitors to the book fair can also try to find out more about their future at ITPO?s annual astrology event Nakshatra.

I am a creation of this Parliament: Prez Pranab Mukherjee,"President Pranab Mukherjee hailed on Sunday India?s democracy and Parliament in particular, delivering an emotional farewell speech at the Central Hall where he urged lawmakers to ?debate, discuss and dissent? but not disrupt. (President?s speech: Full text)Mukherjee, the 13th President of India, will leave the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday when his successor Ram Nath Kovind is sworn in.?I strived to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, not just in word but also in spirit,? Mukherjee said, reflecting upon his time as India?s titular head of state that began in 2012.The President has raised eyebrows last year when he ordered the dismissal of the Uttarakhand government.Mukherjee spent 37 years as a Congress member in Parliament, where, he said on Sunday, ?realised how disruption hurts the opposition more than the government as it denies them the opportunity to raise the concerns of the people,? the President said.The monsoon session of Parliament currently underway has seen repeated adjournments, costing of time and money for the House. Both Houses of Parliament have often been marred by protests that have delayed the rollout of key legislation.?When Parliament fails to discharge its lawmaking role or enacts laws without discussion, I feel it breaches the trust reposed in it by the people of this great country,? he said.In addition to disruptions, the President spoke out about Ordinances in particular, calling it a tool that ?should be used only in compelling circumstances?.Mukherjee shared a story about his mentor, late PM Indira Gandhi, on the importance of ?self-correction?. After the Congress?s poll defeat following the Emergency, Gandhi and Mukherjee were in London in 1978 and faced journalists, he said. ?The first question that was flung at her was, ?What have been your gains from the Emergency?? Looking at the journalist squarely in the eye, Indira Gandhi replied, ?In those 21 months, we comprehensively managed to alienate all sections of Indian people.? I learnt an early lesson of acknowledging my mistakes and rectifying them. Self-correction in such situations is always a better option than self-justification,? Mukherjee said.Earlier, vice president Hamid Ansari recalled how Mukherjee spoke about nurturing pluralism and diversity. He quoted Mukherjee to add that there is room for Argumentative Indian but not intolerant Indian. Ansari said ?these messages are important in our troubled times?. The President too, spoke about the diversity of the country of 130 crore people who, he said, belonged to three major ethnic groups, practicing seven major religions and speaking 122 languages in daily lives.?Not a single part of this vast territory of 3.3 million square kilometers of landmass and islands is unrepresented in the Parliament. Each of the 788 voices of MPs is important,? said Mukherjee. His comment assumes significance in the wake of the rise of smaller parties in Parliament.Mukherjee spoke about his association with PV Narsimha Rao, remember former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his oration, Manmohan Singh for his ?calming presence?, and recalled how LK Advani gave him mature advice and Sonia Gandhi was a passionate supporter of social legislations.In the closing parts of his speech, he praised Prime Minister Modi and said: ?I?ll carry with me fond memories of association with PM Narendra Modi and remember his warm behaviour towards me?. He praised the PM for advice and co-operation ?at every step? and added that the BJP leader is working ?with passion and energy, he is driving transformational changes.??It will be with a tinge of sadness and a rainbow of memories that I will be leaving this building today... I leave with a sense of fulfilment and happiness of having served the country,? he said, before finishing his speech with ?Jai Hind?.Mukherjee will address the nation tomorrow before he demits office.",politics,3893,57,70
Snapdeal rejects $850 mn buyout offer from Flipkart: Reports,"Snapdeals board is believed to have rejected a takeover offer of USD 800-850 million (around Rs 5,500 crore) from larger e-commerce rival Flipkart. According to sources privy to the development, Flipkart has completed the due diligence process and has made an offer of USD 800-850 million to buy Snapdeal. However, the offer was rejected by the Snapdeals board which felt the amount undervalues the company as the due diligence report is clean. ""The first offer has been rejected but talks are still on. It is an ongoing discussion,"" said one of the sources. When contacted, Snapdeal, SoftBank and Flipkart declined to comment. SoftBank, the Snapdeals largest investor, has been proactively mediating the sale for the past few months. The board also has representation from Snapdeal founders (Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal), NVP and Kalaari Capital. Sources said Ernst & Young, which was roped in by Flipkart to conduct a due diligence on Snapdeal, submitted its report a few days ago, following which the offer was made. The deal between Snapdeal and Flipkart, if completed, would mark the biggest acquisition in the Indian e-commerce space. One of the leading contenders in the Indian e-commerce space, Snapdeal has seen its fortunes failing amid strong competition from Amazon and Flipkart. Compared to a valuation of about USD 6.5 billion in February 2016, the sale to Flipkart could see Snapdeal being valued at about USD 1 billion. SoftBank has already written off over USD 1 billion on valuation of its investment in Snapdeal.ALSO READ:Snapdeal is not Snapchat: Confusion costs Indian brand its image",general,1605,60,70

Indian Railways mulls Metro-like self-propelled trains,"Racing against time to bring a network of ""high-speed corridors"" on track, the Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in Delhi Metro.This technology, experts say, will not only achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour, but also put in place advance protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking system to improve passenger safety.Senior railway officials said the prototype of the train is being manufactured at Integral Coach Factory in Chennai and the first two sets will be ready by March 2018. The trial runs will begin soon thereafter.A top railway ministry official told Mail Today that the Chennai coach factory has already issued a global tender for technical support for the new trains. MADE IN INDIA""These self-propelled trains will be made in India. This will reduce the manufacturing cost to nearly half the cost of importing them from foreign countries. Apart from the passenger comfort, emphasis will be on safety of the trains while they run at high speed,"" the official said.The Chennai factory is looking to equip the train sets with improved mechanical couplers and modern bogies that will support its movement at high speed. ""This will help keep the jerks and vibrations at bay,"" officials associated with the project said.""The train will have fully suspended traction motors, pneumatic secondary suspension and anti-roll bar. The brake system will be Electro Pneumatic, which will reduce the braking distance, so that full speed potential of the train can be harnessed,"" the officials said.The new technology, which comprises electro-pneumatic (EP) brake system, has an edge over the conventional air brake mechanism in terms of speed of control and quick on-vehicle reaction times.The EP brake takes less time to respond giving the loco pilot instant control of the entire train. Experts said it was originally designed for subways or metro trains but over the years the system has been widely used in leading train networks across the globe. Its speed of operation also makes it ideal for automatic train operation (ATO).For operating trains at the speed of 160 km per hour, the biggest challenge before railways is to modify its existing tracks. This includes removing sharp curves and barricading along the route so that trains can attain high speed without any physical obstructions.MODI'S DREAM PROJECTA network of high speed corridors is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi but so far only Delhi-Agra corridor has become operational. Gatimaan Express, India's fastest train that runs at the speed of 160 km per hour, runs on the corridor.Eight other semi-high speed corridors have been proposed across the country but these are still in the conception stage. Railways has also formed a separate entity, High Speed Rail Corporation (HSRC) for speedy execution of these projects.The railways has also started the work to convert two of the busiest routes -- Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah -- into semi-high speed corridors. The maximum speed of trains on these rail routes will increase by 30 km per hour that will cut short the travel time to Mumbai and Kolkata by up to 5 hours.As per the plan, the top speed of Rajdhani Express on these routes will be increased from the current 130 kmph to 160 kmph. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has instructed railway officials to execute the two projects on priority basis.",general,3407,54,70
Sex is just as important to older women: European court,"Judges in Portugal were guilty of sexual discrimination in a medical compensation case when they decided that the importance of sex diminished with the age of a woman, Europe?s human rights court has ruled.Maria Morais, a 50-year-old Portuguese woman with two children, claimed that medical negligence during botched gynaecological surgery at a Portuguese hospital in 1995 left her unable to have normal sex. She won her compensation case for physical and mental suffering, but the hospital then won a 2013 appeal that cut the payout by around one-third.Justifying the cut, judges in Lisbon argued sex was not as important because of her age. The three-judge panel ? made up of two men and a woman ? were all over 50, according to Morais?s lawyer, Vitor Ribeiro. The case triggered a storm of protest in Portugal, where one female lawmaker described the ruling as ?Taliban jurisprudence.?The France-based European court of human rights sided with Morais, saying Portuguese judges were guilty of ?prejudices? and had violated the right to respect for private and family life. It ordered Portugal to pay Morais ?3,250 ($3,790) in damages and ?2,460 for costs and expenses.The Portuguese court?s decision ?ignored the physical and psychological importance of sexuality for women?s self-fulfillment and other dimensions of women?s sexuality?, the European court said.?The [Lisbon court] decision had moreover been based on the general assumption that sexuality was not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. In the [European] court?s view those considerations showed the prejudices prevailing in the judiciary in Portugal,? it added.There was no immediate reaction from Portuguese authorities.The European court noted two other judgments in Portugal, in 2008 and 2014, concerning medical malpractice complaints by two male patients. In those cases, Portugal?s supreme court found that the fact that the men could no longer have normal sexual relations had affected their self-esteem and brought ?tremendous or strong mental shock?, regardless of their age or whether they had had children or not.? This article was amended on 26 July 2017. The subheading in an earlier version said Lisbon judges. This has been corrected to judges in France.",general,2295,56,70

Punjab govt cuts down VIP security including CM's,"New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Punjab today cut down on VIP security, including that of the chief minister, by a whopping 2,000 personnel and decided to deploy them to ensure better policing and improve the law-and-order situation in the state. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also directed the police to review the arms and ammunition licences to check unbridled proliferation of arms in the hands of criminals. The decision was taken at a high-level security review meeting chaired by Amarinder and attended by Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Suresh Arora and Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) Dinkar Gupta, besides Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar. The withdrawal of security also includes pruning of the chief ministers security from 1,392 to 1,016 personnel. Some 1,500-odd security personnel have been withdrawn in other categories of constitutional and government functionaries, an official spokesperson said after the meeting. The chief minister has already ordered withdrawal of all deployment along his travel routes and his security is likely to be cut down further at the next review meeting, based on fresh reports on threat perceptions. Amarinder has made it clear that he does not want security beyond the ""bare necessity"". He has also directed the police and other agencies to review the existing security policy, which was approved by the Punjab cabinet and subsequently notified by the Department of Home Affairs and Justice in 2013. The chief minister underlined the need to provide only ""need-based"" security, taking the latest threat perception for individuals into account. With the existing security policy being three-year-old, he directed the police to call for fresh reports from the state and central agencies to map the threat perceptions of individuals who have been provided security and then decide on the quantum of security. This was the second security review meeting of the Amarinder-led Congress government since it took over the reins of Punjab last month. At the first meeting in March of a committee headed by the DGP (Law-and-Order), as many as 749 police and paramilitary personnel were withdrawn from various categories of protectees. The Congress manifesto for the Punjab Assembly polls had clearly stated that the ""unhealthy"" trend of the use of policemen by politicians and bureaucrats for their personal security will be discouraged strongly. Amarinder expressed grave concern at the threat posed to internal security as a result of arms proliferation, which had led to several incidents of law-and-order violation in the state. He ordered a comprehensive review of all the arms licences issued by district magistrates and police commissionerates. Amarinder also directed a propriety audit of the arms licences issued after the notification of the Arms Rules, 2016, which came into effect from July 15, 2016.",general,2880,49,70

63% Indians concerned about leakage of data given to Aadhaar,"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea challenging various notifications of the Centre to make Aadhaar mandatory for availing benefits of government schemes.The matter has been listed in the apex court for hearing on May 17.

The same bench is currently hearing a batch of petitions challenging the practice of triple talaq.But, ahead of Supreme Court's hearing, about 63 per cent people have expressed concern about the leakage of their Aadhaar data.MAJORITY CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACYIn a survey conducted by the LocalCircles - a citizen engagement platform - about 63 per cent of over 10,700 participants said that they were concerned about the leakage of their personal data given to Aadhaar into public domain.In a statement, the LocalCircles said that ""details of 13.5 crore Aadhaar accounts were published on a website highlighting vulnerabilities of the system. Also, Aadhaar of students of some Kendriya Vidyalaya schools were found on their websites.""This raises the question of misuse of personal data by people or groups with vested interests. According to the survey, many participants questioned the security mechanism of the regulatory body of Aadhaar - the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?The LocalCircles release said, ""Some citizens outlined that vendors who make Aadhaar card have been selling information in the market.""On the other hand, the vendors enlisted their own problems in providing service to the people in accordance with the rules laid down by the UIDAI. The vendors, the release said, ""outlined various concerns including the costs that they incur to become a licensed Aadhaar operator, the high upfront equipment cost and the fact that the UIDAI payment of INR 100 per Aadhaar is usually quite delayed. Therefore it is not lucrative for them to be an operator unless they charge extra from citizens for making Aadhaar or find other ways to earn."" However, 70 per cent of the participants of the survey extended their support to the government's emphasis on Aadhaar making it mandatory for filing tax returns and linking it to Permanent Account Number (PAN).Approximately 70 per cent citizens support this move of the government while 27 per cent were against the idea. ALL EYES ON SUPREME COURTThe Supreme Court has repeatedly directed the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory for welfare schemes. First such ruling came in October 2015.

Armed with the prize and his degree, Hien worked on developing his business for two years before finally selling his first caterpillars to market traders.?It didn?t start off well,? he recalls. ?Our price ? 3,000 Central African francs (about £4) for one 500g pack of fresh caterpillars ? was just too high.?He came up with a solution the day his steriliser broke down. ?Bags of fresh caterpillars were piling up and the insects were drying out,? Hien said. ?We had to find a way to shift them.? In January 2016, he launched a new product: dried caterpillars. At 650 francs (85p) for a 70g pack, the crunchy caterpillars were an instant hit. ?We sold 30,000 units last year, and hope to hit 100,000 this year,? he says.Yelo Kam, one of his six employees, meticulously cuts labels for caterpillar bags. ?Kahitouo is an ambitious man, a visionary,? she says, without lifting her eyes from her work. ?You have to be brave to hang in there.?Hien?s venture was given ?42,000 (£36,000) in 2016 after winning a French competition that rewards social initiatives. ?The money will allow us to attend regional fairs, as well as to find markets and partners in west Africa,? he says.Hien still pursues his first passion: research. For several months, his team has been working on ways to breed caterpillars in a controlled environment, rather than in nature.?Once mature, caterpillars normally hide in the ground to grow ? a stage that is only possible in porous soil,? Hien explains. ?Yet with soils drying up, caterpillars are becoming rarer.?While initial results are encouraging, the company needs more funds to finish its research, but the road ahead does not scare Hien. ?I like taking risks. Challenges spur me on.? And he?s already thinking of his next prototype: a cricket biscuit.",world,3204,60,70

I fear for my life: RJD man who failed to defend Lalu on TV,"Sanoj Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) comradeship of 30 years failed to wane Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap's ire towards him who thrashed him brutally in a party on Friday. An RJD loyalist and worker, Sanoj had a few days back appeared in a news debate on television where he was unable to defend Lalu Yadav and his family over allegations of corruption and acquiring benami properties.

Defence Ministry scraps ?6500 crore Navy chopper deal,"The Defence Ministry has scrapped a Rs 6,500 crore deal for buying 16 multirole helicopters for the Navy from America as the government is bargaining hard on price with foreign vendors and promoting Make in India in the military sector for reducing imports.The decision has come a couple of weeks before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US where he would be meeting American President Donald Trump.With budgets not increasing in proportion with modernization demands of the armed forces, the Defence Ministry is using hard bargaining as a tool to cut down the cost of projects.""The deal for procuring 16 helicopters for the Navy has been scrapped by the Defence Ministry, after it was stuck for over two years on the issues of price, and the American firm Sikorsky refuced to extend the validity of its commercial bid,"" Government sources told Mail today here.The final decision on the matter was taken by the ministry after the Contracts Negotiation Committee (CNC) headed by the Joint Secretary and Acquisition Manager (Maritime Systems) recommended the retraction of the tender.DEAL STUCK OVER PRICEThe deal had been in the making since 2009 when the navy initiated the process for buying 16 multirole choppers for being deployed on its warships.It was stuck over the issue of price for over last two years at the contract negotiation stage but the US firm did not agree to extend the validity of its commercial offer. It is now learnt that the procurement of these 16 choppers would be merged with a Make in India programme to produce around 140 Naval Multirole Helicopters (NMRH) for equipping all major naval warships with one multirole helicopter each when they go in for blue water missions and anti-piracy patrols.On the need for keeping the deal alive, Defence Ministry sources said, that the American firm would extend the validity of its price bid and also reduce the price of the choppers which was higher than the benchmark set by the government.UPGRADING ANTI-SUBMARINE CAPABILITIESThe 16 multirole helicopters are sought by the Navy for upgrading its anti-submarine warfare capabilities, which are on a decline as the Seaking helicopters bought from the UK in 1980s, would be on their way out from the force in near future, they added.Sikorsky was selected by the Navy for its requirements in December 2014 as it emerged as the only bidder in the race after Finmeccannica was chucked out of competition due to the chopper scam allegations on it.After the tender bid was opened, sources said there was a demand made to raise the price of the choppers to meet inflation, but the defence ministry sought a further cut in the price demanded by the firm originally in its commercial bid.Other issues like liability clause were also responsible for holding up the deal for some time, sources said.Navy sources said the deal is required badly for the force as it has to find a replacement for the SeaKing - 42 choppers bought from British firm Westland helicopters.",general,2985,53,70

It's becoming a joke: Kabir on Lipstick Under My Burkha row,"Director Kabir Khan lashed out at the Central Board of Film Certification and its chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani over the CBFC's denial of a certificate for Alankrita Srivastava's film, Lipstick Under My Burkha. Ironically, the film has won several awards internationally, including laurels for gender equality. The film was also widely celebrated at the Tokyo Film Festival and MAMI (Mumbai Film Festival) last year.Speaking exclusively to India Today, Kabir Khan said that his first reaction to the news was, ""Oh god, not again! It is becoming a bit of a joke."" The man behind blockbusters like Ek Tha Tiger and Bajrangi Bhaijaan said that every two months, the CBFC had made it a habit to do something completely stupid like this.Kabir, whose next Bollywood outing will be Salman Khan-starrer Tubelight, added that the time had come for the film industry to unite and protest for their rights. He took on Pankaj Nihalani and called him an adamant man, saying that it was incorrect for Nihalani or a group of people to dictate what people must see and what they shouldn't.Infact, the director even mocked Nihalani for deciding the duration of James Bond's onscreen kiss on screen. Kabir is of the view that even if the film is not celebrated or directed by a newcomer, it has the right to release. One can always communicate proposed cuts with filmmakers, however a blanket ban on the film's release was absolutely unacceptable and a threat to our freedom of expression.The CBFC's refusal to issue a certificate to Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring Konkona Sen Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah, Aahana Kumra and Plabita Borthakur, was because ""the story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life.""Actor Tisca Chopra also slammed the CBFC's decision. An outraged Tisca told India Today, ""We have become a laughing stock around the world with this piece of news. I am appalled. This is unacceptable. The reason given for denying the certificate is absolutely absurd.

IAF rescues pregnant woman from flooded Gujarat village,"Acting with lightening speed - peculiar to the Men in Blue and their flying machines, an Indian Air Force Chetak helicopter took flight within minutes of the IAF receiving a request for immediate evacuation of two pregnant women in critical condition, 'about to deliver'.The message with the location details was received at 4:30pm and the Chetak got airborne from Jamnagar at 4:40pm to head for the site.It took barely anytime for the seasoned heads and hands at work at HQ Southern Western Air Command Gandhinagar coordinating Human Assistance and Disaster Relief operations in the area in choosing a Chetak helicopter for this particular operation - owing to its much lesser all up weight as compared to a MI-17V5. Keeping in view - the medical condition of those to be evacuated, the aircraft would need to land to take them on board safely (in all probability on a patch of soft ground as reported by district officials at the site).While the aircraft was enroute to Nana Matra Village of Vinchia Taluka in Rajkot district - the district administration officials informed that one of the two women to be evacuated had already delivered a set of twins and needed to be airlifted immediately. By 5:15pm, the 'Saviour Chetak' was already overhead looking for a safe patch to land.

UK firm faces boycott on not cutting morning-after pill cost,"There have been calls for a boycott of Boots after the chemist refused to lower the cost of the morning-after pill for fear it would encourage over-use. Rivals Tesco and Superdrug halved the price of the emergency contraceptive following a campaign from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), a leading provider of abortion care.The charity had written to retailers asking them to consider offering a more affordable product, after it was revealed that British women are forced to pay up to five times more than their European peers for the contraceptive.Boots, however, said it would not lower the price as it did not want to be accused of ?incentivising inappropriate use?. Campaigners said its statement was insulting and sexist. Around 4% of British women of reproductive age use emergency contraception in any given year. Boots charges £28.25 for Levonelle emergency contraceptive (the leading brand) and £26.75 for its own generic version. Tesco now charges £13.50 for Levonelle and Superdrug £13.49 for a generic version. In France, the tablet costs £5.50.A letter seen by the Guardian to BPAS from Marc Donovan, chief pharmacist of Boots UK, said it had considered the issue very carefully, but pointed out that it is already available for free in community pharmacies and NHS services.However, towards the end of the letter, Donovan wrote: ?In our experience the subject of emergency hormonal contraception polarises public opinion and we receive frequent contact from individuals who voice their disapproval of the fact that the company chooses to provide this service. ?We would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product.?BPAS said deliberately setting the price high to prevent women from using it regularly was both ?patronising and insulting?. Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at BPAS, said: ?There is no doubt about it: the high price of [emergency contraception] is an absolute barrier to women?s access to this product and puts women needlessly at risk of unwanted pregnancy.?Murphy wrote back to Donovan after Tesco and Superdrug reduced the price, asking him to reconsider Boots? position. ?He wrote back and said they weren?t changing their minds and the letter still stood,? she said. Sophie Walker, leader of the Women?s Equality Party, which has joined forces with BPAS to call for a boycott using the hashtag #justsaynon, said that the morning-after pill can be difficult to access for free on the NHS, with appointments at GP surgeries or family planning clinics hard to obtain at short notice.She said: ?Many women will need to buy these pills over the counter, and it is irresponsible and exploitative for retailers to charge over the odds for them ... Boots? approach to this concern is indicative of a society that prioritises profit over women?s health and wellbeing.?When asked for a comment, Boots released a statement that did not discuss the price, nor its reasons for justifying it being kept high, but instead said the sale of the pill was a ?professional healthcare service which, we believe, requires a professional healthcare consultation?.When asked if the reason for the higher price was due to the provision of consultations, Boots did not respond with a comment.",business,3319,60,70

No DU college gets highest grade in UGC's assessment,"There is a rush of students every year for admission to different Delhi University colleges which are considered the best in the country. However, none of the colleges have managed to get the highest grade in quality assessment conducted by a UGC appointed panel. The quality status score is given by the National Accredition and Assessment Council (NAAC), an autonomous body of University Grants Commission (UGC). The highest grade that the body gives is of A++, which no DU college has managed to secure in the latest rankings.Tested on parameters such as curriculum, teaching learning, evaluation, faculty research, infrastructure, learning resources, governance and student services, only three out of the 62 colleges secured the second grade of A+. Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR) and Hindu College have scored 3.65, 3.61 and 3.60 points, respectively. To get A++ an institution has to score a grade between 3.76 to 4. ?There are certain parameters like research, consultancy and extension on which colleges are marked. But if we see research is not factored in our workload and over consultancy there is a veil of secrecy. So for colleges and universities there can?t be judged on the same set of parameters,? said a teacher at LSR on condition of anonymity.However the college whose score has taken everyone by surprise is St.Stephen?s. The college, which has got A grade with 3.21 score, is lower than colleges such as Kirori Mal, Khalsa College, Acharya Narendra Dev College and Jesus and Mary. The A grade also has Sukhdev College of Business Studies, Sri Venkateswara College and Zakir Hussain College. Parameters on which NAAC scores are based Curricular Aspects Teaching-Learning and Evaluation Research, Consultancy and Extension?Infrastructure and Learning Resources?Student Support and Progression?Governance, Leadership and Management?Innovations and Best PracticesThese scores are valid for five years after which the colleges will again have to apply for accreditation. It was in 2012 that UGC made accreditation compulsory for higher educational institutions and DU executive council adopted the decision in 2014. Once an institution applies for the accreditation, a peer team from NAAC visits the colleges for 3-4 days and interacts with teachers, students, alumni and all stakeholders of the institution. ?It is a very systematic process which is comprehensive and some of which is even video recorded,? said a teacher at SRCC.

Punjab female police officer marries her same-sex partner,"India's criminalisation of homosexuality did not stop a Punjab police sub-inspector from marrying a woman and that too with full Punjabi style. Manjit Kaur, a sub-inspector in the Punjab Police, tied a knot with a woman and it wasn't a hush-hush affair. Jalandhar's Pucca Bagh witnessed a big fat same-sex wedding.While the cop wore a red turban, her bride rode a chariot. The marriage was solemnised according to the Hindu rituals, as reported by The Tribune. Reportedly, the wedding took place in the presence of their families, many classmates and colleagues of Manjit too were present at the ceremony.This is not the first time that a same-sex couple has gotten married. In fact, India has its very own gay marriage bureau. Benhur Samson, an NRI, established India's first avenue where gays can find their soulmates in 2016. The bureau helps them find the right match, both within and outside the country. Samson started the arranged gay marriage service when he received numerous requests from gays regarding prospective life partners. Till 2013, he used to help gays with surrogacy. According to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 25 lakh gay people in India. Perhaps, it is time the Supreme Court goes ahead and takes a progressive step and decriminalises homosexuality. Also read:",general,1331,57,70

BMC denies Ganesh mandal's demand for online approval,"With a month to go for the 10-day Ganeshotsav, a Ganesh mandal coordination committee in the city has asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take the process to get permission to setup pandals online. After the Bombay high court issued a directive against structures encroaching public roads, the civic body had drafted rules for pandals in 2015 to ensure pedestrians do not face any inconvenience during the festival. As per this policy, the BMC had made it compulsory for all pandals to get approvals from the police, traffic and fire departments. To improve the application-approval rate, the civic body had introduced single-window clearance in all the 24 wards. The Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshutsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS) pointed out that the single-window clearance system was slow and failed to improve the approval rate, which is why the BMC should start accepting applications online. The committee had met BMC and traffic police department earlier this month to put forth their demands. ?The authorities promised that single-window clearance system will help in quicker approvals or rejections and there will be better coordination between the departments, which was absent last year,? said Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS. The committee will now meet mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar to demand a better single-window clearance system. However, BMC officials said they have no plans to move the system online and all the mandals will have to go to ward offices to submit their applications. The civic official added that though there are more than 11,000 mandals across the city, only 20% of them seek permission to erect pandals during Ganeshotsav.The nine-page circular of the BMC policy was issued to all 24 administrative wards by civic chief Ajoy Mehta, last year, after the HC order.

Daifa-e-Pakistan formed to boost terrorism in J&K: Reports,"While infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) is getting a facelift owing to a torrent of Chinese investment, the terrorism framework in the area too is getting revamped in a bid to foment trouble in India, an India Today TV investigation on ground zero has found.Over 30 religious and jihadi groups have come together to form Daifa-e-Pakistan that has demonstrated and carried out rallies across Pakistan to step up terrorism in Kashmir.According to sources, the aim of the movement is to create a new force of terrorism and channel it against India. One such rally was organised by Daifa-e-Pakistan at Mall road in Lahore. The participants included the leaders of the banned terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hijbul Mujahideen, Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, etc.They demonstrated against India and spelt out a negative propaganda allegedly after informing the government of Pakistan and its army.According to sources, Pakistan is leaving no stone unturned to stoke the unrest in Kashmir caused after the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani last year.Though the US has declared Hafiz Saeed and Hijbul chief Syed Salahuddin global terrorists with rewards for their arrest, these two have been spreading venom against India in different cities of Pakistan.Indian agencies are concerned that the Pakistan-funded terror groups are roping in youngsters for their mission. Much like Hafiz Saeed's son, former ISI chief Hamid Gul's son is also echoing anti-India propaganda by creating associations to mobilise the youth.The number of infiltrators into the India this year has been the highest in the past decade, underscoring Pakistan's agenda. This has led to tension along the Line of Control and ceasefire violations.In the last nine years, after a devastating earthquake in 2006 in PoK, the infrastructure has undergone radical change. Not only roads, but hydropower projects and other ventures are visible on the ground .The pace at which these developmental projects are coming up is worrying for India. China's ""development"" projects"" in PoK and neighbouring Gilgit-Baltistan that involve several thousand Chinese personnel belonging to the construction corps of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) point towards Beijing's expansionist geo-strategic agenda in the region.Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the disputed territory of J&K occupied by Pakistan and is known as the Northern Areas of Pakistan. Some part of the Aksai Chin region was also gifted to China by Pakistan.Many people living in Gilgit and Baltistan are unnerved by the increasing Chinese presence in the area and feel that their resources and land are being sold to China by Pakistan without compensating the actual stakeholders, India Today TV found. Some even believe that all environmental issues are being ignored to favour economic interests of Pakistan.Farman Ali, a well-known journalist from Gilgit, said, ""People who raise their voices against Pakistan are either being jailed or harassed by Pakistani security agencies in Gilgit and Baltistan.""There are some in PoK who believe that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is going to help economic prosperity in the area but that will be clear only when the projects are completed and locals are engaged by Pakistan in economic activities.So far, residents have not been employed in construction work, except some security personnel who have been engaged for protection of Chinese workers.With the reported stationing of a unit of PLA soldiers near the Khunjerab Pass and Chinese military officials frequenting the field command office of Gilgit, which happens to be Pakistan's military headquarters in the region, a pervasive Chinese intent of establishing a military edge in India's northern sector cannot be negated, observers say.ALSO READ |Is China backing Pakistan's position on PoK projects under its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor plan?Pakistan China's new colony?

The interaction was supposed to be for 15 minutes, but was reduced to just 10 minutes for no apparent reason.Many hands went up to get a chance to ask questions, but the opportunity never arrived for most.

5 crore litres of crude oil stolen from Rajasthan oilfield,"Police arrested eight people on Friday for allegedly stealing about 5 crore litres of crude oil from Cairn India?s oilfield in Barmer over the last several years.Cairn India produces about 1.75 lakh barrels of oil per day from its Barmer oilfield, which is India?s largest onshore block. The company said it had filed a case and was cooperating with the police.The eight arrested were mainly transporters and some staff of Cairn contractor companies. The role of some top officials of the oil and gas giant was being investigated, police said, adding that more arrests are likely soon.Modus OperandiAccording to police, the tanker operators were authorised for transporting water, but used to carry oil in two of the five compartments inside the nearly 40,000-litre tanker. The rest would be filled with water.The accused Sata Ram and Dharma Ram were selling the crude to Gautam Singh Rajpurohit and Bhoor Singh Rajpurohit, both residents of Barmer, at a factory located about 12 km from the city.Gautam Singh paid Rs 7.50 per litre to the tanker owner and later sold the crude for Rs 25 per litre, police said. The tanker owner kept Rs 4 for himself and distributed the rest Rs 3.50 among the staff posted at production site, the surveyor, helpers and others.Barmer superintendent of police Gagandeep Singla said the tankers belonged to transport companies Narendra Road lines Ltd (NRL), a Gujarat-based firm, and Shree Mohangarh Construction Company (SMCC), a local entity.At least 44 tankers were used for transportation of which 39 were used for crude theft, police said, adding that they have seized 33 tankers, 11 of NRL and 22 of SMCC, while five have been kept under vigilance.Based on the statement of the accused, police said that theft of 15000-20,000 litres of crude oil worth Rs 3 lakh was taking place daily. With more arrests likely, the figures are likely to go up, police said.Raids on Underground StoragesPolice recovered around 3,500 litres crude from the factory. On checking with Cairn, the company confirmed that it was crude and it matched with the Cairn satellite field crude oil, Singla said.Later, police also traced and raided another factory in Barmer Gadan and found eight underground storage tankers and recovered 43,000 litres of crude.Police said the theft was done in connivance with field-level staff and this nexus had been running since past six years. The security personnel at oil production sites were also questioned.So far, three FIRs have been registered in which hundred people have been named as accused. Of these, 25 had been detained for questioning on Friday, and police arrested eight of them.According to the police, the stolen crude was being supplied to many states and investigation is on to trace the complete ring.Barmer collector Shivprasad Nakate told HT they have formed a committee to probe the matter from some different angles, including the illegalities. Officials from the state petroleum department have also reached Barmer to probe the matter.A Cairn India official said apart from the Rs 10 crore loss to the company, the state exchequer had lost around Rs 50 crore.?As a common practice, Union and state governments get profit from petroleum sale, royalty and other taxes that are higher than that of the operating company. In case of Barmer, the calculation indicates that against a sale of crude of Rs 100, Cairn?s profit is Rs 18 while the union government and the state in total get Rs 82,? he said on condition of anonymity.",general,3496,58,70

Killer of Putin critic Nemtsov sentenced to 20 years in jail,"A Russian court sentenced a man convicted of murdering opposition leader Boris Nemtsov to 20 years in jail on Thursday and handed terms of between 11 and 19 years to four other men convicted of being his accomplices.Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin?s most vocal critics, was murdered in 2015 as he walked across a bridge near the Kremlin after dining with his girlfriend. Aged 55, he had been working on a report examining Russia?s role in the conflict in Ukraine. His killing sent a chill through opposition circles.The same court last month found the five men guilty of killing Nemtsov, but the late politician?s allies said the investigation had been a cover-up and that the people who had ordered his killing remained at large.The court handed the longest sentence, of 20 years, to Zaur Dadayev, a former soldier in Chechnya and the man state prosecutors said pulled the trigger. The other four Chechen men convicted of being his accomplices received jail sentences ranging from 11 to 19 years.?The shortcoming of this sentencing is that those who ordered and organised this crime are not in the dock,? said Vadim Prokhorov, a lawyer for Nemtsov?s daughter Zhanna.State prosecutors said the group had followed Nemtsov around the Russian capital and had been promised a bounty of 15 million roubles ($249,169.44) between them for the high-profile assassination.Shamsudin Tsakayev, Dadayev?s lawyer, told Reuters after the sentencing that there was ?incontrovertible proof? that his client had not committed the crime.",world,1529,60,70

The scheme was introduced by the Maharashtra government to provide a level-playing field for all types of taxis and curb surge-pricing.The drivers urged Danve to convince the state government to make changes to the scheme or scrap it. Issues raised in the drivers? meeting with Danve included the price of cab permits, limiting operations of cabs to within city limits, ban on diesel engines and conversion to CNG. Under the scheme, the state has made it mandatory for drivers using their vehicles for app-based taxi services like Ola and Uber, to register themselves with the transport authorities and follow several rules. The government is also in the process of fixing minimum and maximum fares that such cabs can charge commuters. This will affect business, Ola and Uber drivers said.Yakub Mehta, administration, Action Committee of Maharashtra, said ?We received positive feedback from BJP leaders. There are a series of measures in the scheme which, if implemented, will cause a lot of problems for tourist taxi drivers.?The drivers are scheduled to meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday to discuss the matter.?It will be difficult for us to operate if the City Taxi Scheme is implemented.

Then I would say something. I have said it before, and I rue the day I said it (shared my opinions.) It is about how much views are put across, which is very sad. And then the same people ask, 'Why doesn't Shah Rukh Khan say anything?' No, I won't say anything. You say it, but you can't tell me what to say,"" Shah Rukh was quoted as saying.To put things in context, back in 2015, when Shah Rukh appealed to Indians to preserve and uphold secularism, a massive hate campaign was launched all across India to paint Shah Rukh as an intolerant anti-national and harm the box-office collections of his film Dilwale, which had released just after the controversy.""Religious intolerance and not being secular is the worst kind of crime that you can do as a patriot,"" is what Shah Rukh had said which got him into trouble.Now, Shah Rukh is in no mood to invite trouble when trouble is all the more out there, looking for easy targets like him.

Lok Sabha passes bill to give more autonomy to IIMs,"The Lok Sabha allowed the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) to award degrees to students, passing a bill on Friday that grants greater autonomy to the country?s premier business schools.The bill now goes to the Rajya Sabha for clearance.There are 20 IIMs in the country but none can offer degrees as the institutes are registered as societies under an 1860 law. Unless an institute is established by an act enacted in Parliament or as a university, it cannot grant degrees.The Indian Institute of Management Bill, 2017, alters the top-rated business school?s status, which will enable the institute to award degrees such as MBA and PhD, instead of PGDM and fellowships.Human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar said the aim is to remove government interference in IIMs. ?We should learn to trust our institutions ... joint secretaries running IIMs from Delhi is not desirable.?The bill pushes for IIMs to be declared institutions of national importance. And it has provisions for appointing members in each of the IIM?s board of governors through a transparent process, limiting the HRD minister?s role. The government will have a lone representative in each board. The post of IIM visitor ? currently, the country?s President ? will be abolished.In a rare gesture, opposition parties congratulated Javadekar for bringing the bill. Former junior HRD minister Shashi Tharoor of the Congress praised the steps, but cautioned that handing the IIM boards full control to decide fees could lead to marginalization of poor students. He took the occasion to announce his unhappiness over the government removing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi?s name from the Shillong IIM. He said it was a ?petty? act.Tharoor also objected to the government?s proposal to rename IIM Calcutta as IIM Kolkata. He said the institute will lose its cultivated brand value as IIM-C and the name-change would create confusion as well because an IIM-K exists in Kozhikode. In response, Javadekar said no eligible and meritorious student will be denied admission to IIMs for lack of money. The comptroller and auditor general will check IIM account books since these run on taxpayer?s money, he added.Also, he said: ?There is no provision of giving names to IIMs. All are IIMs. So the question of changing names does not arise,? he said.Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy, who is also an educationist, welcomed the bill and requested the government lower the fee of IIMs to avoid deterring students.CPM parliamentarian MB Rajesh also spoke about the high fee in IIMs. He said the institutes should not use the autonomous status to make money.",general,2632,51,70

Services were affected for at least 15-20 minutes,? he said. Due to delay in services, several passengers also sought refund of their tokens. Thursday was the first time that an operational train in the Delhi metro had caught fire, which was later doused by the fire services. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has ordered a probe into the issue.Delhi Metro?s Blue Line ? that connects Dwarka Sector 21 with Noida/Vaishali ? is the busiest and most snag-prone of all the existing corridors. Of the total daily ridership of 28 lakh, 12 lakh people travel on the Blue Line alone.DMRC later in the day attributed Thursday?s minor fire to a short circuit. ?The air-conditioner had smoke coming out from roof top due to a probable fault in control circuit on the Blue Line at Patel Nagar. As a precaution, deboarding was done at Rajendra Place station. DMRC staff and Delhi Fire Services (DFS) used fire extinguishers and fire-fighting equipment to contain the blaze. Some part of the smoke travelled inside the coach through the heating, venting and air conditioning (HVAC) duct and caused panic amongst passengers,? DMRC said in a statement later.Read More: Is Delhi Metro?s Blue Line crumbling under pressure?The train was taken to the Yamuna Bank depot for further investigation. The fire affected train services for about 15 minutes, after which normal operations resumed.The Delhi Fire Services received the first call of the incident at 4pm responding to which it sent three fire tenders to Patel Nagar station. ?The smoke was gone by the time the tenders reached. The train was moved to Kirti Nagar station as a precaution as there is an extra track available there that wouldn?t affect normal metro operations,? a fire official said.However, the same train caught fire again while being parked at Kirti Nagar station. ?The fire was bigger the second time.

MS Dhoni alleges misuse of name by mobile company,"New Delhi, Jan 29 (PTI) Ace cricketer and former India captain M S Dhoni has alleged before Delhi High Court that a mobile firm was still using his name by projecting him as its brand ambassador despite termination of the agreement between them way back in December 2012. The High Court pulled up the top official of Maxx Mobilink Pvt Ltd after taking note of the plea of former captain that its orders have been defied by the firm. ""Why are you (Maxx) not complying with the order? You have to follow the courts direction...both parties are directed to comply with the order dated April 21, 2016 before the next date of hearing that is July 28,"" Justice Manmohan said. The court was hearing a petition filed by Dhoni seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the companys CMD Ajjay Agarwal for defying its November 17, 2014 direction asking Maxx Mobilink to ""refrain from selling any products"" which uses the name of the cricketer in commercials. The court had also passed a similar order on April 21 last year asking Agarwal to inform about the steps taken to comply with the 2014 direction asking the firm to refrain from selling any product, claiming to be endorsed by Dhoni. The recent direction came after Dhonis counsel Suchinto Chatterji alleged that the firm has not yet complied with its previous directions. Advocate Sanjeev Bhandari, appearing for the firm, said it never indulged in misusing Dhonis name to take any advantage. Dhoni had an endorsement agreement with the company which had expired in December 2012. Earlier, the court had asked Maxx to give details of the steps taken by it to remove Dhonis name and photograph from its social media sites including its website and Facebook.",business,1713,49,70

Pak to get new team of lawyers after ICJ ruling,"After suffering a major setback at the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav death penalty case, Pakistan is set to replace the lawyers that represented the country at the World Court, Pakistani media reports said. Sartaj Aziz, the foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was quoted by The Nation as saying that Islamabad will appoint a new team of lawyers to defend Pakistan's position at the The Hague, Netherlands-based International Court of Justice. The Pakistani legal team was led by Khawar Qureshi who faced off against Harish Salve on Monday when both argued their respective countries' position on the Jadhav death penalty matter.State-run news agency Associated Press of Pakistan further reported Aziz saying that Qureshi had courageously represented Pakistan at the International Court of Justice. The ICJ on Thursday allowed India's petition that Pakistan be directed not to execute Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was handed a death sentence by a Pakistani military court in April this year. The ICJ, accepting India's plea, said Pakistan must not hang Jadhav until the court hears the matter in full and that Islamabad must inform the World Court of the steps it has taken to ensure that the Indian national is not executed.Responding to the ICJ order, Aziz, Pakistan's de facto foreign minister, was reported to have said, ""Pakistan's security is so important and we have to maintain our fundamental sovereign right.""PAK ARGUMENT REJECTEDPresident Judge Ronny Abraham, while delivering ICJ's interim verdict on the Jadhav death penalty case, rejected Pakistan's contention that the World Court has no jurisdiction on the matter. Prima facie, the ICJ has jurisdiction on the Jadhav case, Abraham said, rejecting one of the Islamabad's main arguments against the Indian case. Invoking the Optional Protocol of the Vienna Convention, India had contended that the International Court of Justice has the jurisdiction to take up the Jadhav death penalty case. Notably, the ICJ did not rule on India's main argument that Kulbhushan Jadhav's trial in Pakistan was in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Access.Since Jadhav's arrest in 2016, Pakistan has rejected 16 Indian requests for consular access. Islamabad has claimed that since Jadhav is charged under the country's espionage laws, it does not need to provide New Delhi with consular access. Having ordered Pakistan not to execute Jadhav, the ICJ will now seek comprehensive submissions from both New Delhi and Islamabad on their respective cases. The dates or the schedule of upcoming hearings at The Hague have not yet been announced, but it is likely that the process will take years.THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV CASEIn April this year, the Directorate of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Pakistan military wing, announced that Jadhav, whom Islamabad accuses of being a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and of fomenting unrest in Balochistan, was sentenced to die by a Pakistani army court. Jadhav's death sentence was confirmed by Pakistani army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. India, who said Jadhav is a retired Indian Navy officer-turned businessman, slammed Pakistan for carrying out a secretive, ""farcical"" trial. New Delhi then dragged Islamabad to the International Court of Justice. Pakistan has said that Jadhav has until August to seek mercy. ICJ President judge Ronny Abraham noted that this could mean that Jadhav could be executed soon after August (if a mercy plea is rejected), by when the ICJ may not be able to completely hear the matter and deliver its final verdict.ALSO READ: Nawaz Sharif feels the heat as Opposition slams government for mishandling Kulbhushan Jadhav's case at ICJICJ verdict is fine but can Kulbhushan Jadhav be saved?

"Standoff temporary, won't hit economic, cultural ties: China","Even as Indian and Chinese soldiers continue their weeks-long standoff in Doklam near Sikkim, a Chinese embassy official in New Delhi sought to allay fears of other Indo-Sino ties being hit. The ""long-standing"" economic and cultural ties that India and China share will not be hit. ""Both India and China enjoy long cooperation as our lands are connected,"" news agency IANS quoted Li Rongrong, Second Secretary in the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in India, as saying Monday. ""India and China have enjoyed historical and cultural connections over thousands of years. And, be it trade or other relationships, we have been establishing ties. This border issue, I reckon, is temporary,"" news agency PTI quoted an unnamed Chinese embassy official as saying. ""And it will not affect our long-standing economic and cultural ties.""It wasn't immediately clear if the official quoted by PTI was Li. However, both IANS and PTI reported that the respective comments were made during a promotional event for the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road International Expo to be held in the city of Dongguan in the Chinese province of Guangdong from September 21 to 24.Notably, the India-China Economic and Cultural Council (ICEC), a not-for-profit orgnaisation, renewed its partnership with the Dongguan's municipality for the flagship expo. ""My dear Chinese friends, India is much bigger than what you see on TV screens. Don't believe what the private channels are showing you or the commentators they bring in for their shows. Most of it is rhetoric. Believe only what the Indian government tells or any of its ministers or Foreign Ministry,"" Secretary General of ICEC, Mohd Saqib said in his address at the promotional event.""What unfortunate things you have reading in media or seeing on TV (about the border issue), it is going to be pass very soon. India and China have been Friends and feel welcome in our country. And, I tell the same things to Indian delegates planning to attend this exposition, do not feel insecure,"" Saqib added. THE STANDOFFFor around three weeks now, the Indian and Chinese armies have been engaged in a non-violent standoff in Dokalam, an area that is disputed between China and Bhutan. The standoff was triggered after Indian Army soldiers attempted to stop the People's Liberation Army from constructing a road in the area. The Indian soldiers intervened after Bhutan, whose army first made contact with the Chinese road construction crew, sought New Delhi's help. Since then, soldiers from the Indian Army and the PLA have stood their ground at Doklam in what is the longest-ever, though civilised standoff. Chinese media has unusually raised the rhetoric over the issue, calling on Beijing to teach New Delhi a ""lesson"". The Chinese Army too has been blunt, asking India to immediately withdraw its troops and making passing references to the 1962 Indo-Sino war where India suffered a humiliating defeat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping recently met on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany but there has been no indication - from either countries - on when and how the standoff will be resolved. However, just today Chinese media again upped the ante, with the official China Daily newspaper warning that there will be ""more serious consequences"" if India does not withdraw its troops.",general,3384,60,70

Barca follow UCL comeback win with a 2-1 loss in La Liga,"Barcelona suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Deportivo La Coruña, four days after their dramatic 6-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain. Luis Enrique?s side also lost top-spot to Real Madrid after they beat Real Betis 2-1 last night thanks to a late goal from Sergio Ramos. Zinedine Zidane?s side now lead La Liga by two points and have a game in hand over Barcelona in second. The former Real Madrid youth trainee Joselu gave Deportivo a deserved lead in the 40th minute after an error by the Barça goalkeeper, Marc-André ter Stegen, although Luis Suárez equalised after 46 minutes with a powerful drilled effort.The Depor defender Alex Bergantinos headed them back in front after 74 minutes and Barcelona, who were without Neymar because of a thigh injury and clearly missed the Brazilian?s creative talents, failed to react.Suárez was denied a second equaliser by a brilliant save from Germán Lux as Baecelona suffered a first defeat in 20 league games since being beaten 4-3 at Celta Vigo, also in Galicia, on 2 October.Depor went into the game one place above the relegation zone but are on the rise under new coach Pepe Mel, who has now taken eight points in four games since succeeding the sacked Gaizka Garitano last month.The Galicians were far from intimidated by Barca?s recent run of scoring 17 goals in their previous three outings, and did not allow the champions to settle. Joselu fired a venomous shot at goal in the first real attempt for either side, forcing an outstanding save from Ter Stegen to force a corner.The German let himself down a minute later, though, letting the ball slip out of his hands from a tame shot and Joselu gobbled it up to score from close range.Barca made the ideal start to the second half as Suarez instinctively drilled a loose ball under Lux to pull level, but they could not faze the home side, who soon set about restoring their lead.Alejandro Arribas rattled the post with a header and Deportivo were wrongly given a corner, which they took full advantage of as Bergantinos outmuscled Jordi Alba to head home.?We let them get into the game for too long in the first half and this is what football is like, when you give a team an advantage they always punish you,? Suarez told reporters.?The PSG result did not cost us today, we?ve had enough days to recover. Deportivo are fighting relegation and we knew it was going to be difficult here but we?re not going to give up the fight for La Liga.?",sports,2453,56,70

Convict gets ?2 lakh compensation for 3 yrs jail beyond term,"The Bombay high court has granted compensation of Rs2lakh to a 63-year-old murder convict from Aurangabad because he was kept in jail for three years and nine months beyond his sentence. A division bench of justices TV Nalawade and Sunil Kotwal directed the government to pay the amount to Ranjitsingh Gill within 45 days, failing which it would have to shell out interest at the rate of 12% a year. Gill was arrested in August 1975 on murder charges. He was acquitted by a trial court but the Bombay high court overturned the order and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The high court order was later upheld by the Supreme Court. After serving 17 years and nine months in jail, Gill was released in February 2002. Two years later, he approached the high court, seeking compensation of Rs25 lakh on the grounds that he was illegally detained for three years and nine months beyond the term of his sentence. Though the court agreed that section 433A (giving powers to state to commute or remit sentence)?of the Criminal Procedure Code, which came into effect three years after his conviction, was not applicable in this case, it said that the government had failed to release him on time. ?This court holds that compensation needs to be paid to the petitioner,? ruled the court. ?On the date he submitted his petition, the petitioner was about 50-year-old and it can be said that he lost more than three years of his active life owing to the illegal detention,? said the bench. ?When a person is kept behind bars, his entire family suffers.

'Neem-beer-tree' in Delhi University gives out free liquor,"There is an open bar in the Delhi University, and it?s absolutely free!Poor tipplers in North Campus have been using ?neem beer? from a local tree for the past four months to stay high and hydrated. Several people, mostly labourers working in the university, queue up with containers near the freak neem tree for their daily fix. They like it better than off-the-shelf liquor; moreover, it comes free.?A neem tree has been secreting a white liquid since November 2016. It smells of toddy (naturally alcoholic sap of palm) and tastes somewhat bitter. But people from the campus and outside collect it to drink. They say it is intoxicating,? said Mahesh Prasad, the head gardener of North Campus.There are around 15 neem trees near the rugby stadium towards the back end of the campus, most of which are more than 50 years old. But only one tree is giving out the sap ? at least 10 litres a day.?This is unusual. It is for the first time that we have witnessed anything of this sort in Delhi,? said CR Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) in Delhi University.Like any watering hole, it?s easy to locate the inebriating tree. The strong beer-like scent can be smelled at least 10 feet, or even more, from the tree. The charade of bottles, buckets and pitchers is also a good enough sign.?I had two to three glasses of the toddy. It was quite intoxicating. I didn?t fall ill after that. As it is a neem tree, I think, it also has some medicinal properties,? said a labourer, in high spirits.Someone has also placed a ladder and tied a bucket right at the source. Not a drop to be wasted.?The liquid was coming out from near a joint of two branches. But then, it stopped and started to come out from a different place. The flow is gradually slowing down. The smell is also becoming weaker,? said Vikrant Goswami, a scientific assistant at CEMDE.Scientists from the university?s department of environmental studies are testing ? in the laboratory ? samples of the liquid.?We suspect it is not the kind of toddy which we usually get from palm trees. There is some kind of microbial activity going on inside the tree. The microbe is helping the tree sap to ferment,? said Dr David Kothamasi, assistant professor at the department.It would take at least a month for the test results to be available. In the lab, too, the bottle in which the toddy has been capped started to inflate when its cap was sealed. That?s a signal that the fermentation process has not stopped. Scientists said a similar incident was reported in Varanasi a few years ago. Tests revealed the presence of salicyclic acid, a key ingredient in aspirin.The evergreen neem is the magic tree of Ayurvedic medicine, and is called sarva roga nivarini or the one that prevents and cures all diseases.

World will be at Kohli's feet in a few years' time: Ganguly,"Former India captain Sourav Ganguly on Sunday hailed Virat Kohli's double hundred in the Mumbai Test and said that the future of Indian cricket rests on the shoulders of the Indian Test skipper. (SCORECARD | BALL-BY-BALL UPDATES)""The numbers can't get better than this. If you look at the stats as skipper 30 matches, 3000-plus runs at an average of 100. To have an average like that in 30 matches on a consistent basis is unreal. Hopefully he continues to bat like this.

Future of Indian cricket rests on Virat Kohli and if he continues like this his hunger, his want for runs, he's got a good head on his shoulders. The world will be at his feet in a few years' time,"" Ganguly told India Today in an exclusive chat. (Mumbai Test: India eye victory after Kohli's 235)Ganguly also praised Jayant Yadav, who struck his maiden Test hundred today and scored 104 runs in a 241-run partnership with Kohli for the eighth wicket. (Kohli made batting a lot easier, says Jayant Yadav)""Credit also needs to be given to Jayant Yadav and the way he batted. His technique looks so good. Yes you can say England didn't have the best spinners in the world and they were bowling one lose delivery every over but you still have to put those bad ball away and Jayant has done that consistently. What stands out for me is his technique, his defence against the turning ball and I though he played exceptionally well with the captain. (Virat Kohli gives Wankhede, that Tendulkar experience)""For a young boy in his third Test match to show so much of maturity really speaks terrific of his character,"" he said.Kohli, who was on 147 overnight, eventually fell on 235 to Chris Woakes but not before he put India in a position from where they could dictate terms against England. India posted 631 in their first innings, taking a lead of 231 runs. Spinners Ravindra Jadeja (2/58), Ravichandran Ashwin (2/49) and Jayant Yadav (1/39) then reduced England to 182/6 at the end of the day's play with the visitors still 49 runs behind the hosts.As is the custom these days, whenever Kohli comes out to bat he breaks a plethora of records and today was no exception. Kohli's majestic knock saw him become the first Indian captain in Test history to score three double hundreds in a calendar year.The 28-year-old also went past Mahendra Singh Dhoni to post the highest score by an Indian captain in Test cricket. Dhoni had scored 224 runs against Australia in Chennai in 2013. Kohli now averages more than 50 in all three formats of the game and is the only player in the world at the moment to do so.The Delhi dasher is also the fifth batsman in the world after Michael Clarke (4), Don Bradman (3), Ricky Ponting (3) and Brendon McCullum (3) to score three double hundreds in a calendar year.What impressed the Ganguly the most today was the situation in which Kohli scored his runs.",general,3149,59,70
"Kejriwal fined ?10,000 for not replying in Jaitley case","In a major set back for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi High Court has imposed on him a fine of Rs 10,000 for not filing a response on the fresh Rs 10 crore defamation suit against him by Union minister Arun Jaitley. The joint registrar Pankaj Gupta directed Kejriwal to deposit the cost while granting him two more weeks to file his response. The high court had on May 23 sought the response of Kejriwal on why defamation proceedings should not be initiated against him. OBJECTIONABLE TERMDuring the cross-examination of Jaitley on May 17, Arvind Kejriwal's former counsel Ram Jethmalani had allegedly used a term Jaitley had found objectionable. A day after, another high court judge, who was hearing a connected matter, had termed as scandalous the remarks made by Jethmalani against Jaitley.Terming the word as not only false, baseless, malicious and abusive, but per se defamatory, Jaitley had told the court he was subjected to numerous questions, terminologies/statements that are ex-facie abusive, malicious, offensive, irrelevant and slanderous. At the same time, while hearing Jaitley's another application to expedite the proceedings of the defamation suit, the court directed Kejriwal not to put ""scandalous"" questions to Jaitley. Holding that the remarks by Jethmalani, who has now quit as Kejriwal's counsel, were indecent, the court sought undertakings from Kejriwal's new counsel, who would cross-examine Jaitley. ""I have never seen such scandalous words being used in any suit and it is uncalled for. This is not the way to conduct the cross-examination, they have to control themselves. You have used some words. Do these fall under free speech? Are you aware that these are unparliamentary words?"" the judge said. Justice Manmohan said the chief minister should conduct cross-examination of the senior BJP leader in a dignified manner and in accordance with law. The court added that liberty of free expression could not be confused with the license to make unfounded, unwarranted and irresponsible aspersions. Observing that such words were prohibited under the Evidence Act, the court said if there was even an iota of scandalous questions in future cross-examination, it would transfer the case from the joint registrar to a bench of the high court. DEFAMATION SUITThe AAP leaders had accused the BJP leader of corruption as the president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), a post he had held from 2000 to 2013. Jaitley, who had rejected all allegations levelled by the AAP leaders in December 2015, filed a civil defamation suit seeking Rs 10 crore in damages from Kejriwal and five other others, claiming they made false and defamatory statements in the case involving DDCA, thereby harming his reputation.

Stop inciting people against me: Robert Vadra to Kejriwal,"Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, has slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for consistently targeting him. Vadra, in a Facebook post, asked Kejriwal to speak to him directly instead of making baseless charges.""Robert Vadra seems to be the most referred name in the dictionary of Delhi CM. His remarks ""Vadra will eat him alive"" depict a strange obsession for me. I would humbly request our Delhi CM to come and speak with me directly, for all his grudges he has against me, instead of inciting other people against me. My best wishes to our Delhi CM, in all his endeavours,"" Vadra wrote. The businessman was referring to Kejriwal's statement in the Delhi Assembly a couple of days ago.""You can only arrest Satyendar Jain, not (Sheila) Dikshit.

Drunk man kills dog by standing on it for an hour in Noida,"A person was caught in camera allegedly strangling a street dog to death with his feet in Noida?s Sector 45 on Friday night.The man, who was allegedly drunk, stood with his feet pressing the dog?s neck and mouth onto the road for about an hour and only moved after the dog breathed its last.The 18-sec video clip shot by a passerby shows the man standing on the dog, pressing the dog?s mouth and neck onto the ground with one foot and holding its hind legs with another foot.One of the eyewitnesses, who shot the video in his cell phone camera, told Hindustan Times, that man was heavily drunk and pressed the dog to the ground with his feet for about an hour, before it died. The incident took place at Som Bazaar in Noida Sector 45 between 9pm and 10 pm on Friday night. The eyewitness, said, ?The man in question is an ex-army person and voluntarily worked as a traffic marshal along with Gautam Budh Nagar police in Noida.?He said people who passed made several ?appeals? to the man, but he did not get off the dog.?He stood on the dog with his feet making the animal immovable. When people asked to leave the dog he quarrelled with them and did not move. He was adamant to kill the animal, as it barked at him,? he said.Meanwhile, the People for Animals representative in Noida on Saturday have taken cognizance on the matter and approached the police to register a complaint in the matter under prevention of cruelty against animals.Ashima Sunil, the president of the group in Ghaziabad, said, ?It is really a brutal act.

SC denies abortion to 32-week pregnant 10-yr-old rape victim,"The Supreme Court noted on Friday a sharp rise in pleas from women seeking to abort pregnancies beyond the legally permissible time limit while rejecting a 10-year-old rape survivor?s request to terminate her 32-week pregnancy. Medical opinion placed before the court said the abortion would not be in the interest of either the girl or the foetus.A bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar asked the central government to consider setting up a permanent medical board in every state to quickly decide on pleas from pregnant women asking for terminations beyond the permissible 20-week period. The bench said these boards were needed to save time because such cases were coming to the courts in a ?big way?.This year, the Supreme Court has received at least seven petitions from women, including teenage rape survivors, asking to terminate pregnancies beyond 20 weeks. The top court disallowed abortions in two, including Friday?s, lawyers said.Courts allow terminations beyond that in the rarest of circumstances if doctors say it is necessary to save the mother?s life.Friday?s order came after the court perused the report of an expert panel set up by the PGI, Chandigarh, to find out ?whether the health of the girl concerned and the child would be adversely affected if the pregnancy is allowed to be full term?.The bench expressed satisfaction over the medical care being provided to the rape survivor and dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a lawyer seeking the abortion.To the court?s suggestion on setting up permanent medical boards in states, solicitor general Ranjit Kumar said he would inform the court whether such boards can operate while amendments to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA), 1971, considered extending the time-limit from 20 to 24 weeks.The girl, who hails from Chandigarh, was repeatedly raped by her uncle. Her parents were poor and had approached the Chandigarh district court for permission to terminate the pregnancy. On July 18, the court dismissed the plea, citing the 20-week ceiling. A lawyer then went to the top court.The girl was allegedly raped over seven months. Her parents got to know of it when they took her to a doctor after she complained of a stomach pain, her parents said.In another case a bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra allowed a 21-year-old woman from Mumbai to abort her 22-week-old foetus following a medical opinion that post-birth the child will have severe mental impairment.A three-member panel of experts from JJ Hospital concluded the foetus suffered from Hydrocephalus, or accumulation of fluid in the brain. The court asked the woman to approach JJ Hospital for the termination, which it said should be done soon.",general,2715,60,70
I-T dept attaches assets worth ?33cr linked to AAP minister,"The Income Tax department dealt a body blow to the reputation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by attaching assets allegedly amassed illegally by Satyendar Jain, a senior minister in the Delhi government.The assets attached under the Benami Act include more than 100 bighas of land with investment value of Rs 17 crore and shares amounting to Rs 16 crore.Jain, who holds the portfolios of industry, power, health and public works department in Delhi?s AAP government, denied the allegations.??my name has been wrongly dragged to create a false impression against me,? Jain said in a statement.But if the allegations are substantiated, it will be a major setback to AAP and the government headed by Arvind Kejriwal. The central claim, which powered the party so dramatically to power in Delhi two years ago, was built on anti-corruption. Coming just ahead of the municipal elections in Delhi, the revelations could potentially impact AAP?s prospects in the electoral contest.The AAP also denied all charges.?There has been no order that has been received by Satyendar Jain on this issue. He was an architect by profession before he joined politics. He was a member of the board of the companies but he quit six months before he was given a ticket by the AAP in 2013,? said a senior party leader, who did not wish to be named.The provisional attachment orders, dated February 27, were issued under the Benami Prohibition transactions act 1988 by the initiating officer of the National capital territory of Delhi to Indo Metalimpex Pvt Ltd, Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd, Paryas Infosolutions and Mangalaytan Projects Pvt Ltd under the act.The order said that cash consideration for making illegal entries in Indo Metalimpex Pvt Ltd and Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd was provided by Jain. The money received from the accommodation entries in the form of share capital/premium was used to purchase the properties, the order added. Jain said in his statement that he had not been associated since July 31, 2013 with any of the companies. ?I have earned all my income with my hard work and I have been a tax payer for decades. I am not afraid of any probe about my income details, nor am I scared of any political vendetta, but I reserve the right for appropriate legal action in case my name is unnecessarily dragged into a controversy.?The AAP has, in the past, claimed a witch-hunt by a ?hostile? union government led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), a political rival. Since 2015, more than ten MLAs of the Delhi assembly have been arrested in various cases.This is not the first time Jain has come under the scanner.

As per CIA reports and minutes of high-level meetings in Washington on Indo-Pak tensions, it was clear that the US government was readying a strategy should India smash military power of West Pakistan. US President Richard Nixons National Security Adviser Henry A Kissinger discussed various possibilities due to deteriorating Indo-Pak ties in the wake of Indias military offensive in East Pakistan. However, some top security officials in Washington felt the possibility of India launching a strike on West Pakistan was remote. At one of the meetings of Washingtons Special Action Group, the then CIA Director Richard Holmes said, ""It is reported that prior to terminating the present hostilities, Mrs Gandhi intends to attempt to eliminate Pakistans armour and air force capabilities,"" as per papers which are part of nearly 12 million documents CIA declassified last week.

Pritam (composer) probably delivered the music only a week before. What can you say? You don?t take an opinion from anybody. Today?s filmmakers are doing this with everybody. They don?t show their films before release to take opinions, and treat it as though they?re making a nuclear bomb. I didn?t hate or love the film. I only felt it needed to be abridged by 20 minutes. But who is going to give that opinion to them? I totally agree with Ekta (Kapoor) when she threw him out from her film. He had problems with Rakesh Roshan while working on Kites (2010). He?s such an irresponsible director that he doesn?t complete the film. It was supposed to release three times in the past two years, but it kept getting delayed. Asked about why the film wasn?t released in some international markets on time, Rishi Kapoor again blamed Basu?s delays. ?It did not release in Singapore because you have to deliver it five days in advance. It did not release in the Gulf on Thursday because it was only delivered to them on Thursday. This is unreasonable and irresponsible. You may be thinking you are making the Taj Mahal, but you are supposed to make it ready on time. Even Pritam delays his submissions. [It was later promoted as] a kids? film. But, a kids? film also has to release at the right time, like during the school vacations. At that time too, Anurag Basu wasn?t ready. There?s economics and maths involved. Everything is not just about creativity.??You may be the biggest director in the world,? he said, ?but nobody would like to work with you because you are irresponsible. There is somebody else?s money involved in this. I trusted you, and this is what you give us? Ranbir hasn?t held back on spending money on it. You even threw Govinda out of the film. If you don?t want Govinda to work in your film, why did you ask him in the first place??Jagga Jasoos released on 14 July. It has so far made Rs 45 crore. According to a Forbes report, the film recorded one of the worst Friday-to-Friday drops of all time, plummeting 85% on its second Friday.

Talking about toilets is still taboo in India: Akshay Kumar,"Akshay Kumar, whose forthcoming movie Toilet Ek Prem Katha stresses on the importance of building toilets and ending open defecation, hopes the film changes people's mindset about this ""taboo topic in Indian society"".Akshay said in an interaction with the media, ""Talks on toilet are still taboo in India. I remember when I had to say a dialogue in the film which is, 'Ab biwi ghar aaye na aye, sundaas to laakar hi chhodunga is gaon mein', people were rethinking if I should say it or not. But as an individual, I think it is necessary... I mean who does not go to the toilet?""However, he is hopeful that things will change.""Our youth is very strong minded. They understand the necessity of using the toilet. Some people are starting to talk about it, which is great... It means awareness has been created. See, it is also about the mindset. In places where I have gone, I heard people saying, 'We don't do it (defecate) in the same house where we cook food'. But how can they openly defecate on the field, from where the food is coming? Government is doing its part (by sanctioning public toilets)... People should also take a step,"" said the Airlift actor.Directed by Shree Narayan Singh, Toilet Ek Prem Katha also features Bhumi Pednekar, and is releasing on August 11 this year.Considering the fact that the Hindi film industry is going through a rough patch and that footfalls in theatres are decreasing, Akshay was asked if ticket price is one of the reasons behind that. He said, ""But then regional films and Hollywood films are doing well. If the ticket price is not affecting their business, then why ours? Maybe content is responsible then.""Whether it is Airlift, Rustom, Jolly LLB 2 and even Toilet Ek Prem Katha, Akshay is acting in stories that project realism.Asked if that is a strategy, the National Award-winning actor said, ""If you are talking about issue-based stories like Toilet Ek prem Katha, I think being a successful actor by the grace of God, if my association gives the film a better mileage and if the story intrigued me, I do it. I got to know from research statistics that one child dies every five minutes in our country because of open defecation. Do you understand the intensity of the issue? That apart, if there's any story that is interesting, I do it.""Toilet Ek Prem Katha is Akshay Kumar's second release in 2017, after Jolly LLB 2 that hit the screens this Holi.

"If I can gain from launching SRK's son, why won't I: Karan","Karan Johar is fed up with the allegations of nepotism. It all began on his talk show Koffee With Karan where Kangana Ranaut called him the ""flag-bearer of nepotism"". This opened the floodgates to endless debates about the ethics behind casting star-kids in films at the cost of denying chances to deserving industry outsiders.Now, Karan Johar has opened his heart on the matter in his latest blog post. Starting off by saying that he cannot handle the 'nepospasms' (A condition that, KJo describes, arises from the fear of the word 'nepotism'), Karan Johar goes on to defend his casting choices and adds that if he can be accused of nepotism, everyone can be.""While we're on the subject, may I point out that while we can (and have) put the star on screen, we cannot make the audience arrive. So if it is a nepotistic world, we're not the only ones guilty of it. Taken a look at any entertainment website recently? They're full of star kids. It's all about Sara (Ali Khan) and Jhanvi (Kapoor) and Aryan (Khan) and Aarav (Kumar). They step out and they're photographed, they're the ultimate clickbait,"" Karan Johar wrote on Ndtv.com.Karan Johar added that his nepotism was a ""a result of easy access to an exceptional resource.""""Yes, I have launched Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan, and, yes, maybe you can say nepotism played a part. You can argue that there was proximity and I leveraged it, that there were relationships at play which were factored. David Dhawan was, and is, a friend. I took his son on as an AD (assistant director) as a favour to that friend. And then I saw talent. And then I platformed it. When it came to Alia, I wasn't even talking to Mahesh Bhatt! I've even gone on record saying we had issues. We had auditioned 5,000 people and she was one of them. If there was anyone better than Alia Bhatt, she would have been in the movie, but there wasn't. She just stood out. Maybe her name played a role in why, but I think her body of work already proves that's not it,"" Karan Johar wrote.Karan Johar went on to defend his right to cast whoever he wants provided his casting decision brings audience in the theatres.""We're not NGOs! We are businesses with bottom lines and budgets. And tomorrow if I want to launch Shah Rukh Khan's son because he's Shah Rukh Khan's son and I believe I can gain from it, why won't I? I run a company, it's a balance of commerce and art, and both matter,"" Karan wrote.Karan Johar ended his blog post by saying that if he is to be blamed of nepotism, then that is fine, but he is not the only one who can be accused of it.""I'm not alone.

Juvenile convicted in Dec 16 gangrape now cooks at a dhaba,"Away from the limelight on the verdict in the December 16 gang-rape and murder, the ?juvenile? convicted in the case, who was found guilty of raping and killing the 23-year-old physiotherapist on December 16, 2012 ? has settled well in his new life. He is cooking at a prominent restaurant. The minor has turned 23 years old now.?He was always worried about getting lynched and that is why he was sent to the southern part of the country. Now, the verdict has come, focus will again move to him but he is at a place where he might not even see the national news channels. His employer is not aware of his past and even he has left it behind,? said a NGO official, who was part of his rehabilitation process. The officer, however, refused to reveal any further details fearing safety of the ?juvenile?. A year after he walked free, he was employed at a dhaba in south India. ?After his release on December 20, 2015, he was kept with an NGO for a few days. Later, the NGO rehabilitated him to the southern part of the country. He is currently employed as cook at a restaurant,? he said. The officer said that not many are aware of his background. He was 11 when he fled home, 240 km from Delhi. His elder sister single-handedly fends for the family of six ? ailing mother, younger siblings and bedridden father. The family still lives in the same village.After leaving home, he came to Delhi to earn money and got in touch with Ram Singh and the other accused. He used to clean the bus in which the physiotherapist student was raped on December 16, and they would give him food in return. On that night too, they asked him to accompany them.During his time at the shelter, he used to call his mother often, said an official.A number of welfare officers and a counsellor, who spoke to him at the correction home, told HT that he was the most disciplined inmate.They say soon after coming to the shelter, he turned religious. He grew a beard and started offering namaz five times a day. Initially, he was kept away from the other inmates. But during the last year of his stay, he shared the dormitory with a high court blast accused.?This led many to believe that he was radicalised. So he was shifted to a separate room. He had little interest in studies and the only thing he learnt was to write his name. Cooking is his passion and he was always there to give a final touch to dishes prepared by the staff. Inmates often demanded food cooked by him,? the officer added.However, intelligence bureau still keeps a watch on him.?He was a victim of circumstances. When I got a chance to meet him, I found him sad the way his role was portrayed in the incident. He was pushed into child labour at the age of 9 and worked at hazardous sectors.

"1,500 AIIMS doctors to learn taekwondo for safety at work","Rising violence against doctors has prompted nearly 1,500 resident doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to learn taekwondo so that they are able to defend themselves on duty. In March, after three incidents of violence were reported in three days, more than 3,000 resident doctors, working in the emergency, out-patient departments and wards, went on strike for five days in Maharashtra. ?We had supported our counterparts in Mumbai by wearing helmets to work in March. This is because we are genuinely concerned about our safety. Keeping the same in mind, we had requested the AIIMS administration to organise self-defence classes for us. They granted us permission to conduct taekwondo classes in AIIMS gymkhana club,? said Dr Vijay Gurjar, president of the resident doctors? association.The doctors, in batches of 100, will train at the gymkhana club between 7-8 pm every day from May 15. The basic course will be for 6 months and the black belt course for 30 months.According to a report in the Lancet journal, while 75% doctors in tertiary care hospitals face physical or verbal violence at work at least once in lifetime, over 40% of them faced it in 2016.The problem is multifactoral. Overcrowding in public health facilities forcing doctors to spend less time with patients, corruption and over-charging for services (in which the referring doctor gets a cut) leading to the breakdown in the doctor-patient trust are some of the reasons recognised by the study.?Doctors are forced to spend less time listening to the patients or their caregivers. The concept of shared decision making is almost absent. The average conversation between a doctor and a patient might last just a few seconds,? said Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, neurology professor, Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Varanasi. VIOLENCE REGISTRYThe IMA will launch a registry where doctors can report any incidence of violence along with evidence such as videos, photos, CCTV footage, and newspaper clippings. The doctors? body will then conduct an investigation and do a root cause analysis.?This will help us in understanding why violence is happening, predict when the violence might happen and look at measures to prevent such incidences,? said Dr Dr KK Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).WHAT PATIENTS WANT?Confrontations happen because of the anger caused by non-fulfilment of desire. Hence, we need to understand what the patients really want,? said Dr Aggarwal.A survey done by the IMA found that 90% of the patients wanted doctors acknowledge and address them, 92% wanted doctors to listen, 89% wanted the doctors to explain what the illness is and keep them informed throughout. Around 75% of the people also wanted their doctors to review ? ask them if they understood and, if not, help them understand. 40% of the respondents also wanted the doctors to thank them. ?The patients said that they always thank the doctors, but they wanted that the doctor thank them in return as they gave them an opportunity to treat their relative. We called the study ALERT ? Acknowledge, Listen, Explain, Review and Thank,? said Dr Aggarwal.",health,3138,57,70
"Effigies of Rajinikanth burnt, protestors term him Kannadiga","Superstar Rajinikanth may have resorted back to his acting career and is leading a normal life after dropping hints to join politics, but all is not peaceful in Tamil Nadu. His May 19 speech was replete with hints of political ambition while the superstar met with his fans after a long time. But things have taken a drastic turn in Tamil Nadu politics since then. A day after Rajinikanth's speech, his effigy was burnt in Coimbatore by TPDK movement members claiming that he insulted Tamilians. But the next disaster was waiting to happen in Chennai.On May 22, another pro-Tamil group Thamizar Munnetra Padai decided to protest against Rajinikanth claiming him to be a Kannadiga. Veeralakshmi, the leader of the group announced a protest and that she would lay siege on Rajinikanth's house at Poes Garden. Security was beefed up and no vehicles were allowed beyond the checkpoints which were resurrected after Jayalalithaa's death.But to their surprise, Veeralakshmi brought her group near American Counsel and burnt the effigy of Rajinikanth. Embarrassed cops were unable to go near the effigy as it was packed with crackers, which is a new trend to make the police stop the protest. ""Down down, Kannadiga actor Rajnikanth. Tamil Nadu is only for Tamils,"" yelled Veeralakshmi while she held a flag near the burning effigy.The cops finally put out the fire, removed the effigy and arrested 17 members of the group. To everyone's surprise, not much outrage was seen in Chennai from Rajinikanth's fans.Yet around 4 pm in the evening, outraged Rajinikanth fans protested against Veeralakshmi and burnt her effigy at Madurai. Close to 50 Rajinikanth fans assembled near Periyar Bus stand and burnt Veeralakshmi's effigy raising slogans against anyone who opposed Rajinikanth's entry into politics.

Egypt's Islamic authority sets up fatwa kiosk at metro,"Sheikhs from Egypt?s highest Islamic authority have opened a fatwa kiosk in the Cairo metro to offer religious advice to commuters in what they say is an effort to counter extremism.The idea is proving popular with travellers passing through Cairo?s al-Shohada metro station, a busy transport hub, who queue up to sit with a group of religious scholars inside a green patterned booth, sheltered from the bustle of the metro.?We usually talk about the issues of daily life, and what religion says about such things. The topics we mostly discuss are marriage, divorce and inheritance,? said one sheikh staffing the booth for the morning commute, who declined to be named.According to al-Azhar al-Sharif, Egypt?s top Islamic body, which installed the booth, the project is intended to correct misinterpretations of Islam. The institution has frequently clashed with the government of the president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, who has repeatedly called for a ?religious reformation? in Islam to combat extremism.Egypt has grappled with a spike in jihadist activity since Sisi came to power in 2013, including a recent string of large-scale attacks on Coptic Christian sites as well as ongoing violence in the Sinai peninsula.Al-Azhar, established in Cairo in 971 as a centre of Sunni Muslim learning, is hoping that the booth will help steer Egyptians away from extremist thought.Sheikh Tamer Mattar, the coordinator of its International Centre for Electronic Fatwas, said that the booth was designed to direct citizens to seek advice from al-Azhar, instead of extremist groups. ?The experiment was successful so far and we hope that it will expand,? he said. ?We can say it was successful, as in the eight days of the initiative, we received 1,500 questions. At any moment you can find tens of people waiting to present theirs.?The booth operates two shifts daily, welcoming visitors from 9am until 8pm. Yet few seemed convinced that the project would attract those with pre-existing extremist tendencies to seek guidance, especially as those staffing the booth noted down the identity card number of those visiting along with their complaints. Extremists won?t come to us to seek advice,? said the sheikh staffing the booth for its morning shift. ?We?re targeting people on the street who are ignorant of religious matters ? they come to us and we try to put them on the right track of moderation.? Mohamed Abu-Hamed, an Egyptian MP who has sparred frequently with al-Azhar over a desire for greater government regulation of the religious body and its teachings, dismissed the booths. ?The whole project is absurd. It is a superficial understanding of the call to renew the religious rhetoric,? he said.?When we talk about renewing religious rhetoric, we mean the main content [of their teachings],? he said. ?If al-Azhar created these kiosks while thinking that this is renewing religious rhetoric, then they don?t get it. They are doing this to evade making any real changes.?",world,2971,54,70

"Jism earned more than Zakhm, Tamanna, Dushman, Sur: Pooja","During her recent interview with HTBrunch, Pooja Bhatt revealed that after making sensitive movies like Zakhm and Tamanna, she ventured into adult content with Jism because those kind of movies have a mass appeal.?My first production was Tamanna. The age that Alia is today, I had made a film on female infanticide. It won a National Award. But the audience hardly came to watch the film in the theatres. Then I made Zakhm, again a sensitive movie based on my father?s real life story, was a box office disaster. Not a single person went to watch it in the theatres. It is not that it didn?t have star value. It had names like Ajay Devgn, Nagarjuna, Pooja Bhatt and Mahesh Bhatt. But that failed to get the audience to buy the tickets. Then I made Jism. The business of Jism is more than the collective business off Zakhm, Tamanna, Dushman, Sur all put together.?India pretends concerns, but watches something else. It is people who made Jism run to packed houses. Just as if a magazine is not getting readers, you need to tweak it to suite their taste, eventually, with movies it?s about business and people will only put money in something that will yield profit,? she says.And she has taken her lessons from one of the best in the business, her father, Mahesh Bhatt. ?My father always says that there are two kinds of cinema. One that you make to jolt the audience and the other is the kind you make to soothe the jolted. Eighty per cent of India lives below the poverty line and they want escapism. And there is the elite intellectual audience who goes to the cinemas in the fine saris and gold and they want to see the other side - the darker side that has poverty and diseases. So it depends on who you choose to cater to.?Pooja is of the opinion that neither of the two is inferior as each fulfils the need of one set of audience. ?To me, a Dabangg is as relevant as a Masaan. I loved both films, each appealed to a different sensibility in me. I am a commercial filmmaker and I make no bones about that. At the end of the day I want people to watch my films. I am not interested in making movies that only 10 people will watch and will get critical appreciation at some festival.?Also, Jism is a film she stands by. ?It was the first true adult film of our times. For a change, it was about a strong woman talking about her sexual needs . Unlike the sex comedies today, it had no double entendre, no bad jokes, nothing. It was a movie made by adults, for adults. When sex is regarded as a bad word, the society starts to rot from inside. ?The definition of a b***h nowadays is that you know your mind and are unafraid to state it,? says Pooja. ?By that logic, I am certainly a b***h. For I certainly know what I want. More than that, I know what I don?t want. And so did my heroine in Jism.?

Serena Williams suggests she is pregnant on Snapchat,"Serena Williams is pregnant with her first child, her spokesperson has confirmed.The tennis star hinted at the good news when she posted a photo of herself on Snapchat wearing a swimsuit and revealing what appeared to be a large baby bump with the caption ?20 weeks? on Wednesday. The snap was deleted less than a half hour later.However, Williams? team confirmed the implications of the photo later in the day. ?I?m happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall,? a spokesperson for Williams told the Guardian by email.The Women?s Tennis Association, which listed Williams as scheduled to enter next month?s Madrid Open as recently as Monday, said they had yet to be contacted by anyone from the American?s team regarding her status.?We have not been informed, nor do we have confirmation,? a tour spokesperson told the Guardian. ?We will let you know once we have further information.?Serena's snap suggests that she won the Australian Open without dropping a set while pregnant. pic.twitter.com/ltPndJRJBqWilliams, 35, announced she was engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in December. The announcement left the sport?s chattering class wondering to what degree she was looking ahead to life after tennis.She answered that speculation with brio at the Australian Open, capturing her 23rd major singles title without dropping a set, to eclipse Steffi Graf?s record for grand slam titles in the Open era and regain the No1 ranking she had ceded in the fall to Germany?s Angelique Kerber.But she has been inactive since her win over elder sister Venus in the final at Melbourne Park. Last month, Williams pulled out of Indian Wells and Miami, citing a left knee injury. That enabled Kerber to retake the top ranking, though Serena is assured a return to No1 in next week?s table when the points from last year?s Porsche Grand Prix drop off.The announcement comes one week after Victoria Azarenka, the former world No1 and two-time grand slam champion, announced she will return to the tour after 14-month layoff that included the birth of her son, Leo, in December.Williams? win at Melbourne Park made her the oldest player to win a major singles championship in the Open era, breaking a record she set herself last year ? and again the year before that. She has won grand slam titles in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (10, more than triple the previous mark). No one could think less of Williams, now closer to 40 than 30, if she called it a career.But there?s equal if not more reason to believe Williams has unfinished business.She remains tantalizingly close to the all-time grand slam record held by Australia?s Margaret Court, whose 24 major titles were split between the amateur and professional eras. She still plays at an extraordinary high level, having won 125 of her 138 singles matches since Wimbledon 2014. And while there are no shortage of young lions on the tour, among them Garbiñe Muguruza, Karolína Plí?ková and Madison Keys, none has offered a sustained challenge of Williams? dominance the way Monica Seles swiftly ended Graf?s stranglehold on the sport.Nor would Williams be the first mother to excel on the tour.Kim Clijsters was already a borderline Hall of Famer when she retired abruptly at 23, having won the 2005 US Open and spent 19 weeks atop the women?s rankings. But the Belgian was even better after a 28-month layoff that included the birth of her daughter, winning once more at Flushing Meadows as an unseeded wild card in only her third tournament back. That made her the first mother to win a major singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980, setting the stage for a final act that included two more grand slam titles and a return to the No1 ranking.",general,3729,52,70

The teams now plan on how they are going to face Ashwin. I would like to congratulate him for reaching 250 wickets.

There might be some occasions, he can't get wickets. But that's the best part about this Indian team. We bowl as a unit, we bowl in partnerships, most of the times.

""The health department is committed to secure the child from infection in the womb of a HIV-positive mother,"" Chhattisgarhs health services director R Prasanna told PTI.

Who are they to comment on Kareena's life: Randhir on trolls,"?Who the hell are they to interfere in our lives?? says an angry Randhir Kapoor, referring to the social network trolls pointing fingers at his daughter, Kareena Kapoor Khan, for occasionally taking out me-time while she has a seven-month-old son. ?Kareena is a modern girl, and she has to go and work out to stay in shape, or else she?ll get trolled for that, too. She has worked all her life and continues to do that after having a baby, so definitely she?s not leaving the child behind; rather, she?s striking the perfect balance.?The veteran actor?s anger boiled over while speaking to us on the phenomenon that may be described as ?let?s troll Kareena because she dares to find time for herself?.Kareena?s pregnancy and later becoming a mother to baby Taimur in December last year has, perhaps, been one of the most celebrated recent occasions in Bollywood.

"PM seeks UK's help in return of Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi","(Eds: Updating with more quotes) By Barun Jha Hamburg, Jul 8 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi today pressed upon his British counterpart Theresa May to ensure UKs cooperation to bring back economic offenders, amidst India working hard for the return of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya and former IPL chief Lalit Modi. Mallya has been in the UK for months, escaping arrest warrants against him, while a court in London is also hearing a case regarding his return to India. Modi today met May during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit here and sought UKs help in this regard. Both leaders also talked about the complete range of India-UK ties. In a tweet after the meeting, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Baglay said the Prime Minister asked for UKs ""cooperation for return of escaped Indian economic offenders"". On economic offenders issue, Baglay said, ""you have seen our tweet"". On whether cooperation from the UK was sought with just Mallya in mind, he said, ""The tweet mentions economic offenders who have escaped from India and that is the answer"". To a query on whether was Mallya in focus in terms of escaped economic offenders discussed with May, Baglay said, ""We have put out a tweet and the term used there is a plural... its English language and people who know English should understand it"". Asked whether all on the list were discussed and no specific names were mentioned, he said, ""I wont like to go into that and what we have said in the tweet is what our position is"". Baglay refused to comment directly on any question related to Mallya. Mallya, who is wanted in India for Kingfisher Airlines default on loans worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore, has been in the UK since March 2016. In April, he had attended a central London police station for his arrest and was released on conditional bail a few hours later after providing a bail bond worth 650,000 pounds, assuring the court of abiding by all conditions associated with extradition proceedings, such as surrender of his passport and a ban on him possessing any travel documents. Lalit Modi, former chief of Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted by the Indian authorities with respect to a money laundering probe and he is said to be in the UK. The former cricket administrator has maintained that he has not done any wrong in any of the IPL deals.",general,2353,56,70
Censors have issue with female viewpoint: Lipstick director,"A Bollywood director whose ?lady oriented? film was blocked by censors has hit back at the movie establishment, saying it needs more women at the top to battle deep-rooted Indian prejudice. ?The censors have a problem with a female point of view; they?re just not comfortable with something that questions or disturbs the status quo,? said Alankrita Shrivastava, whose film has now overcome its critics and will be released in Indian cinemas on Friday.Shrivastava said popular culture was shaped by man?s perspective, and it was therefore important to encourage more women directors, artists and storytellers. Her movie - which profiles women who break free from tradition - stars a Muslim woman and a middle-aged widow among its unlikely heroines.Shrivastava battled hard on social media for its release after India?s censor board refused to certify Lipstick Under My Burkha, calling the film ?lady oriented?.Shrivastava appealed the decision with the film certification tribunal, which said the film could be released with an adult certification and after minor cuts. Relating the story of four women who want to realise their dreams, the movie has sparked a debate in India over what is permissible in movies and how women are actually portrayed. ?Our popular culture, our cinema is largely a product of the male gaze, for the male gaze,? she said.?Art and popular culture are powerful tools we can use to have a conversation about perspective and conditioning. It can force us to think differently, see a different point of view.?Women film directors in India?s Bollywood, just as in Hollywood, make up only a small fraction of the industry. Churning out about 1,000 films a year, Bollywood is largely known for its formulaic fare of action flicks and syrupy romances with elaborate song-and-dance sequences.Movies with female protagonists and stories that challenge gender stereotypes are still rare. This has a far-reaching effect on audiences, said Shrivastava. ?Women are 50 percent of the population; we have a particular way of seeing things, but it is the male perspective that has dominated for so long in popular culture,? she said.?This perspective has led to discrimination against women, violence against women. Our popular culture justifies this perspective, and makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment and abuse of women okay.?Campaigners in India have urged the film industry to stop glorifying stalking and harassment after several violent deaths of women. There has also been a campaign to rewrite Bollywood songs to end gender stereotyping and misogyny in films.",entertainment,2592,59,70

The coup plotters declared their seizure of power on the state broadcaster, bombed the country?s parliament and other key locations, and raided a resort on the Aegean where Erdo?an had been holidaying. But the Turkish president had already left and the coup attempt was eventually put down by civilians and security forces.Nato?s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, used the first anniversary of Turkey?s failed coup to warn that any attempt to undermine democracy in one of the bloc?s was ?unacceptable?.Stoltenberg paid homage to about 250 people who lost their lives resisting the failed attempt, praising the Turkish people who took to the streets and ?stood up against this heinous act in defence of its elected government and democratic institutions?.He said added: ?(I) still remember the shock I felt seeing the damage inflicted at the parliament building by the bombardments of the coup plotters.?The Bosphorus Bridge, now called the 15 July Martyrs?

"Delhi crime rate down by 31%, cops solved 65% cases in 2017","Crime is down in Delhi and the police's solve rate is up, data in possession of Mail Today shows.With effective ground policing and the formation of core teams at the district level, city cops have managed to slash the crime rate by 31.54 per cent and crack many more heinous crimes compared to last year. The solve rate has gone up by 16.77 per cent.Senior officials believe that this could happen only because of the change in policing methods brought about by commissioner Amulya Kumar Patnaik.The official data also reveals that incidents of dacoity have gone down by 21.05 per cent, and this year Delhi Police managed to solve 93.33 per cent of the cases. Instances of robbery have gone down too. In 2016, up to May 15, as many as 2,177 such cases were reported, compared to 1,180 in the same period this year. Cops managed to solve 45.15 per cent of the cases in 2015, while the figure this year is 65.42 per cent.'IN THE FUTURE, CRIME RATE WILL GO DOWN'The Capital has often been tagged with the dubious distinction of being India's most unsafe metropolitan city. Giving credit to foot patrolling and effective investigation by special teams formed in all districts, senior Delhi Police officials said, ""In the near future the crime rate will go down and whenever a case will be reported it will be solved."" This year, 740 cases of rape were reported till May 15, compared to 802 in 2016. And cops have cracked 77.30 per cent of the cases reported this year. Senior officials added that one of the reasons behind the improving solve rate is promotions of cops and power of investigation granted to them.Patnaik, who took charge as Delhi's police commissioner on January 31 this year, is the man behind the promotions as he believes that promoting cops will not only help in reducing pendency files but will also boost their morale, sources said. In 2016, as many as 18,702 personnel were promoted by granting ""special grade designation"". This includes 9,364 head constables to assistant sub-inspectors and 933 constables to head constables. A total of 51 inspectors were also promoted to ACP, 117 sub-inspectors to inspectors, 596 ASI to sub-inspectors. Not only this: 1,923 personnel were promoted for functional requirements under the comprehensive scheme. PATNAIK 'VERY COMPETENT IN ADMINISTRATION AND INVESTIGATION'Patnaik, a 1985-batch IPS officer, will be on his post for the next three years. He was previously the special commissioner (administration) in Delhi Police.When he became the commissioner, Mail Today had reported that senior officers described Patnaik as someone who has a deep knowledge of policing and the law and order situation.""He is very competent in administration and investigation. He will make police work on the ground,"" an official said in January.Since then, sources say the top cop has kept a tight vigil on crime trends and regularly conducts meetings with the district heads to guide them on how to curb offences and solve cases.Not only has the efficiency of solving heinous crimes improved but the number of street crimes cracked by cops has also gone up. Be it snatching, burglary or motor vehicle theft, this year Delhi Police managed to solve most cases.Around 33.82 per cent of snatching cases have been solved, compared to 19.28 per cent last year.In February, as reported by MAIL TODAY, Patnaik had formed core teams, special investigation teams and law and order research teams in every district to solve all the cases.Also, special trainings are being given for better policing. The law and order research team comprises officials till inspector rank.

She has previously said the court should be ashamed if it does not improve its record on the issue. Her appointment was announced on Friday and she will take up the role on 2 October, when she will be sworn in as president. She said: ?It is a great honour and a challenge to be appointed to succeed Lord Neuberger. I look forward to building upon his pioneering achievements, including developing closer links with each part of the United Kingdom, for example by sitting outside London, and improving the ways in which we communicate our work to the public. ?Recent high-profile cases mean that more people than ever before have heard of the supreme court, and we hope that this will help to create a broader understanding of how the judiciary serves society.?Hale?s appointment was announced alongside that of Jill Black, who, after promotion from the court of appeal, becomes the second female justice in the UK?s highest court.

Neuberger said: ?I have had the pleasure of working closely with Lady Hale over the last five years, and have seen at first hand the intellect and humanity with which she approaches the appeals which come before her, as well as her commitment to the rule of law, legal education and building public understanding of the work of the courts.?For Lady Hale to become president of the institution to which she has contributed so much is a fitting pinnacle to a truly ground-breaking career.?Hale has criticised the inbuilt bias in choosing judges, and the dependence on ?soundings? from judges, as producing a judiciary that is ?not only mainly male, overwhelmingly white, but also largely the product of a limited range of educational institutions and social backgrounds?.Born in Yorkshire in 1945, she went to a state school, Richmond high school for girls, and then to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read law and graduated top of her class.Hale?s career began in academia when she joined the University of Manchester law faculty as a junior lecturer. While teaching ? and working in a pub ? she studied for the bar exams, winning the top results for her year in the bar finals. She was also the first woman and youngest person to be appointed to the Law Commission.In 1989, she was appointed Queen?s counsel and in 1994 she became a high court judge, the first to have made her career as an academic and public servant rather than as a practising barrister.In 1999, she became the second woman to be appointed to the court of appeal; Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was the first. Hale also became the first female law lord. In June 2013, she was appointed deputy president of the supreme court.Like Hale, Black is a family law specialist ? although she initially took on a broad range of criminal and civil work at the bar ? and worked in academia, having taught at then Leeds Polytechnic in the 1980s. She was raised in north Wales and studied at Durham University. Earlier this year, the 63-year-old was on a panel of appeal court judges who ruled against the government following freedom of information requests to view a former minister?s diaries. Lloyd Jones, 65, who grew up in Pontypridd, south Wales, was a ?friend of the court?, offering legal advice in the hearings into whether former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet had sovereign immunity from arrest and potential extradition to Spain over alleged human rights crimes.Briggs, 62, grew up in a naval family, following his father between ships on the south coast.

Noida police train 20 volunteers to regulate traffic,"The Noida traffic police imparted road safety training to 20 volunteers on Sunday who will assist them in reducing vehicular congestion and curbing traffic violations in their respective residential areas.Earlier in June, the traffic police had appealed to residents through social networking sites to assist them in reducing traffic congestion. Residents? welfare associations were also roped in to encourage residents to be a part of the initiative.Officials said that the volunteers will also be given reflector jackets for their safety and identification. The volunteers will mostly have to perform their duty during the peak hour when there is a high volume of traffic on city roads.On Sunday, the superintendent of police (traffic), Anil Kumar Jha interacted with the traffic volunteers at his office in Sector 14A and briefed them on their role. He assured them all assistance from the traffic police for regulating traffic movement on city roads.He also made them aware of the major traffic problems in Noida and sought their cooperation to curb them.

What he did not see, however, is that one elephant was coming towards him from the side. Before Botha knew it, he was up in the air by this elephant's trunk.Seeing this, one of the other hunters shot the elephant swinging Botha by its trunk, but they probably did not see how this could end. The wounded elephant released Botha, dropped him to the ground, and then collapsed right on top of him.Needless to say, Botha did not survive the crush.",general,1020,54,70
More time needed before reintroducing Odd-Even: Delhi govt,"The Delhi government on Tuesday asked for sufficient time to sensitise people about the Odd-even scheme before reintroducing it while proposing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the Union government to oversee cleaning of the Yamuna. The issues related to pollution were discussed in the NCR planning board meeting.Odd-even car restrictionsDelhi transport minister Satyendar Jain has urged the central government to allow sufficient time to sensitise the public about implementation of Odd-even scheme before reintroducing it. The Supreme Court had ordered to automatically enforce Odd-even formula for private cars as pollution level dips.Sources in the department said that at least a month of planning is required if the government wants to enforce the scheme. Jain met the Union urban development minister M Venakaiah Naidu during NCR planning board meeting where measures to tackle pollution were discussed.?There will be chaos on the streets if we don?t plan it. As we don?t have enough number of buses, we have to hire buses to improve public transport. Hiring buses will need a month and similarly, we also hire to civil defence volunteers to manage traffic on roads. Doing all this in 48 hours is impossible,? said a transport department official.New roadsJain also pointed out that work on Eastern and Western expressway by the DDA, which has been underway for the last 15 years, needs to be expedited.

Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. Coming from Delhi, the aggression and extreme passion for the game came naturally to him which reflected in his game as well.Sehwag though, was quite the opposite even though he hails from the same state. The Nawab of Najafgarh was always seen as a jovial character who used to sing songs while batting and made light work of the high-class bowling that he faced during his illustrious career. Even now in his career as a broadcaster, Sehwag is hilarious with his commentary and doesn't like to mince his words.Sehwag, in a recent show with Star Sports, narrated a particular story about Kohli where he revealed how he used to behave like a shy youngster in front of the seniors but was the complete opposite during his U-19 days.""He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. I've heard a lot of stories about how naughty he was him from his U-19 coach Ajit Chaudhary.""Once Chaudhary told me that Kohli fell ill or was play acting so his coach told him that he wouldn't play in the next match. And suddenly Kohli's fever went away and he became absolutely fine after hearing that, started batting normally the way he does in the nets also.

Flyers make toddlers drag luggage to avoid bag fee: Airline,"Cash-strapped holidaymakers are making their toddlers drag suitcases onboard planes to escape baggage fees, according to Ryanair bosses.Fewer passengers than ever are checking bags into the aircraft hold. Instead, travellers are avoiding charges by bringing more and more luggage into the cabin.Ryanair?s chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, said the airline could review its second bag allowance, introduced in late 2013, as passengers were starting to ?take the piss?.He said: ?I?ve seen two-year-olds wheeling a bag up to the plane as people try to take advantage.? Fewer than one passenger in six now pays to check in luggage on Ryanair. Fares have been driven down as airlines compete to fill their planes; Ryanair is forecasting a further 7% fall in the next 12 months following a 13% drop in average fares from 2016 to 2017. But it can cost more to check in a bag than purchase a seat, with prices typically up to £90 extra for a 20kg suitcase on a return short-haul summer flight. A two-year-old is entitled, like adults, to bring a 10kg suitcase and a second small bag for free. A one-year-old?s cabin allowance can also account for up to 5kg of the family?s total packing, according to a Ryanair spokesman. The airline admitted its takings were falling as passengers looked to squeeze ever more into the cabin, although it made a healthy ?443m (£396m) profit in the last three months. Sorahan said: ?We?re very generous with our cabin baggage allowance; a 10kg case and a second small carry-on. If everyone does that there?s no issue. It?s the people coming with the kitchen sink that could change the policy.?Asked by a reporter if passengers were ?taking the piss?, Sorahan said: ?Some are... The vast majority of people play by the rules but some don?t. Unfortunately some bring massive backpacks and things that don?t fit under the seat. We?ve been a little bit lax or nice ? we are victims of our own niceness.?Ryanair passengers who do arrive with oversized bags risk being told to put them in the hold and charged an extra £50 at the airport.",business,2061,59,70

Some Internet companies say it is impossible to block all such sites because many of the servers that host them are outside India. Also, the sites can still be accessed through proxy servers.However, researchers from Australia's University of Melbourne found in a study last month that young people who watch pornography, which is now easily accessible on smartphones and other devices, are more likely to sexually abuse another child or young person.Referring to ""increasing"" instances where auto drivers, bus drivers and conductors indulge in molestation and sodomy, the affidavit says, ""Limited access to persons making request to visit porn sites, may be provided (like VPN gateway server, etc) with certain conditions like: Instead of making payment to the Service providers, a hefty amount be made to the Government of India. This way, it is reflected in the bank accounts; also people like auto-drivers and people belonging to such similar strata of the society will have restricted access to online pornography. Also, it can be a great revenuegenerating model for the government.""HAVE COUNSELLORS FOR KIDS",general,3423,51,70

The animal was provided with a packet-full of fodder to eat and relax. However, the food packet somehow blocked the eyesight of the animal which made it all the more furious. Irked by this and the unbearable heat, the horse broke away from the pole it was tied to. There was panic on the street as people started running to safety from the crazy horse. As the animal reached Jacob Road in Civil Lines, it first dashed into a motorcyclist and then jumped into a car head on breaking the front windshield. Both the animal and the driver of the car, Pankaj Joshi who works for an event management company, suffered injuries, in the freak accident. Locals launched a rescue effort immediately and were later joined by a team from the forest department. While Joshi was discharged after first aid, the horse was still recuperating.""The horse reacted in such a manner due to the intense heat.

Russian pranksters dupe US official to talk about pig manure,"The US energy secretary Rick Perry has become the latest victim of a pair of Russian phone pranksters who have previously fooled Elton John into thinking he was chatting to Vladimir Putin.On this occasion, Perry believed he was discussing American coal exports with Ukraine?s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. In fact, he was talking to Vladimir Krasnov and Alexei Stolyarov, Russian pranksters who have become known for targeting celebrities and politicians with audacious stunts, energy department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes confirmed.Suspicions might have been raised when the 22-minute conversation turned to a claim by the pretend PM that the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko had invented a new biofuel made from home-brewed alcohol and pig manure, according to a translation reported in the Washington Post.The energy secretary ? who appeared to be relying on a translator during the conversation ? welcomed the idea as ?interesting?. He would be visiting Kiev in August, he told his caller. ?I look forward to visiting with the president and getting a more in-depth briefing ? If that?s the result, then he?s going to be a very, very wealthy and successful man.?Krasnov and Stolyarov are sometimes called the ?Jerky Boys of Russia?, named after an American duo who put out recordings of their prank phone calls in the 1990s. The pair famously made a prank call to Elton John, who thought he was speaking to the Russian president.?These individuals are known for pranking high-level officials and celebrities, particularly those who are supportive of an agenda that is not in line with their governments. In this case, the energy security of Ukraine,? Hynes said. During the call on 19 July, Perry, whose department oversees the US nuclear weapons program, discussed a range of topics, including sanctions against Russia and helping Ukraine develop oil and gas.He also said the Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2, a Russian project to bring natural gas to Europe across the Baltic, and that US technology could help Ukraine develop gas. ?Giving Ukraine more options with some of our technology is, I think, in everyone?s best interest ? with the exception of the Russians, but that?s OK,? he said. Perry also discussed the Paris climate accord, defending Donald Trump?s decision to withdraw the US from the agreement: ?Our position is that it?s our record that should be looked at, not whether or not we have signed on to some international accord ? The president made the decision that the cost to the United States to be in the Paris accord was not in our best interests.?The call, first reported by E&E news, was recorded and posted online. It happened about a month after Perry met with a Ukrainian delegation at the energy department.Trump said last month that Washington plans to offer Ukraine more coal exports from the United States because the eastern European nation?s industrial sector has difficulty securing coal from separatist-held regions. It is unclear how the United States would bring more coal to Ukraine but Perry hinted on the call that the commerce department was working on it. ?The coal conversation at this particular point in time is with [secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross] and I full well suspect it will go forward,? he said on the call.Reuters contributed to this report.",general,3322,60,70
19 Gurugram buildings to pay property tax over free parking,"Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. Soon afterwards, 45 sites offered free parking but now some of the owners have agreed to pay the property tax instead of offering free parking service. As a result, the list has been trimmed to 26. Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic body?s website ? www.mcg.gov.in. As reported earlier, MCG officials had reviewed the Central government?s notification regarding evaluation of property tax for commercial spaces and that to led to the civic body announcing the clause of tax waiver in lieu of free parking space.The 26 establishments offering free parking are Suncity Business Tower, Paras Twin Towers, MGF The Palm Springs Plaza, Global Foyer, Vipul Tech Square, MPD Tower, Augusta Point, Paras Downtown Tower, Central Plaza and Centrum Plaza ? all located on the Golf Course Road. On MG Road, ABW Tower, Sewa Corporate Park, Garden City Point, DLF Corporate Park, Platina Mall and Vipul Agora Mall will offer free parking. Unitech Cyber Park Sector 39, Unitech Business Zone and Nirvana Country Yard Sector 50 and Unitech Arcadia Sector 49 will also offer free parking.Omaxe City Centre, Omaxe Mall, Raheja Mall, ILD Trade Centre, Omaxe Celebration Mall and the Sapphire Mall on Sohna Road are also on the list.?The MCG had the option of levying a property tax on the basements in commercial centres, but after reading the Central government guidelines, an option was given to building owners that if they did not levy a parking fee on customers, the property tax on basements will be waived. Hence, for the public?s benefit, the MCG has placed ?free parking? boards at these sites for their awareness,? MCG Commissioner V Umashankar said.If the sites mentioned on the list are found levying a parking fee, the public can report complaints on the MCG?s toll-free number ? 1800-180-1817 ? or email to support@mcg.gov.in.",general,2262,59,70

"Who is Shayara Bano, woman behind triple talaq case in SC?","When an under-confident, middle-class woman from a small town showed the courage to demand the scrapping of unilateral pronouncement of divorce in one sitting (triple talaq) people took note.Not only because she was an unlikely candidate to have challenged a religious practice but also because many were keen to know whether she can eventually force a change despite the opposition.THE STORY OF SHAIRA37- year-old Shaira Bano has taken her triple talaq case to the Supreme Court and citing it as an 'unfair practice' she has demanded it be abolished in India. She says she was duped into accepting a post that summarily broke her home. A marriage of 15 years was dissolved in minutes unilaterally with her husband dispatching a 'talaqnama' to her while she was at her parent's place in Kashipur, Uttarakhand recuperating from an illness. Shaira recounts, ""I spoke to him over the phone last year where he said he had left me. Then one day he said he was sending some property papers and that I must accept the post. I did. And when I opened it, there lay before me a divorce deed (talaqnama).""Shaira alleges she went through a harrowing time in the last 15 years of marriage. She was mentally tortured by demands of dowry initially. After she had two children, all subsequent pregnancies were forcefully aborted by her husband. Despite all this, she never protested, just so that she could save her home and not bring disrepute to her family.'KHULA' DIVORCEWhen I asked her mother about why she let her daughter suffer and not demand a 'khula', a divorce initiated by a woman, her mother claimed she were unaware of her daughter's plight. Shaira's mother, Firoza Bano, however later confessed that the family wanted to save the marriage from breaking somehow as they feared disrepute. She said, ""Since day one he (Shaira's husband) would say I will seek talaq but we are simple people and wanted our daughter to remain settled in the marriage.""Though Shaira has an MA in Sociology she has never worked. She was always financially dependent on her husband, who offered her a paltry 'meher' amount of about 16,000 rupees at the time of talaq. It is this 'unfairness' she says she has challenged but with this she has taken on those who refuse to entertain any thought of change to the Muslim personal laws. FIGHT AGAINST TRADITIONSHer brother Arshad told us ""The Muslim Personal Law Board has filed a petition against us saying we are going against the rules of Islam and they will not allow any change.""Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Farooqi told us that the Board has filed a rejoinder to Shaira's petition. According to him, ""Personal laws cannot be tampered with or changed for one case alone. Today they will want to change talaq laws, tomorrow they will intrude into other aspects like inheritance. This is unacceptable.""The AIMPLB is not alone in its opposition. No political party is willing to push for changes in personal laws. So much so that even the BJP that has been vocal on uniform civil code skirted the issue. Minority affairs minister Nejma Heptullah said that a ""demand for change should come from within the community."" The JD(U), Congress, Samajwadi party all voiced a similar opinion.However, Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate KTS Tulsi took a different stand, ""Why can't the judiciary decide on something that is related to human right? Most Muslim countries have also done away with triple talaq, why can't we?""",general,3462,58,70

The airport will help reduce congestion at the Delhi International Airport.UP BJP HAD WRITTEN TO CIVIL MINISTRY EARLIERIn the past, according to Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Sinha, the current BJP state government in Uttar Pradesh had written to his ministry for a technical evaluation of the proposed site.The minister pointed out that there was a need to consider development of a green field airport at Jewar, since the IGI airport located here will be utilising its full passenger handling capacity in another 4-8 years time.Earlier, a technical evaluation of the proposed site at Jewar was conducted, but due to the time lapse there was a need to conduct a fresh study, Sinha said.Also Read:Udan scheme: Now you can fly to these 43 cities, see the full list here",politics,2951,59,70
"Consolidation due to Jio is ideal, says Telecom Secretary","Barcelona, Feb 26 (PTI) The fresh round of consolidation unfolding in the Indian telecom market is likely to yield five major players ensuring ""enough competition but not fragmentation of spectrum"", Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said. His comments assume significance as India -- the worlds second largest mobile services market after China -- is in the midst of massive consolidation with incumbent operators joining forces to take on aggressive newcomer Reliance Jio. The consolidation in the otherwise crowded Indian telecom industry has been hastened by Jios free voice call and data plans, forcing incumbents to slash tariff at the cost of profits. ""Dropping revenue is a concern which we are also addressing...Era of free service and falling revenue will change...In this backdrop, the investments in India are not only welcome but are also likely to be productive,"" Deepak told PTI. On consolidation playing out in the telecom market, he said, ""The way things are...this consolidation is going to be very good for India as we are likely to get four private and one government player...BSNL-MTNL...which is ideal."" Asked if the spate of buyouts would leave enough room for competition in the Indian market, Deepak said, ""Ideal is five players for India, which is what is likely to happen"". Stating that the consolidation is potentially resulting in five big players would ensure ""enough competition but not fragmentation of spectrum"", he said, it will be ""optimum for the Indian market"". Last week, Indias largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel announced acquisition of Norwegian Telenors India unit. Bharti Airtels revenue market share will rise to 35.6 per cent following the acquisition. Telenor India currently has 2.6 per cent share in Indian market. Vodafone and Idea have already said that they are considering merging their businesses in India, a move that would create the biggest telecom operator in the country with about USD 12 billion in sales.",general,1963,57,70

The Congress fought 221 and the BJP 211. Besides, the MNS contested 201 wards, the NCP 171, the BSP 109, the Samajwadi Party 76 and the Hyderabad-based AIMIM 56.Partners in the central and state governments, the Shiv Sena and the BJP opposed each other on the BMC turf because of various factors, including differences over seat-sharing.Exit polls conducted by Axis-My-India after Tuesday's elections indicated both parties secured a vote share of 32 percent each. The Congress, the survey showed, could manage 16 percent, the NCP four and the MNS eight percent.In terms of wards, the exit poll forecast 86 to 92 seats for the Shiv Sena. The BJP followed closely, with a possible victory in 80 to 88 wards, the post-election survey predicted.The Congress is likely to win 30 to 34 seats, the NCP three to six and the MNS five to seven, according to the exit poll.Official data show the Mumbai metropolis accounts for a major portion of the nation's international trade and government revenue. The BMC, figures reveal, is not just the richest municipal corporation in the country but is wealthier than one of the other three major metros by ten times.Against the BMC's budget of Rs 37,052 crore for 2016-17, the allocation for the municipal corporations of Delhi was Rs 6,919 crore, Rs 5,123.51 crore for the Greater Chennai Corporation and Rs 3,793 crore for Kolkata Municipal Corporation for the same year.Historically, Mumbai's iconic BMC has remained a Shiv Sena stronghold.The Sena, which fought past its elections in alliance with the BJP, won 75 seats in 2012 and 84 in 2007 on its own.

Farmers block trains demanding hike in land compensation,"The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration and the police on Friday lodged an FIR against 20 farmers for blocking the passage of Haldia Express train on the Delhi-Howrah railway line that passes through Greater Noida.Farmers sat on a protest at Bodaki village along Delhi-Howrah line, thereby blocking trains.Farmers have been protesting near Bil Akbarpur village for the last four months demanding increased compensation for their agricultural land earmarked for 135km Eastern Peripheral Expressway. They decided to the block railway line after the administration forcibly removed them from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway site. The expressway is meant to decongest Delhi with an aim to reduce air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Supreme Court, in 2006, had directed the Centre to build the expressway as soon as possible. The National Highways Authority of India said 17km of the expressway falls in 39 villages of Greater Noida. Farmers are demanding that instead of the Rs 3,640 per square metre compensation that they were promised, the district administration should pay them four times the prevailing circle rate. This roughly works out to Rs 7,000 per sqm.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate this EPE on August 15 and the district administration is under pressure to settle farmer disputes.

Both captains had their say on the last day of the Bengaluru Test and now they have spoken ahead of the third Test,"" said the 67-year-old. (Clarke happy India, Australia resolved DRS controversy)""Nobody spoke anything in between about it but the media, otherwise there was nothing between them (Kohli and Smith). It is time look at cricket now. A lot of good cricket that was played in the first two Tests has been swept away because of this one incident."" (Test of maturity for Kohli and Smith in Ranchi)Gavaskar added that the banter on field should be less with the mouth and more with the game. India pace spearhead Ishant Sharma, in the second rubber, mocked Smith by making faces at him which left captain Kohli in splits. (Hope Dhoni comes to watch the Test in Ranchi: Kumble)""There should be aggression but only in terms of cricket, not otherwise. Young players tend to misunderstand while expressing aggression and tend to do it with their mouths instead of the bat and ball.

UK policeman found with seized drugs worth ?6 crore at home,"A police inspector responsible for disposing of seized drugs was found with an estimated £700,000 worth of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis at his home, a trial has heard.A jury at Leeds crown court was told that Insp Keith Boots, 55, was responsible for disposing of confiscated drugs for West Yorkshire police in Bradford but instead stole large quantities to supply to others. When colleagues raided Boots?s Bradford home they found illegal drugs worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, including 11kg of cocaine in his washing machine, the court heard. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, told the jury: ?What was found on the ground floor would have kept a 1970s rock star, as well as his band, entertained for weeks.? He said the drugs found in the house were estimated to be worth £700,000 by a police expert. Greaney claimed that Boots, who had been a West Yorkshire police officer since 1990 and an inspector for more than 10 years, stole drugs from the stores he managed at Trafalgar House police station, in the centre of Bradford. His home was searched in December 2014 after a colleague noticed a quantity of cocaine missing from the station store, the court heard. ?What Keith Boots had been doing is as simple as it is wicked,? Greaney said. ?In a gross breach of trust, he had been exploiting weaknesses in the system for the destruction of controlled drugs in order to steal them.? Boots went on trial on Wednesday with his son Ashley Boots. Keith Boots denies four counts of theft, six counts of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply, one count of possessing ammunition, three counts of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, one count of conspiracy to steal and one count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Ashley Boots, 29, denies six counts of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply, one count of possessing ammunition, three counts of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, one count of conspiracy to steal and one count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Man accuses Cyber Hub pub staff of beating friends,"A visit to The Wine Company at DLF Cyber Hub, Gurgaon, turned foul for three young men, who now claim they were brutally thrashed by the bouncers here for no good reason.Suryansh Jalan wrote a review on Zomato saying that three of his friends had gone to The Wine Company on Monday night at around 10pm. A little after midnight, when they called for the bill, they noticed there were some ""inconsistencies"" in the amount charged. Jalan wrote that, at this point, the restaurant's manager was summoned, after which ""a heated, yet cordial argument"" ensued between the two parties.Ultimately, the manager accepted the restaurant's error, gave them a corrected bill, which Jalan said his friends paid and headed for the door ""as can be clearly viewed on the CCTV footage.""From here, as Jalan claims, things started going south: ""Seems like there was a misconception in the company staff, as the Manager tried to stop one of the friends by grabbing their arm, and when the individual tried to release himself from the strong grip of the Manager, around 8-10 highly aggressive, seemingly uneducated and brutish bouncers, decide to take matters into their own hands, and viciously jumped them NOT with the intent to restrict them, but rather to cause heavy and grievous harm.""Though Zomato now has taken down this review, it is still appearing on The Plunge Daily.Jalan further added that the restaurant staff ""broke several bottles on them,"" and that one of the bouncers slashed a deep cut in his friend's neck with a glass shard.

""On hearing this, the customers began misbehaving with our staff,"" said The Wine Company post. ""Our wine sommelier, who started reasoning with them, was then abused verbally, pushed across the restaurant and struck repeatedly without provocation.""The Wine Company claims that at this point, two bouncers intervened to take the three ""extremely drunk and unruly"" men out of the restaurant, with some assistance from the restaurant staff.""Once outside the premises of the restaurant, the three picked fights with passer-by's and were injured in the subsequent scuffle,"" said the post.The Wine Company also claimed that it was their restaurant manager who called the police. Here is a CCTV footage they shared of the incident:WHAT DOES ZOMATO HAVE TO SAY?Zomato is said to have taken down Suryansh Jalan's review of the incident at The Wine Company because they ""cannot allow second-hand dining experiences only or opinions based on a media report/ a third party's incident [sic].""Jalan shared a screenshot of Zomato's mail to him, in which the company ""defends"" the removal of Jalan's review on The Wine Company from their platform.In the mail, Zomato officials wrote that though the ""regret"" the ""unfortunate incident"" that happened with his friends, they won't be able to carry Jalan's review as it is against their guidelines.Here is a screenshot of Zomato's mail to Jalan:",business,3589,51,70

"Man falls into gorge, spends night clinging to tree branch","A 40-year-old person from the city was rescued a day after he fell into a 150-feet gorge at Madhe ghat in Velha taluka. He was on a trip with his friends on Sunday.Ramesh Mane, an employee of Thermax India Ltd, had gone with his group of 8-10 friends to Madhe Ghat, famous for scenic waterfall, in Velha taluka. While coming back, his friends realised that Mane was not with them, prompting a search for him. The search operation however had to be stalled due to heavy rainfall and thick fog. After realising that Mane had gone missing, his friends informed others including Thermax workers union president who in turn asked his friend Sachin Gaikwad for help. According to his friends, Mane had to spend the entire night in the deep gorge while clinging on to a tree branch. ?They were shocked, frightened and were totally clueless. I told them to contact Velha police station and register a complaint and meanwhile, I called my friend Sachin Gaikwad who is known for rescue missions. He immediately responded and reached Velha in the middle of the night,? said Dinesh Dakhave, Thermax workers union president. Gaikwad and his team reached Velha early Monday morning. ?We made two teams and started search operation in every direction of the plateau. As we climbed down the ghat, we spotted Mane in a deep gorge. He was clinging to a nearby branch and was moving abruptly. There was no way to find out whether he was dead or alive. We shouted and whistled to which he responded after several minutes,? said Gaikwad, who works for Dadoji Kondev Bouldering Gym in Kondhwa. The rescue team realised that they were short in man power, as Mane was stuck in an inaccessible spot and it was not easy to pull him out to safe area. So, Gaikwad walked back to the village and contacted Shivdurg Mitra Pratishan of Lonavala and asked for technical help. Meanwhile, one of the rescuers managed to reach Mane, so the team acted swiftly and rather than waiting for the technical team, they brought Mane out with help from local villagers. ?We were surprised when we found out Mane was not majorly injured. However, he wasn?t able to walk properly as he had fallen down almost 150-feet. So we carried him to the village where their team was ready with the vehicle.

Revenue share is 'starving' grassroots: Cricket Australia,"Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland believes the revenue-share model which the body is trying to dump in its ongoing pay negotiations with players is ""starving"" the grassroots of the game of funding.Australia faces the possibility of an embarrassing player strike or lockout if the protracted negotiation over a new five-year pay deal for country's international and state cricketers cannot be resolved by the end of June.At the heart of the dispute is the arrangement whereby the players share a fixed percentage of up to 26 percent of Cricket Australia's revenue, which Sutherland's executive team want to end.The players, through their union, have remained steadfastly opposed to such a change but Sutherland says it is essential if the grassroots of the game is to get the investment it needs.""The model was created in 1997, when players were poorly paid, but now our top male players are easily the most highly paid team sportspeople in Australia,"" he wrote in a column in The Weekend Australian on Saturday.""The main issue in 2017 is the chronic under-funding of grassroots. This will require an investment over time of many hundreds of millions of dollars and we must start now.""We believe we can achieve both a healthy increase in player payments and our grassroots funding objectives over the next few years by sensibly adapting the current player payments model.""With more than 80 percent of the country's 5,584 cricket facilities currently having no provision for women and girls, meeting the needs of female players was the sort of project desperately required, he added.Sutherland said that because the agreement was for revenue rather than profit share, any new investment Cricket Australia made would need to guarantee a 32 percent return just to break even, ""an untenable situation for any business"".""The current model of player payments has done its job, but now risks starving other vital parts of the game,"" he concluded.""That must change.""Cricket Australia has come under fire for not explaining its position clearly enough in what has been a tense standoff with the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA).The ACA on Saturday blasted Cricket Australia for ""lacking in common sense"" by refusing mediation to end the dispute and said the governing body's ""claims"" on the grassroots needed to be closely examined.""CA take 80 percent of revenue and yet blames the players for under expenditure on grassroots,"" it said on its website (www.auscricket.com.au)",sports,2479,57,70

Waitlisted passengers can now take next alternative train,"Starting April 1, passengers will be able to avail the opportunity of travelling in Rajdhani or Shatabdi trains even if they had booked tickets in other mail/express trains for the same destinations. Railways is launching a new scheme from April as part of which wait-listed passengers can get confirmed accommodation in the next alternative train if they opt for the same while booking their tickets. As per the scheme, there will be no extra charges taken from passengers or any refund provided for the difference of fare. Known as Vikalp, the alternative train accommodation scheme aims to utilise vacant berths in many premier trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and other special service such as Suvidha trains in all major routes. Railways has to forego about Rs 7,500 crore in a year in refund to customers for cancellation of tickets for various reasons. MOVEPASSENGER-FRIENDLY: RAILWAY OFFICIAL Describing the scheme as a ""passenger-friendly"" move to provide confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers in alternative trains, a senior Railway Ministry official said, ""We aim to achieve the twin objectives of providing confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers and ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation by this scheme."" After the introduction of flexi-fare system in premier trains, some berths are going vacant while at the same time many passengers could not be accommodated in other Mail/Express trains due to the huge demand. ""In any case, these berths are running vacant. So whatever we can save in refund is going to be a neat save for us. No additional cost is involved to railways so anything we save will be earnings for railways,"" the official added. Currently, railways is running the scheme on six routes including Delhi-Lucknow, Delhi-Jammu and Delhi-Mumbai sectors since November 1 on a pilot basis. SYSTEM AVAILABLE FOR ONLINE TICKETINGThe system is available for online ticketing now but it will be extended to over-the-counter sale also as the required software is being readied for the purpose. As per the scheme, wait-listed passengers of a train would be given the option of getting a confirmed accommodation in the next train running on the route. While there is a huge demand for train berths in certain sectors round the year, some routes witness increased rush during festive seasons. If a passenger opts for the Vikalp scheme while booking tickets, he will get an SMS alert on his/her mobile phone about getting the confirmed accommodation in the alternative train. The name of the passenger who has been provided accommodation in the alternative train will not figure in the wait-listed charts of their original train, the official said, adding that a separate list of passengers transferred in the alternative train will be pasted along with the confirmed and wait-list charts.(WITH INPUTS FROM PTI)",lifestyle,2874,57,70

Player who reported racial abuse banned by Italian Serie A,"Pescara midfielder Sulley Muntari has been banned for one game after he walked off the pitch at Cagliari on Sunday, having been booked for complaining to the referee about racist abuse in the crowd.Serie A's disciplinary committee also said that no action would be taken against Cagliari because only around 10 supporters were involved in abusing Muntari.Meanwhile, Lazio and Inter Milan were found guilty of racist behaviour by their fans during other games and warned they would face partial stadium closures if there was a repeat.The committee said that Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was the target of racist chanting by Inter fans while Lazio supporters targeted AS Roma defender Antonio Ruediger.Ghanaian midfielder Muntari said he suffered abuse throughout his side's 1-0 defeat at Cagliari but was booked for dissent when he asked the match official to stop the game.The 32-year-old walked off the pitch in protest shortly afterwards and was then given a second yellow card and sent off.The committee confirmed an automatic one-match ban, saying Muntari's second yellow was for ""abandoning the pitch without the referee's permission"".The committee described the chanting as deplorable but said it came from a part of the stadium occupied by 2,000 fans and that only around 10 were involved, not enough to warrant a punishment against the club under Serie A rules.It said that around 80 percent of the 7,000 Inter fans in one of the upper tier sections of the San Siro aimed insults at Senegal defender Koulibaly and a similar number of fans in one section of Lazio's Curva Nord aimed insults at Germany's Ruediger.In both cases, the tribunal ordered the sectors to be closed for one game if there was a repeat incident within the next year.Earlier, the world players' union FIFPro had called on Serie A to rescind Muntari's first yellow card.",general,1853,58,70

The director has been identified as Nishant Mukul, 43, and the CEO as Ritik Kumar Sinha. Tehsildar Dadri PL Maurya said the duo was served several notices by deputy labour commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar to pay labour cess, which is meant for the welfare of labourers, but the group did not pay any heed. ?The labour department issued a recovery certificate for the recovery of the amount and I conducted searches at the office of the Amrapali Group along with the police,?

Philippine Prez Duterte threatens to bomb tribal schools,"The Philippine president has sparked alarm among human rights groups after he threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to become communist rebels.In a televised news conference on Monday, Rodrigo Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying bridges and torching schools in the countryside but said they were sparing indigenous Lumad schools, which he alleged were operating under rebel control without government permits. ?Get out of there, I?m telling the Lumads now. I?ll have those bombed, including your structures,? the president said. ?I will use the armed forces, the Philippine air force. I?ll really have those bombed ? because you are operating illegally and you are teaching the children to rebel against government.? Human rights groups called on him to retract the threat, warning such an attack would constitute a war crime. US-based Human Rights Watch said international humanitarian law ?prohibits attacks on schools and other civilian structures unless they are being used for military purposes?, adding that deliberate attacks on civilians, including students and teachers, ?is also a war crime?.Leftwing lawmaker Emmi de Jesus of the Gabriela Women?s party asked Duterte to retract the threat, saying government troops may use it as a pretext to attack indigenous schools and communities in the country?s south that have come under threat from pro-military militias in recent years. Angered by recent communist rebel attacks on government forces, including a road gun battle last week that wounded five members of his elite presidential guards, Duterte has called off peace talks with the Maoist guerrillas and threatened their perceived sympathisers. ?By calling for an attack on schools Duterte is directing the military to commit war crimes,? said Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch. Conde urged Duterte to sign a 2015 international political statement, the Safe Schools Declaration, that commits governments to supporting the protection of students, teachers and schools in times of armed conflict. Duterte ascended to the presidency in 2016 after campaigning on his extra-tough approach on crime as a prosecutor and later as mayor of southern Davao city. He has remained popular despite thousands of deaths in his nationwide anti-drug crackdown, and his continuing popularity and the ineffective opposition have apparently emboldened him. On Monday night Duterte also called for abolishing the Commission on Human Rights, an independent agency created under the constitution. He demanded that the commission and the government ombudsman, who investigates officials for corruption and other infractions, route requests to investigate police and military personnel through him, and laid down conditions under which he would allow those investigations. Duterte said that if the ombudsman failed to address atrocities committed by insurgents on government forces, ?so that you can get the truth and the whole story, then do not investigate my army and police.?",world,3010,56,70

The news of its sighting had come soon after villagers in Haryana?s Sohna district had thrashed a leopard to death.Many experts have criticised the government?s decision to relocate arguing it has shorn the Yamuna Park of the rare achievement of having a complete food chain. Even the environment ministry guidelines released in 2011 observe that ?arbitrary removal of leopards could lead to increased conflict?.",general,1534,58,70

Air India's missing painting arrives at head office,"On July 5th, India Today had reported that a painting, 'Flying Apsara', made by eminent painter Jatin Das for Air India in 1991 had gone missing from the airline's archives. Das had stumbled upon information that the painting made exclusively for the national carrier, had reached the open market.The ""missing"" painting now has miraculously resurfaced.A mysterious package arrived at Air India's head office, Airlines House, in New Delhi a week after Das raised a stink about the missing painting.This unnamed package contained the same said painting that Das had made for Air India. It was rolled up and delivered in a damaged condition.Air India immediately tried to trace back the sender. The courier, unfortunately, had been sent from an address in Gurugram that turned out to be fictitious.After India Today had highlighted the art loot, that appeared to be a larger malaise than the case of one missing painting, Air India had set up an internal enquiry committee to look into the matter.The committee has learnt that the painting was last seen in the office of a former executive director who worked out of the Delhi office of the airline a decade ago. It appeared, the lady in question, had left with Das' painting, post retirement.This former executive director has now been questioned about the painting. The internal committee will submit its complete report to the CMD of Air India in a week's time.This latest discovery only reaffirms what has been known within the airline's circles for a while - that retiring executives/officials have left with many a precious paintings and artefacts from the airline's collection after retirement, without informing.Air India says it has started a process of detailed audit of its collection, which will include ""physical verification, digitisation, cataloguing, classification, proper storage, and putting in place a security system"".When India Today contacted Jatin Das, he said he was yet to hear from Air India about 'Flying Apsara' and his other paintings too that he's sought details on.",general,2044,51,70

India signs pact to check tax evasion by multinational firms,"New Delhi, Jun 7 (PTI) India today signed the OECD multilateral convention that aims to check cross-border tax evasion by multinational companies. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley signed the multilateral convention in Paris to implement tax treaty- related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting. More than 65 countries, including India, signed the convention. More countries are expected to sign the convention in coming days, a finance ministry statement said. ""The Convention will modify Indias treaties in order to curb revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created,"" the statement added. The Multilateral Convention is an outcome of the OECD/G20 Project to tackle Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) which is resorted to by MNCs through tax planning strategies by exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules. It helps them artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations, resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. The BEPS Project identified 15 actions to address BEPS in a comprehensive manner, the statement said. India was part of the Ad Hoc Group of more than 100 countries and jurisdictions from G20, OECD, BEPS associates and other interested countries, which worked on an equal footing on the finalisation of the text of the Multilateral Convention, starting May, 2015. The Convention enables all signatories to meet treaty- related minimum standards that were agreed as part of the final BEPS package, including the minimum standard for the prevention of treaty abuse under Action 6.",general,1717,60,70

Cars may predict if driver is having a heart attack,"Washington, Jun 13 (PTI) Scientists are developing a new system that can predict if a car driver is about to have a heart attack, a feature that would help avoid road accidents due to an unexpected cardiac event. When a person has a medical emergency behind the wheel, fellow passengers and motorists also face risk of death or serious injury. ""A large number of traffic incidents are caused by medical conditions while driving, specifically cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infraction and myocardial ischemia,"" said Kayvan Najarian, from University of Michigan in the US. ""The medical event interferes with the drivers ability to safely drive and operate the car, causing the accident,"" said Najarian. Researchers, in collaboration with Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota, wanted to move towards technology that can monitor and analyse the physiology of the person driving and predict if they are going to have adverse cardiac events. ""We identified the challenges, potential solutions, hardware options and algorithmic approaches that could be potentially used,"" Najarian said. ""We concluded that cardiac events were conditions that are more feasible to detect with technology in the vehicle,"" he added. Researchers are creating a system that could be placed in the vehicle to monitor and predict an adverse cardiac event. ""We would like to test hardware we had previously identified, and improve and validate our algorithmic solutions to see what it will take to generate a system that could look at the physiology of a person, provided by high-density electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, as well as other medical measurements,"" Najarian said. Their goal is to come up with a system that would predict the occurrence of adverse cardiac events in real time. Researchers are using machine-learning models to analyse the data collected from in-hospital and in-vehicle subjects. The research team will then test the system on real-time prediction of cardiac events. ""There are actually quite a few obstacles that were identified,"" Najarian said. ""You cant have clinical-grade monitoring devices in the vehicle. You need to use a high-quality monitoring device in the vehicle that, despite all the in-vehicle noise, could reliably register the drivers ECG without being large and obtrusive,"" he added. The research team will begin gathering the physiological data from the driver using heart monitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Such monitors are patches placed on the drivers chest that analyse physiological data in real time.",general,2564,51,70

Use of astrologers for poll results a violation of law: EC,"exit polls: EC New Delhi, Mar 30 (PTI) The prediction of election results by astrologers and tarot readers in the period when there is a ban on broadcasting exit polls is a violation of law, the Election Commission has ruled today. It asked the media, both electronic and print, to ""refrain"" from airing and publishing such programmes in future elections during the prohibited period to ensure free, fair and transparent elections. In an advisory sent to the media organisation, the poll watchdog pointed to Section 126 A of the Representation of the People Act which states that ""no person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print and electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period as may be notified by the Election Commission...""

"India's ego, hegemonic ambitions sparked tensions: China","India?s ?bloated self-assertiveness? made it infringe on China?s sovereignty and New Delhi had levelled false allegations and accusations against Beijing to serve its hegemonic ambitions, a stinging commentary from the official Chinese media said on Monday evening.The commentary, released by the official Xinhua news agency , said India first levelled false allegations about Chinese encroachment of its territory but later changed the tone to say Indian troops had gone into Doklam (or Donglang) region to ?protect? Bhutan.The piece by Xinhua was the latest in a series of articles and opinion pieces in the state media criticising India for the three-week-old standoff at the strategic tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China. India has said its troops acted in coordination with the Bhutan government to prevent the construction of a road by Chinese troops in the Donglang or Doklam region, which is claimed by Thimphu. China has accused Indian troops of trespassing into its territory.The commentary made specific reference to defence minister Arun Jaitley?s comment that the India of today is different from what it was 1962, when it was defeated in a border war by China.?Bluffing about a potential clash that could be similar to that 55 years ago when India's military suffered a bitter defeat, Indian Defence Minister Arun Jaitley said, ?India in 2017 is different from India in 1962?, implying the country's improved military strength and bloated self-assertiveness,? the commentary said.It added: ?On the other hand, Jaitley should not ignore China's unwavering and consistent stance which has continued over the last five decades and its firm belief in the international justice that no country can pursue its security at the cost of another country's sovereignty.?The commentary said that since the Indian soldiers ?crossed? into Chinese territory and obstructed work on a road in Doklam in June, China had lodged a series of protests demanding that India immediately pull back its troops. ?However, New Delhi views both the incident and its actions quite differently,? it said.?In order to illegally install its troops on Chinese soil for as long as possible and achieve a fait accompli, India firstly claimed its border had been encroached by China. After realising its own false allegation was ridiculous, it changed its tone to its actions to being in the name of ?protecting? Bhutan,? it added.?India, who calls Bhutan an ?ally?, said it had intervened on behalf of its neighbour, yet the true subtext is the South Asian giant wants to maintain and expand regional hegemony,? it said.The Doklam area, under Chinese control, is claimed by Bhutan.But the commentary said: ?The Doklam area has long been recognised as Chinese sovereign territory with a clear history and legal basis, so there is absolutely no reason for India's incursion.?The commentary made no mention of what India has argued and expressed concerns about.New Delhi has said it reached an agreement with Beijing in 2012 that the ?tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries will be finalised in consultation with the concerned countries?. Any attempt to unilaterally determine the tri-junction points is a ?violation of this understanding?, the external affairs ministry said last week.The ministry?s statement added that India and China had also reached an understanding in 2012 on the ?basis of the alignment? of the boundary in Sikkim sector and that the finalisation of the frontier was being discussed by the Special Representatives on the border issue.",world,3568,56,70

685 potholes filled by MMRDA in Mumbai this month,"The heavy rains that lashed Mumbai last week caused numerous potholes across the island city and the suburbs, which led to hellish commutes for lakhs of Mumbaiites. Officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is in charge of maintaining both the city?s highways, claimed they were filling in craters during the dry spell.The MMRDA said it fixed 353 potholes on the Western Express Highway, which were reported between July 1 and July 10, last week. In the next two days, 70 more potholes found on the highway were filled. Between July 1 and July 18, 212 potholes were filled on Eastern Express Highway, an official said.Dilip Kawathkar, joint project director, MMRDA, said, ?Since then there have been around 50 potholes found on the main carriageway of both the roads. Since there is a dry spell now, we are filling the potholes regularly.??In the past five to six days there have been many potholes found on the two express highways. We are consolidating figures from contractors and also seeing to it that they are filled in,? said an engineer, who did not wish to be named. While officials claim that they have been fixing potholes regularly, questions are being raised about the outdated technology and faulty methods being used. Many residents and activists complained that instead of cold-mix technology, MMDRA was using paver blocks to fix potholes. They also said MMRDA?s response times were slow.?Cold mix is used to fill potholes, but as soon as it rains heavily the mix washes away. At certain places we have used paver blocks. Though it is not a standard practice, in our experience it lasts longer,? the engineer said.

Plane built for Russian airline may be next US Air Force One,"Facing pressure from President Donald Trump to cut the cost of new Air Force One aircraft, the US Air Force is negotiating with Boeing to purchase two 747-8 jetliners that were built for a Russian airline that went bankrupt before they were delivered.?We?re working through the final stages of coordination to purchase two commercial 747-8 aircraft and expect to award a contract soon,? said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek, who declined to elaborate on the details.National security publication Defense One, which first reported the negotiations, said the Air Force was believed to be getting a good deal on the aircraft, which sell for about $386 million on average.The two aircraft were initially ordered four years ago by Transaero, a Russian airline that went bankrupt in 2015, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.Boeing built two 747-8s out of an order of four. But the airline never took ownership of them, and the planes have been stored in the Mojave Desert, where the dry, hot climate slows corrosion, Defense One said.Trump rattled Boeing in December before taking office by saying in a Twitter message: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.

The Air Force has estimated it would spend $2.87 billion through 2021 for development of a new presidential aircraft. The cost of refitting the commercial 747-8s with the enhanced electronics and security systems required for Air Force One were unclear.Boeing had said it expected to add the Air Force One jets to its backlog, which currently numbers 20 planes - five passenger models and 15 freighters.The redeployment to the Air Force of jets already built for another customer would effectively reduce Boeing?s future 747 production plans by two aircraft.

Lalu's family charged under Benami Act; properties seized,"The Income Tax Department has conclusive evidence that RJD Chief kin laundered money by acquiring benami properties with help of known data entry operators.Sources said Income Tax Department has conclusive proof to show that Lalu's son and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi, Tej, daughter Misa Bharti and her husband Sailesh have allegedly indulged in large scale money laundering. The Income Tax department has attached 12 plots of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife, son and daughters and charged them under the Benami Transactions Act in connection with its probe into land deals worth Rs 1,000 crore and tax evasion.They have taken accommodation entries through known entry operators SK Jain and Virender Jain with the help of CA Rajesh Agarwal. As per the department the properties have been acquired through cash or kind acquired through quid pro quo. I-T Department has served notices of attachment of assets to Misa Bharti and her husband Shailesh Kumar, his wife and former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi, Tejashwi Yadav and daughters Chanda and Ragini Yadav.The department has attached immovable assets such as land, plots and buildings in Delhi and Patna which bear a ""deed"" value of Rs 9.32 crore but the taxman has estimated their current market value at Rs 170-180 crore.A total of nine plots in Phulwari Sharif in Patna, where a mall is reported to have been coming up, has also been attached by the tax department. According to the sources, Rabri's brother Prabhu Nath Singh allegedly got a plot of land, with two-storey structure near Phulwari Sharif at very cheap rates as quid pro quo. After a few years the property was given to Lalu's son in as a gift. Later a person called Amit Katyal purchased the property at a very high rate from them in his company named A K Infosys. Later Lalu's kin purchased all the shares of the company at the face value. This transaction made them the alleged benami owner of the property.During an extensive probe into the matter I-T Department had detected an obligation chain through cash or kind. I-T had carried out surveys in at least 22 places in NCR alone recently. The probe has now revealed that the transactions have been made in a circuitous manner through the help of known accommodation entry operators, who have been arrested by Enforcement Directorate recently.Their balance sheets, books of accounts and ledger don't match indicating poor accounting practices. Consequently they have left behind a trail of benami transactions. ""They have made transactions through persons who are known for unfair practices.

Delhi body initiates measures to improve air quality,"Taking stock of the air pollution in Delhi and the neighbouring states, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Friday asked officials to immediately enforce the graded response action under ?very poor? category for Delhi and ?moderate poor? for NCR.?Air quality for Delhi is very poor. Measures falling under this category of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have to be taken,? EPCA member and head of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Sunita Narain said.The EPCA, however, in its first meeting on GRAP refrained from strict enforcements, like banning the diesel generators and hiking the parking fee ? the measures that fall under the ?very poor? category. The temporary relaxation according to the EPCA members is to give enough time to the authorities and people to get prepared.Read | Delhi?s air pollution ?very serious? problem, find solution at the earliest, says SC?It was, however, decided to levy heavy fines on the violators, such as wrong parking.In the meeting, it was also decided to completely revamp the brick kilns to reduce the air pollution by next winter through essential low-cost methods.?There are many brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana, which have not yet adopted to the low-polluting methods, such as zig-zag chimneys.

The enforcement has to be done through different government offices, including state and central pollution control boards, state secretaries, transport department and the civic bodies.There are different categories under the GRAP, which applies when particulate matters -- PM 10 and PM 2.5 (particles in air with diameter less than 10 and 2.5 mm) -- are pushed beyond a limit. For very poor, the PM 2.5 ranges between 121-250 units or PM 10 level is between 351-430 units.

Wikipedia bans editing of font's page over Nawaz Sharif row,"The daughter of Pakistan?s prime minister has become subject of ridicule in her home country after forensic experts cast doubts on documents central to her defence against corruption allegations.Mariam Nawaz Sharif is under supreme court investigation after the 2016 Panama Papers leak tied her to a purchase of high-end London property acquired through offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands.The unlikely source of this latest controversy, in a scandal that has gripped Pakistan for more than a year, is a font designed by Microsoft.Documents claiming that Mariam Nawaz Sharif was only a trustee of the companies that bought the London flats, are dated February 2006, and appear to be typed in Microsoft Calibri.But the font was only made commercially available in 2007, leading to suspicions that the documents are forged.Social media users have derided Sharif for this apparent misstep, coining the hashtag #fontgate.According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia, the Calibri font was developed in 2004 but only reached the general public on 30 January 2007 with the launch of Microsoft Vista and Microsoft Office 2007.The Wikipedia Calibri page usually receives about 500 visits per day. On July 11 and 12 combined, it received about 150,000.After users seemingly tried to change the article?s content to say the font was available from 2004, Wikipedia suspended editing on its Calibri page ?until July 18 2017, or until editing disputes have been resolved?.One supporter hailed the move, saying people seeking to edit the page ?are trying to save a corrupt political party on corruption charges?. Others praised Wikipedia for its quick response and said it was proof of the company?s integrity.Opposition parties have urged prime minister Nawaz Sharif to step down after the investigation found a ?significant disparity? between his family?s declared wealth and known sources of income.Opposition leader Imran Khan said Sharif had ?lost all moral authority? and must resign immediately.Sharif has denied wrongdoing and said his family?s wealth was acquired legally.",world,2083,59,70
Can't believe a normal hug with Salman was trending: Sana,"Actor Sana Khan was up for a not-so-pleasant surprise on Tuesday, when a video of her hugging actor Salman Khan went viral for all the wrong reasons.

What made it news was Salman?s closed fists, and his shy smile. ?I still can?t believe that a normal hug was trending, trolling, and rolling,? says Sana. ?People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had a closed fist, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug.?

[Then] he complimented me that I look very nice. And I said, ?Yes, I?ve dropped 7kg?, and he is like, ?It?s showing,?? reveals Sana.Was it the backless outfit that made the hug look ?awkward?? Sana says, ?Well, could be. Maybe he didn?t want my back bronzer to fall on his clothes.

Maha ATS releases video to check online radicalisation,"In a first, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has created a video aimed at making parents aware about the dangers of online radicalisation. The video, which India Today has accesed, has is part of a campaign that the ATS plans to run with the help of celebrities. The video begins with a set of parents talking about the high hopes they have of their son and how they believe that the extended hours he spends on the internet will help him become an engineer. The parents express happiness that their son is always on his laptop, browsing the internet. Cutaways, however, show the boy coming across videos tutoring youth on how to make bombs. The video also shows the boy transferring funds to 'SYRIA', which viewers are presumably supposed to under to mean the Islamic State.An ATS team is then seen visiting the parents and telling them what their son has been actually up to online. The video ends with Sharad Kelkar, a Bollywood and television celebrity, asking parents and friends to be responsible and keep a tab on what their children/friends are doing online.Over the last few years, the Maharashtra ATS has dealt with a lot of cases where youngsters have been radicalised online and brought into the Islamic State fold. Dealing with such cases, the agency has concluded that online radicalisation is three times more effective and faster than physical indoctrination. However, keeping the complexity in mind the Maharashtra ATS has initiated a policy under which parents are requested to come forward and inform them if they see any changes in the behaviour of their children and if they find them suddenly spending a lot of time on the internet. Under the policy, ATS will not take any legal action against the children but will instead help with counseling to deradicalise them. The Maharashtra ATS has also gotten in touch with community leaders to bring the youths back into the mainstream society. Identity of youths who have been deradicalised is kept confidential. The video is another step by the agency to help expand its intelligence while stopping radicalised youths from taking any extreme steps.",general,2126,54,70

Customers should report fraud in 3 days to avoid losses: RBI,"Customers will not suffer any loss if unauthorised electronic banking transactions are reported within three days and the amount involved will be credited in the accounts concerned within 10-days, the Reserve Bank said on Thursday. In case the third party fraud is reported with a delay of four to seven working days, a customer will face liability of up to Rs 25,000. However, in cases where the loss is due to negligence by the account holder (such as sharing of payment credentials), the customer will bear the entire loss until the unauthorised transaction is reported to the bank. Any loss occurring after reporting of the unauthorised transaction will be borne by the bank, RBI said while issuing revised directions on Customer Protection Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions. RBI said the revised directions are being issued amidst recent surge in customer grievances relating to unauthorised transactions resulting in debits to their accounts/cards. REPORT FRAUD WITHIN 7 DAYS OR ELSE...There will be ""zero liability of a customer"" in case of third party breach where the deficiency lies ""neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system"". However, the customer will have to notify the bank within three working days of receiving the communication from the bank regarding the unauthorised transaction. A customer's entitlement to zero liability will also arise where the unauthorised transaction occurs due to ""contributory fraud/negligence/deficiency on the part of the bank (irrespective of whether or not the transaction is reported by the customer)"", RBI said. The maximum liability of a customer will be Rs 25,000 in cases where the responsibility for the unauthorised electronic banking transaction lies neither with the bank nor with the customer, but lies elsewhere in the system and when there is a delay of four to seven working days. If the fraud is report after seven days, the customer liability will be determined as per the bank's board approved policy. The maximum liability of a savings bank account customer will be Rs 10,000 in such cases. Referring to reversal timeline for Zero Liability/ Limited Liability of customer, RBI said the bank should credit (shadow reversal) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer's account within 10 working days of reporting of the fraud.

TRAI plans rules for new telcos after Reliance Jio: Report,"New Delhi, Apr 27 (PTI) Telecom regulator TRAI plans to start by May this year industry-wide consultation on framing rules for new mobile operators testing their services prior to full-fledged commercial launch. The issue of specific framework for trial services had cropped-up last year after newcomer Reliance Jios stormy entry into the telecom sector. The incumbent cellular operators had demanded that the dos and donts of such trial service needs to be clearly spelt out. The upcoming consultation paper is expected to address issues like the number of subscribers that can be on-boarded during the trial period by a new operator, as also the duration for such network and service testing. Other issues could be whether the services can be given free of charge or not. The consultation paper on the issue is likely to be issued by May, two people familiar with the matter told PTI. It may be recalled that the cellular operators body COAI had, last year, alleged that the new entrant Reliance Jio was attempting to acquire customers by offering connection loaded with freebies, in the guise of a trial launch. Reliance Jio, in turn, accused incumbent players like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone of not releasing sufficient interconnection ports even during its test run of services.",general,1284,58,70
Need battery-run cars and buses to check pollution: Kejriwal,"Battery-operated buses and cars could soon be a reality in the Capital with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying on Saturday that his government was exploring the idea.Addressing e-rickshaw drivers at an event organised by the government for the payment of subsidy to them, Kejriwal said there was a need to reduce the number of diesel and petrol-run vehicles to check pollution. ?We want more vehicles should run on battery and electricity so that the number of diesel and petrol vehicles could be reduced. At present, pollution is the biggest problem in Delhi,? he added. The government had flagged off one e-bus last year on a trial basis for six months. Talking about the e-rickshaw drivers whose number in the Capital has risen to over one lakh, the chief minister said they are doing a favour for the people of Delhi as their vehicles help fight pollution. The subsidy of Rs 15,000 and Rs 30,000 is intended to promote these eco-friendly three-wheelers mostly used by commuters for short distances or last mile connectivity. The Delhi government in its current financial year budget earmarked Rs 1.06 crore for providing subsidy to e-rickshaw owners. In total, around 6,000 applicants were given financial aid.To avail of the scheme, e-rickshaw drivers can submit the required documents to the transport department till July 22. Subsequently, the government will transfer the subsidy amount to their bank account by July 31.Last month, the transport department had made Aadhaar card details compulsory for those seeking subsidy on e-rickshaws registered in the city, in order to ?prevent duplicacy? in grant of the financial assistance.",general,1643,60,70

"Sasikala was allowed 23 jail visits, instead of 8: RTI","Even as a controversy over undue privileges accorded to AIADMK leader VK Sasikala at the Bengaluru Central Prison continues to rage on, a Right to Information (RTI) response has revealed that she was allowed a whopping 23 visits from February 16 ? the date of her incarceration ? to June 16.She met as many as 48 visitors during these visits.This is in violation of prison rules, which clearly stipulate that a convict is allowed just one visit in a fortnight. Ideally, Sasikala should have benefited from just eight visits till June 15.Sasikala and two of her relatives ? Elavarasi and Sudhakaran ? were imprisoned on the orders of the Supreme Court in a disproportionate assets case earlier this year.The prison department?s response, a copy of which is with HT, revealed that even Elavarasi was allowed 10 visits during this period. The three met as many as 82 people in just four months.Speaking to HT, RTI activist T Narasimha Murthy said allowing Sasikala and her relatives additional visits amounts to gross violation of rules. ?It is a known fact that poor inmates in the jail are not extended such privileges,? he added.Former deputy inspector general of police (prisons) Roopa D Moudgil had highlighted alleged violations at the Bengaluru prison on July 12. In a report, she said there were accusations that Sasikala had paid a bribe of Rs 2 crore to senior police officers ? including then director general of police (prisons) HN Sathyanarayana Rao. Subsequently, the state instituted a probe headed by retired Indian Administrative Services officer Vinay Kumar.Meanwhile, both Moudgil and Rao were transferred ?to ensure a fair investigation?.After visiting the jail, Kumar told reporters on Wednesday that he would not be able to comment on the terms of the inquiry and the timeline for submitting the report. ?The home department may inform the public once it is submitted,? he said.Murali Karnam, a researcher who has studied the condition of jails across India, said inequality in prison is just a reflection of the inequality that exists outside. ?Special privileges are sometimes accorded to wealthier prisoners by default, even without the payment of a bribe,? he added.Former director general of police (prisons) ST Ramesh said any information about Sasikala being allowed the alleged privileges was likely to influence public opinion. ?Even assuming that no bribe was paid, it would have been ideal if the prison department was more open. It should have informed the public about the pressures faced by them while handling a high-profile prisoner,? he added.",general,2579,55,70

"Bible, Quran removed from Abdul Kalam's Tamil Nadu memorial","Indian authorities have removed a copy of the Bible and the Quran from a new statue of a former president after a complaint by a Hindu nationalist party, officials said Tuesday.The removal of the books has fuelled a religious row over a carving depicting a Hindu holy book placed next to the statue of APJ Abdul Kalam at Rameswaram in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.Kalam, who as a scientist played a leading role in India?s landmark 1998 nuclear weapons tests, was president from 2002-2007 and a strongly secular figure.The sculpted Hindu Bhagvad Gita book was placed next to the statue before it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week on the second anniversary of Kalam?s death.Relatives placed the Bible and the Quran next to the Gita in protest. That infuriated the Hindu Makka Katchi nationalist party, which said it made the complaint to police.?The authorities removed the Bible and the Quran at the site.

World's only floating national park is in India,"A proposition to travel to the North East is always exciting, and Manipur is a place that provides a gateway to this picturesque part of the country. Most of us have heard about the iconic Loktak Lake, located in Bishnupur district, at a distance of 53km from Imphal. More so, because it is considered to be the largest freshwater lake in the eastern part of India. It is known among travellers and photographers due to the round-shaped floating swamps, called Phumdis in the local language.But that's not all that this lake has. Very few travellers are aware of Keibul Lamjao, which is the only floating national park in the world. Accessible only by the dugout canoes, this green beauty is perched in the middle of the Loktak Lake. This forest is home to the sangai, or the brow-antlered deer, which is one of the most endangered species of deer in the world. The sangai is the state animal of Manipur and is an important part of the sociocultural life of the people. There is even an annual festival of dance and music that is named after this rare animal. According to a census done in April 2014, the total number of sangais in Keibul stood at 204. If media reports are to be believed, the number fell in 2015, but it's not confirmed as the forest officials didn't have enough funds to carry out a head count that year.

A special drive should be initiated to persuade them to join the party,? the leader said.

In the first phase, the district or block level leaders will prepare a list. Thereafter, a detailed strategy will be chalked out for further course of action.

Therefore, a significant number of women in the age group of 18-25 years are not actively involved in political activities.

Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's passport revoked,"The passport of controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, wanted in connection with alleged terror funding cases, was on Tuesday revoked at the request of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), officials said.The officials of the probe agency said the travel document was revoked by the Regional Passport Office of Mumbai after 51-year-old Naik failed to respond to a showcause notice issued to him for personal appearance by July 13.The notice was served asking Naik why his passport should not be revoked in view of various investigations pending against him, they said.He is being probed for terror and money laundering charges by the NIA. He fled from India on July 1, 2016 after terrorists in neighbouring Bangladesh claimed that they were inspired by his speeches on waging jihad.According to ?Middle East Monitor?, an online news portal on developments in Middle East, Naik has already been granted citizenship of Saudi Arabia. There was no independent verification to this so far.Naik had his passport renewed in January last year and it has a validity for 10 years.The NIA, on November 18, 2016, had registered a criminal case against Naik at its Mumbai branch under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.His organisation, Islamic Research Foundation (IRF), has already been declared as an unlawful association by the government a day prior to registering of the case.The controversial preacher is accused of spreading hatred by his provocative speeches, funding terrorists and laundering several crores of rupees over the years.The sources could not give the exact country where Naik could be at present and said that he may be changing his base quite frequently after the NIA moved the Interpol for issuance of a Red Corner Notice (RCN), international arrest warrant, against him.The Interpol was approached against Naik after a year- long probe during which the NIA gathered evidence of his IRF and Peace TV being used to allegedly promote hatred between different religious groups.The central government has already banned his NGO and taken his TV channel off air. During the probe, the NIA claimed to have found 37 properties owned by Naik and companies run by him, which are estimated to be worth more than Rs 100 crore.A special NIA court in Mumbai, while issuing a non- bailable warrant against Naik, had said that ?there are reasonable grounds to believe that Naik is evading arrest and that he will not voluntarily appear before the court or before the agency.?The NIA alleged that Naik has been promoting enmity and hatred between different religious groups in India through his speeches and lectures on various platforms and inciting Muslim youths and terrorists in India and abroad to commit terrorist acts.",general,2774,46,70

Ensure street dogs are not a nuisance while feeding them: HC,"New Delhi, Jul 30 (PTI) Feeding or sheltering stray dogs in the common area of a private property can cause nuisance, the Delhi High Court has said, warning two south Delhi residents to ensure that the canines do not cause fear or discomfort to others. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the two respondents that they cannot be permitted to keep stray dogs in the common driveway of a private property which was jointly owned by others, if their neighbours did not approve. The court also said in a recent order that the two cannot feed the dogs or chain them in the driveway. The bench said it was the duty of the two ""to ensure that the stray dogs do not cause any nuisance to the other residents within the same property and in the neighbourhood"". The court noted that keeping stray dogs would ""cause fear and discomfort"" to others living or coming there ""who are not accustomed to keeping pet dogs"". ""The nuisance caused by the conduct of respondent nos.3 and 4 (the two individual respondents) in sheltering the stray dogs in the common driveway in the present case is writ large from the photographs placed on record. ""To a person, who is not accustomed to keeping pet dogs, it also causes fear and discomfort to walk into a property where stray dogs are kept either chained or let loose,"" it said. The bench said it ""rues the lack of civic sense and concern exhibited"" by the two towards their fellow inhabitants in their immediate neighbourhood. ""Their concern for the stray dogs also appears to us to be superficial and lacks commitment. Otherwise, the dogs would not have been left in such unhygienic and filthy conditions, as appear from the photographs on record,"" the bench said. It directed them to ""stop chaining, feeding or sheltering the stray dogs in the driveway of the aforesaid property. It shall also be the obligation of respondent nos.3 and 4 to ensure that the said dogs do not defecate in the driveway, and if they do so, it shall be their responsibility to clean up the same."" It directed the Station House Officer of Malviya Nagar police station, under whose jurisdiction the property fell, to ensure strict compliance of this order. The order came on the plea by one Om Prakash Saini, who jointly holds the property with the two respondents, claiming that keeping and feeding the stray dogs in the common driveway was ""causing immense nuisance and harassment for the other residents"". The court has listed the matter for further hearing on September 1. The order comes in the backdrop of a January order of the Supreme Court which categorically said ""stray dogs have a right to live."" During that hearing, the apex court had reacted sharply when a submission was made that such canines should be completely eliminated across the country.",general,2786,60,70

Govt taking realistic steps for affordable housing: Parekh,"Mumbai, Apr 30 (PTI) A large number of big corporates and reputed developers are entering the affordable housing segment, attracted by huge tax benefits and reforms initiated by the government, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said. He also expressed hope that real estate prices would decline more once RBI allows banks and housing finance firms to lend to developers for land purchases and approval processes for projects are further streamlined and shortened. Lauding the NDA government for coordinated efforts of the Prime Ministers Office with various ministries and departments on the Housing for All by 2022 mission, Parekh said this has been one of the main promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several steps have been taken, especially this year, to achieve this goal. ""I will call this years Budget an affordable housing budget. I am very excited about housing growth in India in next 3-5 years and I have never been so enthused about it,"" Parekh told PTI in an interview. Parekh, Chairman of housing finance major HDFC Ltd, said the government is focusing on ""practical and realistic steps"" which are good for developers, consumers and even the lenders. Speaking in detail about various schemes and measures, Parekh said the government has extended the 100 per cent tax deduction scheme for affordable housing projects approved between June 2016 and March 2019, by two more years till 2021. ""What this effectively means is that any developer, for affordable housing project, has to pay zero tax. I do not know of any industry in India where you have to pay zero tax even if you make profit, other than in affordable housing. ""It shows the importance, the urgency and the critical need that housing requires in a vast country like ours,"" he said. Parekh also said that a clear carpet area definition has been put in place for affordable housing units -- 30 sq meters in four metros and 60 square meters for rest of the country. ""They have also made it clear that these measurements are for municipal limits, so areas like Navi Mumbai and Thane would not have Mumbai limit of 30 sq mt. The business leader said the infrastructure status to affordable housing is another major benefit that builders have been given by the government and this will help lenders too. ""This means they can take long-term funds from institutions such as insurers and pension funds. Insurance firms and pension funds need to invest certain portion of their money in infrastructure sector and the affordable housing now qualifies for those funds. ""The RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) and these new measures will also stop the practice of builders taking full money in advance from the customers and then building the project entirely on the basis of customers money. ""The tax benefit is attracting builders in a big way to affordable housing. We have seen big builders in big cities approaching us that they want to get into affordable housing. We are supporting the builders for getting into affordable housing,"" he said. Talking about other steps that would give a big fillip to the sector, he said the housing loan interest subsidy scheme is a game changer that gives subsidy of up to 6.5 per cent. The scheme was initially launched for EWS/LIG but now has been modified and extended to MIG also which is a very good step. ""There are 3-4 other things which the government has done. Holding of property is down to 2 years to qualify as a long term capital asset,"" he said. On other good provisions, Parekh said when a builder earlier had unsold flats in a completed project, the notional rent was taxed on these unsold flats from the year in which the project was completed. Now, notional rent of properties will be taken as nil for one year from the date of obtaining completion certificate.",general,3795,58,70

Indo-American Founder of health startup becomes billionaire,"Indian-American Rishi Shah, who quit college 10 years back to pursue entrepreneurial dreams, has become tech's newest billionaire. And his business partner, Shradha Agarwal, is close behind. Their windfall came with a USD 600 million infusion of venture capital into Outcome Health, the Chicago health care tech company they founded in 2006. It's now valued at USD 5.6 billion. Shah grew up in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, the son of a doctor who emigrated from India. His mother managed his father's medical practice. The initial idea for a company providing content to doctor's offices was inspired, Shah says in an interview to local media, by his sister. ""My sister has type 1 diabetes,"" Shah says. ""If she gets on an insulin pump and she is able to achieve better blood sugar control and she is checking her blood sugar more effectively, the device manufacturer wins, the insulin manufacturer wins, the blood glucometer wins, the doctor wins, but the payer wins most of all. And she wins personally."" CONTEXT MEDIA FOUND IN 2008He attended North-western University as a transfer student, where he met a woman named Shradha Agarwal, now Outcome's president. Originally working on a campus magazine, they eventually found a company called Context Media, out of North-western in 2008, funding it by taking loans that have over the years reached a combined USD 325 million instead of giving up equity. Knocking on doctor's office doors around the Chicago area, the two found little appetite for their idea. Some doctors didn't see the value in digital education in their offices; others who did want to see revenue to feel comfortable committing to such a fledgling product. Without signing them, however, the entrepreneurs had no revenue with which to placate them. They eked out $1 million in revenue that first year. ""Then we were off to the races,"" says Shah, doubling most years since. ""We had to build a profitable business, or at least a break-even business, from scratch,"" says Shah. ""We had no margin of error."" Outcome Health is not only the newest unicorn company, having earned the honor just last week, but it is also already valued in the top 30 on the list of roughly 200 non-public companies worth $1 billion. THE GROWTH OF CONTEXT MEDIACEO Rishi Shah, 31 and president Shradha Agarwal found Context Media in 2006 while the two were at North-western University. The company began to sell its video monitor services to physicians and hospitals without any outside investment. Over the next decade, the company grew and big-time investors noticed, but Shah and Agarwal passed up offers in order to scale organically and retain ownership. In January, the company changed its name to Outcome Health as it slowly pushed towards its first major round of funding. According to Crain's, the company took in more than $130 million in revenue last year and posted an operating profit margin of roughly 40%. Outcome Health doubled its revenue in each of the last two years, and it also grew with its acquisition of Accent Health last November. WHAT THE COMPANY DOES TODAYToday, Outcome Health helps both patients and doctors by providing touch screen monitors to hospitals and health care offices around the country. The company installs large, interactive video boards that allow physicians to better explain a patient's current health care needs or problems through the use of video, graphics and interactive visual aids. Outcome Health also utilises specialised software to assist physicians and patients for everything from treatment decisions to medical warning signs. Outcome tries to maximise how both doctors and patients spend their time, which helps unclog those stereotypically crowded waiting rooms. According to one of the company's online testimonials, Neil Baum, a New Orleans-based urologist, cut the time it takes him to explain a common urological procedure from 12 minutes to less than five minutes through the use of Outcome Health's Digital Anatomy Board. Outcome Health often provides its services to medical providers for free. The company makes most of its money from insurance providers, drug makers, health care marketers and pharmaceutical companies.Also Read:The story of Nagaland cop who turned Kerala billionaire",general,4252,59,70

Delhi govt to make fresh appointment for guest teachers,"The Delhi government will invite fresh applications for guest teaching positions in its school and will appoint teachers based on merit.The government?s move is a change of stance as it had earlier allowed the already employed guest teachers to continue in the last two years.The move comes two days after a group of guest teachers protested against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at a government function. The function was organised to announce measures taken by the government for the benefit of guest teachers, that included 40-90% hike in their salaries.?The government is doing so much for the guest teachers and yet the teachers are playing politics. They did ?chakka jam? outside the venue. This move will send a signal to teachers that this kind of politics will not be tolerated,? sources said.The government will invite applications in March 2017 for the next academic session. ?Principals? feedback will also be taken while hiring the teachers,? said sources.After it came to power in 2015, the government ordered continuation of existing teachers, who were engaged in 2014, and the same teachers have been teaching in schools till now.?Earlier, guest teachers were employed for 10 months every year. They had to apply afresh the next year. The government stopped that system and allowed them to continue. But a small group of politically motivated guest teachers are holding these protests,? sources said.Recently, the CM had announced that around 16,000 guest teachers will now get an increased fixed monthly salary instead of daily wages.He said that teachers who have cleared the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) will receive a 90% hike while those who have not will receive a 44% hike. Out of the 15,678 teachers teaching in over 1,100 government schools, 12,048 teachers have cleared the CTET.At present guest teachers get daily wages in the range of Rs 700-900 per day and have no weekly offs. Assistant primary teachers will now get a monthly salary of R 32,200, TGT teachers will get R 33,120 and PGT teachers will get R 34,100.The file has been sent to Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung for his approval.Sources said the government is also contemplating to hire around 9,500 teachers through Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB).",politics,2270,55,70
Israel removes metal detectors from Jerusalem holy site,"Israel is removing metal detectors from entrances to the compound that houses al-Aqsa mosque.The move was announced late on Monday night by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is designed to end a crisis over the holy site. Days of violent confrontations have claimed seven lives.Despite the Israeli announcement, however, a senior Muslim cleric in Jerusalem said worshippers should stay away from the shrine pending a review of the new Israeli security arrangements there.Ikrema Sabri, the head of the Supreme Islamic Committee in the city, said such a review may be completed later on Tuesday. Sabri said: ?Our position is that for now, nobody should enter? the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had ?accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (?smart checks?) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount?.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would ?reinforce? their presence around the holy site. It did not say when the metal detectors would be removed or what would replace them. Israeli media earlier reported that high-resolution cameras capable of detecting hidden objects would be the alternative.Earlier on Monday the UN?s Middle East envoy warned of the dangers of allowing the crisis to continue. ?It is extremely important that a solution to the current crisis be found by Friday this week,? Nickolay Mladenov said after briefing the UN security council. ?The dangers on the ground will escalate if we go through another cycle of Friday prayer without a resolution.? He said events in east Jerusalem were not ?localised? but ?affect millions if not billions of people around the world?.Even before the Israeli decision to remove the devices, it was unclear whether such a move would be sufficient to end the violence. Muslim religious officials ? who allege Israel is trying to expand its control at the site ? said they would accept only a return to the arrangements for access to the compound that had been in place before an incident on 14 Julywhen two Israeli policemen were shot by three Israeli Arab gunmen who had smuggled weapons on to the site.?This movement is a movement of the street,? said Sheikh Raed Dana of the waqf, the Islamic endowments organisation that administers the mosque compound, commenting on whether he believed worshippers should end protests and return to the shrine. ?We as the waqf listen to the street. The street says yes and we say yes; if the street says no to the measures, we will say no.?There has been increasing criticism of the way the metal detectors were installed, without consultation with the waqf and reportedly over the objections of senior Israeli security officials who had warned of the risk of bloodshed.On Monday night Israeli diplomats were evacuated from the embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, after Sunday?s shooting of two Jordanians by a security guard.The diplomats, including Israel?s ambassador to Jordan, Einat Schlain, crossed the Allenby bridge border in a convoy, arriving back in Israel at around 11pm. Among those repatriated were the security guard whom Jordan had originally said it wanted to retain for questioning over the incident.A Jordanian news site linked to the kingdom?s military said investigators had determined that the altercation at the embassy compound was not politically motivated and that one of the Jordanians, a 17-year-old, had attacked the guard with a screwdriver in a dispute about a furniture delivery.Under an agreement negotiated by the head of Israel?s domestic security service, who had been sent to Amman to negotiate, Israel agreed that Jordanian police could hear the guard?s description of the incident in the presence of Israeli diplomats.Netanyahu?s office said the return of the diplomats had been made possible ?thanks to close cooperation which was held in the past day between Israel and Jordan?.",world,4348,55,70

China warns Botswana over Dalai Lama visit,"China on Wednesday fumed over the Dalai Lama?s planned visit to Botswana, warning the African country not to ?harm? Beijing?s ?core interest?.Beijing opposes countries keeping contact or hosting the Tibetan spiritual leader, who it calls ?a wolf in sheep?s clothing? and accuses him of secessionist activities in Tibet.?China has stated its position clearly on the Dalai Lama?s visit to the relevant countries,? Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said. ?We require relevant countries to earnestly respect China?s core interests. China will not interfere in other countries internal affairs. We will not accept other countries to do things that will harm the core interests of China.?The Dalai Lama will attend a three-day human rights conference at Gaborone in Botswana from August 17.China is Africa?s largest trade partner. China?s state-run companies have the contract of building key infrastructure projects in Botswana.In 1959, after a failed uprising in Tibet, the Dalai Lama fled to India and has lived in self-imposed exile since then.China uses various tactics to settle scores if any country invites him.In the case of neighbouring Mongolia, it imposed a kind of economic blockade, crippling the economy of the poor country.Following his April visit to Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing claims as its own, Beijing had retaliated by changing the name of six cities in the northeastern Indian state.",world,1409,42,70

Phone screen coating to let people read in bright light made,"Washington, Jun 23 (PTI) Inspired by the nanostructures found on moth eyes, scientists have developed a new anti- reflection film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. The film exhibits a surface reflection of just 0.23 per cent, much lower than the iPhones surface reflection of 4.4 per cent, for example. Reflection is the major reason it is difficult to read a phone screen in bright sunlight, as the strong light reflecting off the screens surface washes out the display. ""Using our flexible anti-reflection film on smartphones and tablets will make the screen bright and sharp, even when viewed outside,"" said Shin-Tson Wu from the University of Central Florida in the US. ""In addition to exhibiting low reflection, our nature- inspired film is also scratch resistant and self-cleaning, which would protect touch screens from dust and fingerprints,"" said Wu, who led the study published in the journal Optica. The new film contains tiny uniform dimples, each about 100 nanometres in diameter (about one-thousandth of the width of a human hair). The coating can also be used with flexible display applications such as phones with screens that fold like a book, which are expected to hit the market as soon as next year. Many of todays smartphones use a sensor to detect bright ambient light and then boost the screens brightness level enough to overcome the strong surface reflection. Although this type of adaptive brightness control can help improve readability, it also drains battery power. Other methods for solving the sunlight visibility problem have proved difficult to implement. Looking for a simpler approach to improve screen readability outside, the researchers turned to nature. The eyes of moths are covered with a pattern of antireflective nanostructures that allow moths to see in the dark and prevent eye reflections that might be seen by predators. The researchers developed a fabrication technique that uses self-assembled nanospheres to form a precise template that can be used to create the moth-eye-like structure on a coating.",general,2109,60,70
32-title-winning Tennis champ throws away his trophies,"Andy Roddick may have been the most decorated American men?s tennis player of his generation, but good luck finding the silverware to show for it.Roddick?s wife, Brooklyn Decker, said the former world No1 decided to throw away nearly all of his trophies during a recent cleaning spree at the couple?s home in Austin, Texas.?We have his US Open trophy,? Decker told People magazine in an interview published on Wednesday. ?But all his other trophies Andy threw away in the garbage.?Roddick was 21 when he shot to stardom with his breakthrough win at Flushing Meadows in 2003 ? still the last major singles title won by an American man ? and finished that season atop the ATP rankings. His abrupt retirement during the 2012 US Open left the United States without an active men?s grand slam champion for the first time in 129 years, since the inception of what then was called the US National Championships.While Roddick never managed to win a second grand slam championship despite reaching four more finals (and losing to Roger Federer in each of them), the outspoken Texan won 32 titles and spent nearly a decade in the top 10 during a 12-year professional career that will see him inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this month.?It was really upsetting,? Decker said of Roddick?s shock decluttering. ?He did it one day when I was out of town. [He] decided that these don?t mean success to me, these don?t define me and I don?t really care to have these material things sitting around the house, so he threw them in the trash.

HC summons WCD Secretary after 42 kids flee remand home,"Days after Maharashtra Women and Child Development Minister Pankaja Munde told the state Assembly that 42 children went missin in the last three years from a remand home in Mumbai, the Bombay High Court today summoned department's secretary to appear in person.The high court today came down heavily on the Maharashtra government after an affidavit was filed by Women and Child Development Secretary Vineeta Singhal in a case of corruption in the Dongri Children's Home of Mumbai. The affidavit does not mention anything about the action that the government has taken against accused persons in the Dongri Children's Home case. The high court has directed Vineeta Singhal to appear in person next week to explain government's stand in the case.A sting operation had shown corruption in the Mumbai Children's Home. The division bench of justice R M Savant and Justice Sadhna Jadhav noted that ""from reading the affidavit, we gather that it has only been filed to comply with our orders. We expected some pro-active action from state government.""PIL AND THE CASE A letter had been sent by a former chief justice of Kolkata High Court who had spoken about the disturbing sting after which it was converted into a petition by the Bombay High Court. The bench had sent a notice to the government, which filed its response today.As many as 42 juveniles had fled the Dongri remand home located in the city in the last three years. The matter was raised in the Maharashtra Assembly. There were also reports that juveniles were being kept in the children's home in violation of norms.In a written response to a question by Pravin Darekar (BJP), Pankaja Munde said that from 2014-15 to 2016-17, 42 children had fled the Dongri remand home. Out of those, 16 were traced and brought back and one security official was suspended.GOVERNMENT'S REPLY IN COURTThe Bombay High Court sought to know if any action had been taken by the state government against those who were shown indulging in malpractice. The affidavit only mentioned that a show cause notice was sent to one person while the guard of the children's home was suspended. When public prosecutor Arajakta Shinde told the court that an inquiry was going on, Justice Savant asked, ""What kind of inquiry happens we all know. Assurance is not going to help.""Justice Jadhav said, ""We are not satisfied with the manner in which this affidavit has been filed. We expect some seriousness. Therefore, we directed the secretary to file the affidavit."" The bench was furious with the government's response. The court said that it was not a matter of only suspicion as a CD of the corruption and other materials had already come out in public domain. A process of cleansing should have started by now, the bench said.The Bombay High Court directed the Women and Child Development Secretary to be appear in person before the court in the next hearing next week.ALSO READ | Mumbai teen kills self, could be first Indian case of Blue Whale suicide challenge",general,2989,55,70
Karnataka High Court calls demonetisation laudable,"New Delhi, Dec 8 (PTI) Dismissing the petition against demonetisation, Karnataka High Court has upheld certain restrictions that accompanied the decision saying they are matters for central government and RBI to decide. In his order, Justice Ashok B Hinchigeri observed that ""laudable objectives"" to tackle the menaces of fake currency notes, black money and terrorism cannot be achieved without imposing restrictions. ""...but in a situation of this nature, no directions, much less time-bound directions, can be given to the government of India and the RBI,"" he said. The order was issued by the Karnataka High Court in a writ petition seeking removal of cap on withdrawal imposed by government and RBI following demonetisation of Rs 500/1000 currency notes effective November 9. ""In the larger interests of the society, when a comprehensive mission is being accomplished, certain regulatory measures during the period of transition are bound to affect the interests of some sections of people,"" the order said. ""There cannot be any dispute that the collateral damage, if any on any section is to be minimised, if it cannot be avoided. What steps are to be taken, are the matters for the central government and RBI to decide,"" it added. Observing that the menaces of black money, fake currency and terrorism are ""hydra-headed monsters"", the order said, ""when one head of the monster is chopped off, it would raise its other ugly heads. Stamping them out is indeed a herculean task."" The order dated December 6 also noted that it is impossible for any policy maker to anticipate all the difficulties and contingencies. ""As and when the difficulties are noticed in the course of implementing the policy, the necessary remedial measures have to be taken,"" it said.

Six children move NGT over pollution in Delhi,"Harsh Dahiya, 14, a resident of Swarn Park in Mundka, looks like an average Class IX student. There?s a difference though. This student of NC Jindal Public School is a petitioner in a court case demanding clean air in his toxic corner of Delhi.He and five other children have moved the National Green Tribunal, which has sent notices to the Centre and the Delhi government on the alarming levels of air pollution caused by industries in West Delhi.This is the second instance in recent times when little ones have petitioned against the foul air of the city in a court of law. In 2015, three parents had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of their toddlers, calling for a ban on bursting of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR.

"India is the guru, Tibetans are disciples: Dalai Lama","The 14th Dalai Lama calls India a 'guru' and Tibet a 'chela' (disciple) but then there are moments when a 'chela' cries on meeting his guru.

Thupten Rinpoche was in tears as he read out the welcome speech for Dalai Lama. In a moment, his throat choked and he stopped reading, and started crying inconsolably. Within minutes, half of the gathering was in tears as they saw Dalai Lama in the prayer hall.

"Taapsee Pannu, Amit Sadh's Running Shaadi hits the theatres","Running Shaadi is the story of a bunch of small town entrepreneurs who start a website to help couples elope and marry. Here is our Running Shaadi movie review.Running Shaadi Cast: Amit Sadh, Taapsee Pannu, Arsh BajwaRunning Shaadi Direction: Amit RoyRunning Shaadi Rating: (3/5)Running Shaadi, previously known as Runningshaadi.com but not anymore because Shaadi.com approached Bombay High Court protesting against the title, is a film that is great in patches but is mostly just about okay.The story of Running Shaadi involves Ram Bharose (Amit Sadh) and Nimmi (Taapsee Pannu), a boy and girl who grow up together in Punjab and after a fallout with his boss, Ram joins hands with his friend 'Cyberjeet' (the excellent Arsh Bajwa) to start a website called Runningshaadi.com that organises all that an everyday eloping couple from India would need. Nimmi joins the duo but soon enough, the romantic tension between her and Ram takes the story through unexpected turns.MOVIE REVIEW: THE GHAZI ATTACKWatch Running Shaadi trailer here:Running Shaadi was ready two years ago, but the distributors could never find a suitable window to release it. That is unfortunate because within those two years, films like Dolly Ki Doli and Happy Bhag Jayegi released. As such, conceptually, the film seems dated. While watching the film, you would get shades of Band Baaja Baaraat (two unlikely small-towners getting together to become entrepreneurs), and of course, the aforementioned films because there's the entire 'runaway bride' angle.Nevertheless, there is a lot that works for Running Shaadi. And that 'lot' is pretty much the excellent casting.Amit Sadh as the ambitious and resourceful Ram Bharose gives a career-defining performance as the lead. He is what they call 'lambi race ka ghoda.' Amit gets to showcase a range of emotions in Running Shaadi and he never, ever falters. He is so good. Hopefully, he gets noticed in Running Shaadi for all his worth.Then, there's Arsh Bajwa as the goofy but smart tech geek Sarabjeet AKA Cyberjeet. The scenes of him worshipping Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and that funny-for-a-while red turban with the image of a Facebook 'Like' button on it seem forced but that does not take away from Arsh's grade-A supporting act.Taapsee Pannu gets a very tricky, complicated character, Nimmi. Nimmi is the kind of girl who you will never want to make a team-member if you have to rob a bank. She cons Ram Bharose in the most unexpected manner right before the interval and one will be hard-pressed to sympathise or empathise with her. However, Ram, who has been established as a 'sorted' dude, for some reason, continues to willingly jump into near-fatal situations for her. Is love a good enough reason to justify unconvincing character development?Watch 'Mannerless Majnu' from Running Shaadi:Three entire paragraphs are devoted to the film's actors because that is how much they hold the story together. Because without them, the plot falls apart. Running Shaadi is made of an err...running chain of unbelievable plot twists but we will suspend our disbelief simply because of the strength of its actors.Debutant director Amit Roy, who has previously been a cinematographer for Ram Gopal Varma's very uniquely-shot movies such as the Sarkar films, Nishabd and Rann, has the potential to make a great second film. Running Shaadi on paper seems trite, but it is consistently engaging because newer and wilder plot developments get thrown at you (Roy is also the writer) and you cannot help but continue to run with its characters to find out what eventually becomes of them.In a week packed with multiple Bollywood and Hollywood releases, will Running Shaadi get noticed, more so, by the right people? An extra star for Amit, Taapse and Arsh.(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)",entertainment,3809,59,70

BMW denies reports of emissions manipulations,"German carmaker BMW on Sunday rejected media reports that the emissions treatment systems in its vehicles do not work effectively and that it colluded with rivals on their design.Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday that BMW, VW (VOWG_p.DE), Audi and Porsche may have colluded to fix the prices and designs of diesel emissions treatment systems and other vehicle parts.""Cars of the BMW Group are not being manipulated and are in line with the applicable legal requirements,"" BMW said in a statement.The European Commission said on Saturday that EU antitrust regulators were investigating the allegations and German politicians have called for transparency and punishment in the event of wrongdoing.Vehicle emissions have come under closer scrutiny worldwide since Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to installing illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests on diesel cars.BMW said it rejected accusations its diesel cars with Euro 6 engines do not provide adequate exhaust treatment because the AdBlue tanks - that inject urea solution as part of the process - are too small.It said its technology combined AdBlue tanks with catalytic converters to lower harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations, fulfilling all requirements and meaning that no vehicle recalls or software upgrades for Euro 6 engines were necessary.Euro 6 is the latest emissions standard set by European regulators which came into force a few years ago.BMW also said talks with other manufacturers about AdBlue tanks had been aimed at creating an infrastructure for operating them across Europe.The company reiterated it was committed to carrying out voluntary, free-of-charge software updates of older diesel passenger cars with Euro 5 engines.A spokesman for BMW said he could not comment on details of the EU probe.",general,1798,45,70
"How can you make Aadhaar mandatory, SC asks Centre","The Supreme Court today came down hard on the government over the issue of making Aadhaar compulsory in complete violation of the apex court's previous order.""How can you make Aadhaar mandatory despite a clear order to make it optional. Is making Aadhaar by force the only way to tackle fraud?"" a furious Supreme Court told the Centre while hearing a PIL against the government's decision making Aadhaar compulsory. The Supreme Court bench led by Justice Sikri questioned the Centre as to how Aadhar can be made compulsory and forced on people. The Centre's argument has been that the earlier order merely applies for beneficiary schemes like LPG and food grains and the government is free to use it for other services like income tax.GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSEThe contention here is of reading the earlier order. While the Centre is making case for a narrow reading of the order restricting it to essential services and beneficiary schemes, the petitioners have given the earlier order a broad reading. The main matter in Aadhaar is pending on the question of the right to privacy. ""We found a number of of Pan cards being used to divert funds to shell companies. To prevent this, the only option is to make Aadhaar card mandatory,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court bench.WHAT SUPREME COURT RULING SAYSThe Supreme Court had on March 27 made it clear that Aadhaar cards cannot be made mandatory by the government for extending benefits of social welfare schemes.The top court, however, said that the government cannot be barred from seeking these cards, which are issued by UIDAI, for ""non-benefit"" purposes like filing of IT returns and opening of accounts""The answer is this that for giving benefits of welfare schemes, it (Aadhaar) cannot be pressed. They (government and its agencies) cannot be stopped from seeking Aadhaar for non-benefit schemes like opening of bank accounts,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar had said. The apex court on August 11, 2015 had said that Aadhaar cards will not be mandatory for availing benefits of government's welfare schemes and barred the authorities from sharing personal biometric data collected for enrollment under the schemeHowever, on October 15, 2015 it had lifted its earlier restriction and permitted the voluntary use of Aadhaar cards in welfare schemes that also included MGNREGA, all pension schemes and the provident fund besides ambitious flagship programmes like 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna' of the NDA government.(With PTI inputs) ALSO READ:Aadhaar card can't be made mandatory by government for welfare schemes: Supreme Court",politics,2613,50,70

"UK boss gives staff castle office with ice cave, ski lodge","London, Jan 19 (PTI) The head of a website has been dubbed Britains best boss after he splurged a whopping three million pounds to create a dream castle office for his employees complete with a Star Wars-themed cinema, gaming arcade, yoga studio along with an ""ice cave"" for meetings. Chris Morling, founder of Money.co.uk, spent 3 million pounds on renovation of his office with impressive designing by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Morling envisioned this style of workplace to keep his 50-strong staff ""entertained and engaged"" and to help attract the creme de la creme of the industry, The Sun reported. The spectacular building stands on the Bathurst Estate in Cirencester, East Gloucestershire. Based in a Victorian castle on the Bathurst Estate, other on-site luxuries include a weights gym, yoga studio and staff also enjoy free weekly sport matches -- which the boss himself gets involved in. Knowing it would be a tall order to convince future employees to work outside of the capital, Morling knew he had to offer them some unusual perks. And what better way to spice up a boring meeting than having it in an ice cave and ski lodge -- or a perfectly stylish library. Even the bathrooms are designed with Rolling Stones and Steam Punk influences to make going to the toilet as exciting as it possibly can be.

The first option is that the Centre gives Rs2,000 crore for land acquisition. The second is that UP and the Centre share 50% each of the Rs2,000 crore amount. The third option is that the YEIDA and the Airports Authority of India sign a memorandum of understanding to raise Rs200 crore, and raise the remaining Rs1,800 crore through loans,? said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, YEIDA.The YEIDA is facing a fund crunch as it owes Rs3,000 crore to various government bodies and banks.

Ban may push dancers into prostitution: Bar Union to SC,"Maharashtra's bar dancers have waltzed up to the Supreme Court and argued that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push them into activities like prostitution.Members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union knocked on the SC's door on Monday against the ""unjust and arbitrary"" new restrictions such as curbs on body movement, ban on acceptance of tips and showering of money as well as serving of liquor in performing area apart from mandatory installation of CCTV cameras.They reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 left over 75,000 female workers unemployed. They brought to the apex court's attention the observation of another bench that struck down a similar state law. The plea will be heard on March 2. The Maharashtra government had over a decade ago suspended the licences of bars and hotels where young women were employed to dance to racy film songs for male customers, claiming they were a bad influence on society.But the top court said last year that bars could once again apply for licences.SUPREME COURT'S JUDGMENTThe SC had in an earlier judgment said, ""It has been brought on the record that many of them (bar dancers) have been compelled to take up prostitution out of necessity for maintenance of their families. In our opinion, the impugned legislation has proved to be totally counterproductive and cannot be sustained.""This is the first time that bar dancers themselves have come forward to oppose the Maharashtra law.Till now the challenge was only from hotel, restaurant and dance bar owners. The fresh plea has termed the new Act as ""arbitrary"" and ""violative"" of their right to earn a livelihood through legitimate means. The union alleges that the term ""obscene dance"" in the Act has been deliberately kept vague to allow police to harass performers.The SC had earlier slammed the Maharashtra Police on the matter. The apex court summoned and reminded the Mumbai DCP (licensing) that it was better for women to perform in dance bars than indulge in ""unacceptable activities"".""You have to change your mindset,"" Justice Dipak Misra had said.

"Company makes ?17,000 gadget to tell users if they smell bad","Worried your body odour is out of control but suspect your colleagues are too polite to say anything about it? Now there?s an app for that, too.A Japanese tech company has begun selling a device that allows people to self-test their sweaty exteriors for three categories of smell.The pocket-sized detector, which looks like a tape recorder, connects by Bluetooth to a smartphone app that divulges the potentially ominous results in a suitably discreet manner.Konica Minolta, the firm previously best known for producing cameras and printers, believes there is a market for the odour checker in Japan because people are ?particularly sensitive to smell?.There is even a word in Japanese for the behaviour of office workers who annoy others with their noxious aromas ? sumehara, or ?smell harassment?.At a launch event in Tokyo on Thursday, this reporter discovered the inevitable consequences of walking 30 minutes in the searing summer sun to get to the venue.A check behind the ear revealed fairly high readings of sweat smells and middle-fat odours. ?Immediately care is needed,? the app warned in a message on the results page.There was, however, nothing detected in the category kareish? ? which translates as old-age smell, commonly associated with the substance 2-nonenal.Daisuke Koda, who is the incubation lead at Konica Minolta Japan?s business innovation centre, said the idea arose after a discussion he had with several male colleagues, all aged about 40, two years ago.They were discussing the increasingly intense summer heat and confided in each other that they sometimes were afraid of how they smelled.?We looked for a device to measure body smell, only to find that there was no device at all to tell the different types of smells,? Koda told the Guardian.?That prompted us to think it might be an opportunity for a new business and we continued our research further deeper.?Studies showed that the number one etiquette concern in the workplace was body smell, Koda added. At the same time, people found it difficult to speak out about another colleague?s odours.?We see challenges that these people are aware of but nobody has a solution for,? he said.The resulting device is called Kunkun Body, which takes its name from the Japanese word for sniff. It can be used to test for smells in four locations: near the head, behind the ear, under the armpit and around the feet.The device is available to Japanese buyers as part of a set of care products in a crowdfunding drive launched on Thursday morning. Early adopters are offered discounts on the recommended retail price of 30,000 yen (US$265 or £206) with the devices set to be delivered later this year.The company said it had no current plans to sell the device outside Japan.It?s not the first device aimed at addressing smell-related worries in Japan. Last year, Sony released a portable aroma diffuser called Aromastic. Owners of the device, dubbed an ?aromatic Walkman?, can select which scent they want to be emitted in their vicinity.In a bid to beat the notoriously hot and humid summer conditions, people in Japan often carry around handkerchiefs to wipe away sweat and parasols to block the sun?s rays.In June last year, retailers and manufacturers reported an increase in sales of antiperspirants and wipe products compared to the previous year, according to a report by Jiji Press.",technology,3365,60,70

Apart from the three hospitals, the government will also remodel 11 of its biggest hospitals to add these 10,000 beds.The minister also said that latest technology would be used to make the new three hospitals among the best. ?The hospital in Dwarka will be state-of-the-art with solar panels and natural sewage treatment plant,? the minister said.The Dwarka hospital building has also used a base isolation system to protect it from earthquakes. In this kind of structures, there is a fixed base on the ground and the building is separated from it using flexible bearings.?So, in case of an earthquake, the tremors are absorbed by the bearings and the main building does not move much. This is a good thing because it is extremely difficult to evacuate patients from a hospital in the incident of earthquakes,? said an official working on the project.?The patients will likely not even feel anything if there is an earthquake. This is maybe the first government hospital in India to use such a technology,? Jain said.",health,1811,56,70
Mamata Banerjee plans to gift cows to farmers in West Bengal,"In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is all set to commandeer the saffron monopoly over cows and their protection. Bent on proving that cows cannot be tethered to gaushalas of a particular political hue, the chief minister has decided to gift cows to poor farmers in her state.The objective, officials associated with the initiative say, is to help small and marginal farming families supplement their incomes by selling milk and using dung to produce eco-friendly fuel and manure for organic farming. ""This will not only ensure better living conditions for the cattle population, but will generate alternative employment opportunities for farmers, especially in the unfortunate event of crop failure,"" said an agriculture department officer.Farmers in North 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts will receive the first batches of the gift cows. And going one better than the National Gokul Mission, where the Centre and state share the cost of the animals given to farmers, Mamata's government will fully fund the state's 'Godaan' scheme. That's not all. A most vocal critic of the Modi government proposal to introduce Aadhaar-like tags for cows, Mamata's government is now working on assigning UIDs (unique identification numbers) to the state's bovine population (this was apparently decided following a cow census in 2014).Paschimbanga go sampad bikash sangstha, a state body under the animal resources development department, has hired 5,174 praanimitras (friends of animals) to tag the cows. Some 1.38 million cows have already been assigned UIDs.",general,1545,60,70
Arjun to replace Akshay in Namastey London sequel: Report,"The fantastic box-office run of Namastey London prompted director Vipul Shah to announce a sequel to his 2007 hit - Namastey England. From the leading lady to the story, Namastey England has been the subject of speculation for a while now. Now, according to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Arjun Kapoor is replacing Akshay Kumar in the sequel.There were rumours of Akshay being unhappy with the script, but the actor had told PTI last year that the script was still being written. Apparently, Akshay is happy with the choice of replacement for him.A source told the publication that Arjun is a fan of the original film, and loved the script of its sequel. ""Arjun was keen because the franchise provides a unique perspective on how Indians are looked at internationally and vice versa. But he wanted to make sure that Akshay had no problems about the franchise moving forward without him, before signing on the dotted line. Last month, Akshay and Vipul who have been close friends and have collaborated on a dozen films over the last two decades, mutually agreed to go ahead with Arjun. The film will roll early 2018 and like the original, will be shot in Punjab and the UK,"" the insider said.Talking about the similarities with Namastey London, the source added, ""The second film too has been scripted in a manner to appeal to expats and has a Punjabi and Brit flavour."" Just like Katrina Kaif had a significant role to play in the original, the leading lady of Namastey England will have a meaty role too. ""She's an ambitious Punjabi, who's fascinated by the glitz and glamour and wants to move to UK while Arjun's character, a mischievous desi Romeo, is rooted in his land and culture like the original Arjun Singh. His character will be quite quirky this time around,"" the source revealed.",general,1787,57,70
No compromise possible: China on border standoff with India,"compromise By Priyanka Tikoo New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) China today ruled out a compromise in the military standoff with India in the Sikkim section, and put the onus on New Delhi to resolve the ""grave"" situation. In unusually blunt remarks, Chinas Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said ""the ball is in Indias court"" and it was for the Indian government to decide what options could be on the table to resolve the standoff. Asked about remarks by official Chinese media and think- tanks that the conflict can lead to a ""war"" if not handled properly, the ambassador said in an interview to PTI: ""There has been talk about this option, that option. It is up to your government policy (whether to exercise military option)."" The Chinese government is very clear that it wants peaceful resolution at current state of the situation for which withdrawal of Indian troops from the area is a ""pre- condition"", he asserted. ""The first priority is that the Indian troops unconditionally pull back to the Indian side of the boundary. That is the precondition for any meaningful dialogue between China and India,"" he said. China and India have been engaged in a standoff in the Dokalam area near the Bhutan trijunction for past 19 days after a Chinese armys construction party came to build a road. Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognises as Dokalam, while China claims it as part of its Donglang region. China and Bhutan are engaged in talks over the resolution of the area. Bhutan, however, has no diplomatic ties with China and it is supported militarily and diplomatically by India. ""The situation is grave and made me deeply worried. It is the first time that Indian troops have crossed the mutually recognised boundary and trespassed into Chinas territory, triggering a close range face off between Chinese and Indian border troops. Now 19 days have passed, but the situation still has not eased,"" Luo said. He also asserted that India has no right to interfere with the China-Bhutan boundary talks, nor is it entitled to make territorial claims on behalf of Bhutan. On the standoff, the Ministry of External Affairs had said India was ""deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and has conveyed to the Chinese government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India"".",general,2363,59,70
Kejriwal clarifies his 'Delhi to be made London' remark,"New Delhi, Mar 6 (PTI) Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said Delhi will be made as clean as London keeping its unique cultural ethos intact, seeking to clarify his earlier remarks which have been mocked by the Opposition. Kejriwal said that his Aam Aadmi Party would clean up the capital within one year of coming to power in the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs). ""I want to clarify that I have not said that we will turn Delhi into London. Delhi has its own culture and its heart... Delhis people are very good. ""When we go to western countries including London, we see a high level of cleanliness there. Delhi will be made as clean as London, which only the AAP can do,"" he told reporters. While addressing a gathering yesterday, Kejriwal had said that if the AAP won the MCD polls, it would spruce up Delhi and make it look like London within a year. The Delhi chief minister also slammed the BJP and the Congress, saying that both the parties which have been controlling the MCDs for 20 years have failed to clean up the city. ""The BJP and the Congress have been ruling municipal corporations for 20 years and they have destroyed MCDs (financially). It is the first responsibility of MCDs to clean up Delhi. ""It is only the AAP which can clean up Delhi as people know that we have done unprecedented works in education, water, power and health,"" the Delhi chief minister said. Over his Londons remark, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari hit out at Kejriwal, saying ""he should first make Delhi a better Delhi before planning to make it London.""",general,1562,55,70

Noting that the US has placed the details of Major Defense Partner designation for Senate approval as part of FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the party said the Narendra Modi government ""has not even made a statement in Parliament about such a significant deal."" ""The country can see the US side of the deal by reading the 2017 NDAA, but remains ignorant of the Indian commitment as a Major Defense Partner of the United States,"" CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said. In a letter to the Prime Minister, he referred to Paragraph (E) of Section 1292 of 2017 NDAA, ""which talks of mechanisms to verify the security of defense articles, defense services, and related technology, such as appropriate cyber security and end user monitoring agreements for items and technologies sold to India. ""Paragraph (F) thereafter states that India will align its export control and procurement regimes with those of the United States."" Yechury further said, ""Paragraph(I) of Section 1292, 2017 NDAA makes the facts amply clear. It explicitly highlights enhanced defense and security cooperation with India in order to advance United States interests in South Asia and greater Indo-Asia-Pacific regions."" ""This is, sadly, a commitment by your government to become a junior ally of the US in our own neighbourhood. This represents the final nail in the coffin of Indias independent foreign policy,"" Yechury said in his letter to Modi.",general,1701,60,70
Delhi airport staff fails to detect 'bomb' in security drill,"A bag with a ?bomb? has gone undetected through Delhi airport security checks. Luckily, it was only part of a drill to check arrangements at the airport ? a test that the CISF personnel flunked.

In a drill conducted in April, CISF officials failed in the security drill. Parts of an improvised explosive device were put in a hand bag without a detonator, and civil aviation officials made an easy entry to the Delhi airport with it. Security checks conducted on hand baggage for an Air India flight to Jammu also failed to detect the explosive.It was only then that the CISF, which is responsible for airport security, was informed that it had failed the test.

Mayweather to fight McGregor only if paid ?680 crore,"Floyd Mayweather has said he will come out of retirement to fight Conor McGregor but only if he gets paid $100m (£82m) and the Irish UFC star is prepared to take a career-high $15m (£12m), plus a minor slice of the pay-per-view revenue.Meanwhile, the 38-year-old Manny Pacquiao, who had been hoping for a rematch with Mayweather, has agreed to defend his WBO welterweight title against a little-known Queensland schoolteacher, Jeff Horn, in Brisbane in April, according to unconfirmed reports in Australia. It is part of a three-fight farewell Pacquiao?s promoter, Bob Arum, is organising for the Filipino senator.It is the Mayweather-McGregor fight that would create the substantially bigger buzz, however, which says much about the state of boxing and the rise of mixed martial arts. Regardless of the fact it would be a mismatch, it still might be the richest fight in either fighting discipline in 2017.Mayweather, who turns 40 next month and retired undefeated in September 2015, has teased his fans for months with the prospect of having one more fight to surpass the 49-0 record that he currently shares with Rocky Marciano.In an exclusive interview with ESPN, the American said: ?I?m saying right here: Conor McGregor keeps telling everybody he wants the fight ? let?s make it happen.?We tried to make the fight. They know what my number is. My number was a guaranteed $100m. We?re the A-side and I don?t know how much money he has made? I?m pretty sure he hasn?t even made $10m from an MMA bout. But we are willing to give him $15m and then we can talk about splitting the percentage, the back-end percentage on pay-per view.?But of course we?re the A-side. How can a guy talk about $20m or $30m if he?s never even made $8m or $9m [for one fight]??In his penultimate appearance in May 2015, Mayweather split a record $340m purse 60/40 with Pacquiao and boosted his take to an estimated $300m with his share of the pay-per-view. However, the cachet of both champions has faded and Mayweather has little or no interest in a rematch.

The accused have been sent on three days police remand for further questioning. The machines are easily available online at a very low price, police said.A few days earlier, a similar racket was unearthed in?Delhi where an employee of Farzi cafe in Connaught Place was caught by police for cloning cards.

A must watch: Kejriwal on Vishwas' video slamming AAP,"Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described as a must-watch and something that ?shakes one deeply? a video put out by Aam Aadmi Party colleague Kumar Vishwas, who takes a swipe at the his own government over the issue of corruption.Still recovering from the humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll where the ruling party lost to the BJP and was pushed to a distant third, Kejriwal stepped in quickly to contain the damage the video could do in the run-up to the April 23 municipal elections, billed as a test of AAP?s popularity.Reflecting on the state of the nation, Vishwas talks about a host of issues -- from Pakistan, Kashmir to corruption. The video that was put on YouTube two days ago has since been shared widely on social media.All political parties and their leader should keep India first, says 47-year-old Vishwas, who is also a poet.?If you form government in Delhi on an anti-corruption plank and fall silent when some of your own come under scanner, people have the right to question you,? he says.Recently, some AAP leaders have been accused of corruption and nepotism by a panel that looked into a string of decisions taken by the Kejriwal government.The CBI is examining accusations of money laundering against Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.In his ?India first? message, Vishwas also questions the ?personality cult? and goes on to draw a parallel between Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Yogi Adityanath.?Whether it is Modi, Rahul, Yogi or Kejriwal...it is about five years, 10 years or 25 years. But India is beyond this and will be there for thousands of years,? Vishwas says, triggering talk of infighting in AAP.Kejriwal tweeted the video on Saturday, saying the video was wonderful and everyone should watch it.???? ?????? ?????? ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ????? ?????? https://t.co/0pIOm401T9? Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) April 15, 2017The chief minister then went on to retweet messages of party leaders and volunteers who had shared the video and their interpretation of it.In an interview to a TV news channel, Kejriwal said Vishwas was family and the controversy over the video message was media propaganda.?He is not only a party member. He is family...its (talks of Kumar being unhappy) media creation. Tomorrow media will say my wife has targeted me,? Kejriwal said in an interview to CNN News 18, a clip of which was also retweeted by the CM.Defending his government?s record on corruption, the chief minister said he had been ruthless and had sacked ministers, whenever credible evidence was put forward.Vishwas is one of the popular faces of AAP and is also on the list of the so-called star campaigners for the municipal elections but has so far stayed away from electioneering.",general,2754,53,70
Fraud worth ?150 cr unearthed in Noida gold jewellery unit,"The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) unearthed an alleged fraud worth Rs150 crore on Monday and arrested the owner of a Noida-based unit manufacturing gold jewellery. The unit is in Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ). Smuggled gold has been in high demand in India post demonetisation since it is being considered a safe commodity to launder black money that is mostly available in India in old high denomination notes. In the wake of demonetisation, DRI is probing the misuse of duty free gold imports into the country, says a DRI release.The purpose of the fraud allegedly committed by Mahalakshmi jewellers was to ?smuggle/divert? high priority gold imported from Dubai into the domestic Indian market by evading 10% basic customs duty.It is estimated that more than Rs150 crore worth of imported duty free bullion has been diverted into the domestic market. The mastermind is also believed to have diverted imported gold bars procured under bond from banks/nominated agencies for manufacturing jewellery, the handout read.In multiple searches conducted by DRI on the business and residential premises of the mastermind, a total of 40 kg gold valued Rs12 crore has been seized and the mastermind, who reportedly owned the unit in NSEZ, has been arrested and remanded in judicial custody. DRI, the apex customs enforcement arm of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), intercepted a live export consignment declared as gold jewellery (22 carat) exported from NSEZ at Delhi Cargo terminal. On examination, the consignment was found to contain mostly ?copper chains? with zero gold content. Another consignment of the exporter was intercepted at NSEZ factory premises ready for export to UAE. In all, out of 35 kg declared gold jewellery, about 85-90% was found to be copper alloy and other low-value metal alloys. The actual imported high purity gold was diverted to the local market, the DRI statement said.Follow up searches are being conducted by DRI officers.",general,1978,58,70

Here is the entire text of the poem: We are the mob and the mob is us.Left-wing, right-wing or in the centre, what difference does it make?Aren?t we all just looking for a fight, since we?re always right & the other fake?Not thoughts or feelings, but trending hashtags tell us where to draw daggers, and how deep.And before we hit the jugular, we are wowed by another trend, another bend, and we unflinchingly take the leap.Dog thrown from a roof, child fallen in a well,Valentine villains volley, kittens rescued from hell.Perverted politicians exposed, potholes all the way, #SelfieWithMamma is trending; smile, its mothers day.Then there?s #climatechange #harassment #feminism and #gayrights.Like bloodhounds we wait on standby, For an invisible god to ?trend? the next fight.140 character zombies, will then rise on two sides.Each will uphold an idea of ?truth? that?s either black or it is white.Their truth is ?the? truth, They have no time for nuance.Craven web-warriors will turn lynch mobs,dancing in a deathly digital trance.?Slam?, ?demolish?, ?destroy?; headlines appear to provoke outrage.Hypnotised by clever click-bait, we are programmed to spew hate.Often, a stray opinion will wander,into this curfew of manufactured truth,seeking no alliance with black nor white,and with original thought to boot.But contradictions will be silenced, and trolled with damning labels. And if it endures, persists and kicks back, Of a new hashtag it may be found able.The stray thought will then be co-opted,A following of its own it will make.And when it starts to believe its own legend,fast fingers will claw at its facade.After all, we are the mob and the mob is us.Apurva was recently in news when he got into a row with Kangana Ranaut over the writing credits of Hansal Mehta?s next starring Kangana, Simran.

Split captaincy doesn't work in India: Dhoni on resignation,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who stepped down as captain of India's limited-overs teams last week, is addressing his first press conference after relinquishing his position. CLICK HERE TO WATCH FULL VIDEODhoni will feature in the ODI series against England starting January 15. He reportedly wants to play on till the 2019 World Cup. Virat Kohli, who took over as captain, said he hoped Dhoni would play fearlessly after the shedding the burden of leadership. The 35-year-old is also expected to bat higher up the order under Kohli and could be key to India's success as they seek to defend the Champions Trophy in England later in the year.Here are the highlights from Dhoni's press conference:- I wanted to bat low because we didn't have any explosive batsmen lower down the order. Depends on the situation and I will see where to bat. - Won't grow my hair.- To the long story short - in my mind, my last series at home was vs South Africa. Split captaincy does not really work. It was always in mind when Kohli took over the Test captaincy. I wanted him to have some time and then I decided it was time to move on and give Kohli the full captaincy.- As a wicketkeeper, I will have to keep a close eye as to what the skipper really wants ""I don't believe in split captaincy. For the team there has to be only one leader"" @msdhoni#TeamIndiapic.twitter.com/vjbJilTJX0- I had a chat with Kohli to see where he wants his field. - Overall, it has been a journey for me, the ups and downs. When I started, there were a lot of senior players and we had to make sure the transition was smooth when they left.- The juniors who came in when the seniors left will take the legacy forward. It has been a journey I have really enjoyed- Kohli and I have always been very close. He was never worried when he missed out but he always wanted to contribute whenever he got a chance. Was waiting for right time,ws waiting for Virat to ease in into test format. Feel this team has the potential to win in all formats-MS Dhoni pic.twitter.com/8T17nreoRB- My job will be to assist Kohli whenever it is needed. I will tell him what I think from behind the stumps. As a wicketkeeper, I will get to see the game and see details. - The more I can serve Kohli, the better it will be for Indian cricket ""I believe this team will be the most successful Indian team under Virat's captaincy"" @msdhoni#TeamIndiapic.twitter.com/gzGAoj1I4J- - The more I can serve Kohli, the better it will be for Indian cricket- I was willing to bat lower down the order because I thought I could do it. I am ready to bat wherever the team wants me to bat - As a captain you have to be very practical- Sometimes you have to give false confidence to a player.- You may face a few problems but more often than not, you look at the bigger picture. You have to see who can win big games for you - Always thought there were too many press conferences. You need fresh views from a player. One press conference after the match is enough- The skipper is best placed to go. Became difficult to convince the local organisers that press conferences were not needed- Press conferences were a waste of time- Split captaincy does not work in the Indian set-up. It's the right time to step down. This team has the potential to win more games than any other team has.",general,3297,59,70

City on Mars possible within our lifetime: Elon Musk,"Los Angeles, Jun 15 (PTI) Human colonies on Mars could be built within our lifetime, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk who has outlined his vision for a self-sustaining city on the red planet in a new study. In the study, Musk explored the planetary options for expanding to a space-bearing civilisation and described the advantages Mars offers. He provided a comprehensive review of a system architecture required for a rocket and spaceship capable of transporting people and supplies to Mars, comparing possible vehicle designs and performance features. A major challenge facing engineers and scientists at present is the need to reduce the cost per tonne of transporting materials to Mars by five million per cent. ""By talking about the SpaceX Mars architecture, I want to make Mars seem possible - make it seem as though it is something that we can do in our lifetime.

Erupting volcano with lightning wins photographer of year,"It could easily be mistaken as a CGI photo, given the stunning improbability of capturing a lightning bolt striking an angry, erupting volcano. But that?s precisely what earned a Mexican photographer the title of 2017 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year. Selected from more than 15,000 entries from participants in more than 30 countries, the photograph by Sergio Tapiro Valesco captures volcanic lightning -- also known as a dirty thunderstorm -- whereby a flash of lightning is produced within the ash cloud spewing from the volcano. Titled ?The Power of Nature,? the photo was taken 12 km away from the crater of the active volcano on a clear night. Glowing, angry lava, plumes of grey smoke and lightning bolts are set against a starlit night sky, producing visual testimony of nature?s brute force. For more than a decade, Velasco has been studying and photographing Mexico?s Colima volcano, also known as the ?Volcano of Fire.? He had been tracking the increase in activity and closely monitoring the volcano for almost a month, and positioned himself for the shoot, during which he heard an explosive booming noise. ?When I looked on the camera display, all I could do was stare,? Velasco said. ?What I was watching was impossible to conceive, the image showed those amazing forces of nature interacting on a volcano, while the lightning brightened the whole scene. It?s an impossible photograph and my once in a lifetime shot that shows the power of nature.? Follow @htlifeandstyle for more.",lifestyle,1518,57,70
Maha allots 250 hectares of forest land for airport project,"Having secured a Union government clearance to handover forest land for the proposed Navi Mumbai airport after much delay, the state government has formally set aside 250 hectares of forest land in Raigad district to the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) for the project.A delay in getting the forest land had held up crucial pre-development works for the Rs16,000-crore Navi Mumbai airport project. The state revenue and forests department issued a government resolution on Tuesday paving the way for the transfer of the said land, spread over 12 villages in the Panvel tehsil. An official from the state forests department said, ?The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests gave a clearance to transfer 250 hectare of forest land for the project with a few conditions in April this year. The government has already vetted the project in detail and it is established that it is a site-specific project and there is no alternative non-forest land available for it, so we have processed the transfer of land provided CIDCO adheres to the conditions put down by the Union government.?The airport is proposed to be built on 1,160 hectares of land, of which 250 hectares is forest land, including mangroves. Cidco has offered a green patch of 242 hectares in exchange near Khopoli and has assured to plant three times the amount of mangroves destroyed.Prajakta L. Verma, joint managing director at Cidco, said, ?In the absence of a clearance for the forest land, we had started basic surveys and soil investigations as part of the pre-development work. We started works such as rock cutting and blasting after getting a forest clearance. The state government?s resolution now paves the way for the official handover of the land and transfer of the title to enable us to work more smoothly.?The pre-development work involves flattening a hillock, reclaiming marsh land and diverting a river to make way for the construction of the airport, and is expected to take a year-and-a-half to complete. Cidco hopes to wind it up by mid-2018. With the forest land in possession, the only major challenge for the completion of the pre-development work is the rehabilitation of about 3,000 families. ?Most of the project-affected people have agreed to shift, while some have even started shifting out. A majority of the families are likely to shift once the rainy season is over,? Verma said.The state government first proposed the Navi Mumbai International airport 20 years ago, and accorded the plan an approval in 2007. The greenfield airport project has, however, faced several hiccups owing to resistance to land acquisition and delays in getting government clearances. Cidco now hopes to complete the project by 2020. The GVK-led Mumbai International Airport Ltd has won the bid to develop the new airport.",general,2817,59,70

New Alzheimer's test can predict when disease will appear,"Scientists have developed a new genetic test for Alzheimer?s risk that can be used to predict the age at which a person will develop the disease.A high score on the test, which is based on 31 genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found. Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimer?s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%.Rahul Desikan, of the University of California ? who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual?s risk of developing Alzheimer?s that year.?That is, if you don?t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information,? he said.The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimer?s disease and healthy elderly people.It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimer?s. Around a quarter of patients have a strong family history of the disease, and scientists have shown this is partly explained by a gene called ApoE, which comes in three versions, and is known to have a powerful influence on the risk of getting the most common late-onset type of Alzheimer?s. One version of ApoE appears to reduce risk by up to 40%, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by 12 times.The latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from ApoE, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on Alzheimer?s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial.The researchers first identified nearly 2,000 single letter differences in the genetic code (known as SNPs) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on 31 of the markers. The test was then used to accurately predict an individual?s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort.In people with the high-risk version of ApoE, those ranked in the top 10% of risk on the new test got Alzheimer?s at an average age of 84 years, compared with 95 years for those ranked in the lowest 10%.James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer?s Society, said: ?Preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of Alzheimer?s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition. This study?s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-US populations.? Pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic.Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer?s Research UK, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk. ?Genetics is only part of the story and we know that lifestyle factors also influence our risk of developing Alzheimer?s,? she said. ?The best current evidence points to habits we can all adopt to help lower our risk and indicates that what?s good for your heart is also good for the brain.?The findings are published in the journal PLOS Medicine.",health,3483,57,70
India prepares Israeli SPYDER air defence missile system,"The Indian Air Force will in the next few weeks finish weaving a security web with the Israeli SPYDER air defence missile system on the western borders in a bid to strengthen its preparedness to strike down any aerial threat from Pakistan.The induction process was delayed by over three years due to the nonavailability of Czech-made Tatra trucks on which the missiles were to be carried.""The SPYDER missile system is already in the process of deployment along the western borders where it will help in tackling any aircraft, cruise missile, surveillance plane or drone that tries to violate our airspace,"" senior defence sources told MAIL TODAY.WHAT IS SPYDER?The SPYDER (Surface-to-air PYthon and DERby) is a low-level, quick reaction missile (LLQRM) to neutralise hostile targets up to 15 km away and at heights between 20 and 9,000 metres. The Python-5 is currently the most capable air-to-air missile (AAM) in Israel's inventory, while the Derby is an active radar homing AAM that provides the SPYDER missile system with a fireand-forget option.""The IAF will use the SPYDER along with the made-in-India Akash surface-to-air missile which has a little longer effective range of 25 km as part of a layered approach to defend vital assets and locations in the country,"" the sources stated.DEAL MADE IN 2008The SPYDER deal was completed by the IAF with Rafael and Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) in 2008 and supplies were to begin in three to four years. But the process got delayed due to the unavailability of the Tatra trucks, which got mired in a controversy over bribery allegations.""Due to the lack of heavy specialised trucks, changes had to be made in the contract with the vendors and a made-in-India truck has been used for carrying the SPYDER system, which has been tested extensively resulting in delays,"" the sources said.Both the SPYDER and Akash are all-weather missiles and the process to seek and engage an aggressive aircraft or missile is automatic. Besides aircraft and UAVs, they can also neutralise lowlevel cruise missiles.The IAF has taken a slew of measures to strengthen its air defence capabilities in the recent past as it is also going to deploy another air defence system called the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) system from Israel, which can strike down targets at 50-70km.The force would receive a major boost when it starts getting the S-400 air defence missile system from Russia, which can take out targets at 400 km and can be very effective against enemy AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) and cruise missiles at great distances.ALSO READ:",general,2604,56,70

Thugs Of Hindostan not based on Pirates of Caribbean: Aamir,"Aamir Khan's action-adventure film, Thugs Of Hindostan, is said to be based on the thug culture in 19th century India.

It is an action adventure film but the story is not similar. There are some hundreds of action adventure films. There is Pirates Of The Caribbean, there is Indiana Jones and many others.

Yogi Adityanath waives farmers' loan upto ?1 lakh in UP,"Delivering on the Bharatiya Janata Party's poll promise, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today waived off farmers' loan of upto Rs 1 lakh. The decision taken in the first meeting of Adityanath Cabinet will add a burden of Rs 30,729 crore on the state exchequer and benefit nearly 2.15 crore farmers. Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off. The BJP, which won a massive majority bagging 312 seats in the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh Assembly, in its Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra (manifesto), had promised to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers.Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had said during campaigning that writing off farm loans would be among the foremost tasks of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.Although there is no Constitutional compulsion of convening the first cabinet meeting within a certain period, traditionally the ruling party has held it within a week or so of forming the government.The Adityanath government was sworn-in on March 19.Government sources said around 2.30 crore farmers in the state suffered losses due to natural calamities in the recent past and were unable to repay loans amounting to about Rs 62,000 crore.They also said that it could be difficult to handle the burden of loan waiver in a single financial year and that was one of the reasons to put the cabinet meeting on hold till a way was found to honour the prime minister's poll promise.With inputs from Balkrishna ALSO READ: Yogi Adityanath's first interview after taking charge of UP, says Ayodhya issue should be resolved through talksYogi Adityanath gives Uttar Pradesh's bureaucracy the jitters",general,2004,55,70
AIIMS docs to try separating twins joined at the head,"(Photo: PTI7_14_2017_000146B) New Delhi, Jul 14 (PTI) Doctors at AIIMS are examining a pair of two-year-old twins joined at the head, and will assess whether surgery can be performed to separate them. The twins -- Jagannath and Balram -- from Kandhamal district in Odisha, were taken to AIIMS after they were brought here from Bhubaneshwar this afternoon. They are accompanied by their parents and Assistant Manager of National Adolescent Health Programme, Soumya Samantray. Dr A K Mahapatra, chief of neuro sciences centre at AIIMS said the twins will undergo a series of tests such as MRI, CT scan, and angiogram, to see to what extent the veins in their brains are fused and whether surgery is feasible. ""They are craniopagus twins, that is who are connected at the head. This is a rare condition. It is very difficult at this stage to say if surgery is feasible to separate them. They will undergo several tests in the next 10-12 days after which we will decide,"" Dr Mahapatra said. Dr Deepak Gupta, professor of neurosurgery, said the conjoined twins suffer from a rare condition which afflicts one in 30 lakh children, of which 50 per cent die either at birth or within 24 hours. Surgery is feasible only on 25 per cent of the survivors while the rest continue to live with the condition. ""Also, there is less than a 20 per cent chance of survival among those who undergo this surgery.

CRPF DG refuses farewell parade to ease troops' burden,"A step to ease some pressure from a vast body of stressed troops has been taken.In what many have termed an 'unprecedented departure from an age-old norm', the Director General of the India's biggest central armed police force, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), K Durga Prasad has declined a farewell parade being planned for his retirement at the end of the month. This is, in his own words, keeping the 'convenience of the force in mind'.From being deployed for the conduct of elections to supporting counter-insurgency operations to aiding the police, the 239-battalion strong CRPF is among the most extensively deployed forces.WHY NO FAREWELL PARADEIn his first reaction, K Durga Prasad, a 1981 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer said, ""As such the CRPF is stretched. Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections. In this, a farewell parade would have meant that my personnel would be committed for an extended period to duties which are ceremonial in nature"". Instead, ""I visited my troops where they are, heard them and am trying to address their issues"", he said. Travelling over weekends, clearing files till late in the evening in office and camping for night halts between troop locations is indeed a norm for the present DG. He asked his staff to arrange a simple Guard of Honour to mark the end of his career. Durga Prasad enjoys the reputation of being a hands-on leader with his ear to the ground. From taking the Maoists head-on in united Andhra Pradesh as the leader of 'Greyhounds' force, he also held charge of the elite Special Protection Group (SPG) between November 2011 and November 2014. He also, as the Inspector General (IG), played a role in raising CRPF's own commando force, CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action). His choice, to many, reflects an acknowledgement of something being amiss.Also read | Exclusive: CRPF working on mobile app for its 3 lakh jawans A uniformed force functions on the principle of alternative posting for its personnel. From areas considered 'hard', personnel should be posted to areas considered 'soft'. This so that adequate rest, recuperation and training can be provided. However, forces like the CRPF have almost junked this principle. Rest, recuperation and training have been reduced merely to concepts on paper, say insiders. ""From a 50 per cent divide into hard and soft areas, the CRPF is more than 80 per cent into hard areas. Where is the room for respite?"", asked an informed source. DURGA PRASAD'S MOVE WELCOMEDAn officer of the CRPF, who has previously organised farewell parades termed Durga Prasad's decision a 'welcome move'. He recounted, ""For about a month, nearly 1,000 troops pooled in from all across the country march up and down in practice for the farewell parade at the CRPF training academy near Gurugram. In comparison, a Guard of Honour will involve not more than 100 troops"". DC Dey is a highly-regarded veteran, who retired as the Additional Director General of the CRPF. In his opinion, Durga Prasad's move deserves to be 'commended'. ""Someone retiring as a DG definitely deserves a show. However, very few outside have an idea of how much stress the force personnel are under. When elections are around the corner, we cancel all leaves"".",general,3266,54,70

Shouldn't rob their childhood: Aamir on kids reality shows,"Aamir Khan, whose last film Dangal told the story of two girls who grow up to become formidable wrestlers, says his upcoming movie Secret Superstar -- a musical drama -- is yet another film on the empowerment of the girl child.The film revolves around a teenager who dreams of becoming a famous singer.?Both Dangal and this film are based on the same topic... That we look differently at our daughters. And probably we aren?t able to give the same treatment to our daughters as our sons. So, Secret Superstar is another film based on empowerment of the girl child,? Aamir said here when asked about the message that Secret Superstar carries for the society.The actor was present at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday.Aamir, a father of three, feels the Indian film industry must make more films for children.?We should make more films for children. This film (Secret Superstar is for youngsters, but isn?t restricted to an age group. This is a family film... It has a wider scope. When our kids were younger, we used to show them foreign animated films which are only for kids. And that is definitely something we should do.?We don?t make enough films for kids in India,? Aamir said.Asked about the recent controversy surrounding children?s reality shows, ignited by filmmaker Amole Gupte, and spurred on by director Shoojit Sircar, Aamir weighed in.?Honestly, I haven?t seen those reality shows. But it cuts both ways (referring to kids getting platform to show their talent and they shouldn?t be overexposed). There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it gives them an opportunity. At the same time, we shouldn?t get so aggressive about it that we really rob them of their childhood,? Aamir said.After portraying the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal, Aamir will be seen in a very unusual avatar in Secret Superstar. He says he and his wife Kiran Rao were both very apprehensive about him taking up the role he plays.?When I heard the story for the first time, I loved it a lot. But Advait (director Advait Chandan) asked me to play Shakti Kumar?s character. I told him I couldn?t see myself in that role. Kiran also didn?t want me to do this role.?So, I decided to go through the screen test process. Then while doing the screen test, I had fun and this was a very unusual character, completely opposite of me. So it proved to be a challenge for me as an actor to make the audience believe in the character.?Kiran, who has co-producer the film, also spoke about not wanting Aamir to play the role.?I told him not to do this role as (I felt) he won?t be able to do it. It?s kind of a creepy character... He is a kind of guy who you really don?t want to hang out with alone in a room. So I told him, ?Please don?t do this role as it will be very weird to do such a character after a film like Dangal?.?But when we went through the screen test, we laughed so much that we were convinced he can do this role too. But he wasn?t the original fit.?When asked about the 100% success rate of his films on the box office and his secret for it, Aamir said: ?We just make films we believe in. I am just very fortunate with the films that we have made, the writers and directors that we work with and the talented people that come to us with the films that they want to make.?Somehow it all works out well in the end. I don?t know if it?s anything else to it other than the fact that we believe in what we make and we work with people who are very talented.?Secret Superstar also features Zaira Wasim along with Meher Vij. The film will release in October.Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,3628,59,70

The clearance was given on a review of the traffic regulation plan and provision for the RRTS alignment.

This is because the volume of traffic has remained the same despite the road being denotified as a highway,? he said.The proposed flyover, spanning 538 metres, is pegged at Rs50 crore and its design was changed from combined six-lane to three-lane (each side) split-type one. The middle portion between the two lanes will be used for the RRTS, which will come up on an elevated section, like the metro train system.The authority had proposed the flyover to decongest the city roads as a heavy volume of traffic is witnessed at the intersection.?The design for the flyover has been approved by the RRTS agency.

Under the new notification, scheduled to be issued next month, acid attack survivors will be treated as disabled, a senior official in the social justice and empowerment ministry said.At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acid attack survivors.PREVIOUS ACTSMinistry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 mentions only seven categories with people having 40per cent and above disability getting full benefits. In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person.""The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,"" the official said.The proposed move has come in from all-round praise from social activists.BENEFITS FOR ACID ATTACK VICTIMSLauding the move, Shaheen Malik of Delhi Commission for Women said: ""Adding acid attack survivors into special categories is one of the best things that this government is doing.""Now, this will ensure if the disabled do not get a private job, he or she can get government entitlements. Also, after an acid attack, our studies get discontinued due to financial losses, so now we can opt for higher studies too,"" Malik said.As per 2011 census, India has 26,810,557 people under disabled population. Government officials said once the new disability assessment guidelines come, all district medical officers will be advised to follow new norms in issuing the certificate.A ministry official said, ""Classification of a person's disability is being made with the difference of 10 per cent each. The health ministry is soon going to submit its report to the social justice and empowerment ministry and it will be notified soon. Presently, people with 40per cent and above disability are getting full benefits. Till then, existing guidelines have to be followed.""""All district medical officers would be trained to calculate percentage of disability and understand the new guidelines. It has been noticed that people misuse their disability for benefits, even if they are not eligible. We are making it more clear and stringent so that people with serious disability (40per cent and above) do not get neglected,"" the official said. The committee which drew the new guidelines worked in collaboration with the Union health ministry on the lines of global norms. This committee also formed sub-committees with experts from AIIMS, NIMHANS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia.Also Read",general,3234,52,70

V-C wants Army tank in JNU for nationalism in students,"At a Tiranga March organised in the Jawaharlal Nehru University ahead of the Kargil Vijay Diwas, the university vice-chancellor sought help to procure an Indian Army tank to be displayed inside the varsity premises. The Sunday?s gather at the university was unique in many ways. In attendance were minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, minister of state for external affairs VK Singh, Major General (retd) GD Bakshi and cricketer Gautam Gambhir. Only a handful of students, however, turned up for the advance celebration of Kargil Vijay Divas, which actually falls on July 26.Slogans such as Jahan hue balidaan Mukherjee (Syama Prasad Mukherjee), woh Kashmir humara hai. Sare ka sara humara hai (The Kashmir where Mukherjee died is ours) echoed on a relatively empty JNU campus as a group of over 300 people walked, fluttering the tri-colour, from the main gate to the convention centre. During the programme, JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, who stood in support of the march, requested Dharmendra Pradhan, and VK Singh, to procure an army tank to be exhibited in JNU. ?We request you to help us procure an army tank so that it could be put in JNU. The tank will remind students of the great sacrifices and valour of Indian Army.?Terming it as a defeat of the ?anti-national? forces in JNU, the slogans ?Naxalwad na Maowad, sabse upar Rashtrawad (no Naxalism or Maoism only nationalism,? and ?Pakistan Murdabad (down with Pakistan),? were raised as the crowd followed people leading the protest with the 600-metre-long flag.On the evening of February 9, 2016, JNU students were accused of raising anti-India slogans on the campus at an event to mark the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru and were booked for sedition.Even though the event, a part of the Vidya Veerta Abhiyan initiative of the Ministry of HRD, was to be joined by JNU students, there were only a handful of them. The event was also attended by relatives of martyrs.?Jahan kiya jhande ka apman, ab wahin hoga jhande ka samman,? said a participant. Everyone repeated followed by whistles, claps and the chants of ?Bharat Mata ki Jai?.Saurabh Sharma, vice-president, ABVP called the march ?historic?. ?ABVP led today?s historic march along with the veterans of Indian Army and JNU students and teachers. JNU is now changing. The students are understanding the meaning of true nationalism. Earlier JNU only spoke about Maoism, now it nationalism it taking roots here,? he said.Major General (retd) GD Bakshi termed JNU as a ?new and transformed campus?. Taking a jibe at the Left-leaning students in JNU he said, ?See how we turned things around. We want to make them understand how people in the Army lay down their lives. Last year, what happened at JNU was a clear show of shamelessness by separatist forces.?Talking about how an institution must impart not just knowledge but also values, he said. ?Today we made sure to send a message across to those who do not get what nationalism is by hoisting the Indian flag here. Those people were against putting Indian flag on the campus. I ask them why? How dare they say that? Is this our land or Pakistan?s? Why won?t the flag be here? Today, they have been answered,? he said.Supreme Court advocate Monika Arora voiced the same opinion. ?Those people who shouted slogans were followers of Marx and Stalin, the people who not only destroyed themselves but also the countries they belonged to, with their ideas. These ideas spread like a disease and if not treated then it develops into gangrene.? Reacting to the event, Amal, vice-president JNU Students Union, said that everyone has the right to conduct a programme but they should also respect the right to dissent. ?They can hold their programmes and say what they wish but why have they been curtailing the voices of dissent. Each time we screen a film or hold an event that does not suit their agenda, they send notices to us. When we do not have a problem with them holding events, they why stop us? They call such events patriotic but they just use them as an opportunity to recruit people in RSS,? he said.",general,4127,54,70
ScoopWhoop's ex-employee alleges molestation by Co-founder,"After a series of allegations on social media from several women complaining of sexual harassment, Mumbai Police registered an FIR against CEO and founder of The Viral Fever, Arunabh Kumar. He came out and addressed the accusations made against him and said ""I am a heterosexual, single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she's sexy. I compliment women. Is that wrong?"". The comment obviously did not help his case and he faced massive backlash for the same. After the incident, there were various debates and discussions on work place ethics and sexual harassment. Almost 15 days later, another similar incident has come to light. An FIR has been filed against ScoopWhoop co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and sexual assault, as reported by Catch News. Along with Suparn Pandey, other co-founders have also been named though for abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.A former senior executive of ScoopWhoop Media Pvt. Ltd filed the FIR at the Vasant Kunj (South) police Station, Delhi. The accused has been charged with section 354 A (sexual harassment), section 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman), and section 506 (criminal intimidation), reported Catch News. The complainant has claimed that during her tenure at ScoopWhoop, which lasted two years, she faced 'inappropriate comments and lewd remarks' the entire time. Pandey even went on to comment on her sexuality. ""Mr. Suparn Pandey in public commented on my sexuality and this comment included calling me a names (sic.) which reflected on my sexual orientation and my sexual preferences (sic.) as well as characterised me in a certain way"", states the FIR according to a Catch News report . Her ordeal was not limited to verbal harassment, the complainant has claimed that Pandey repeatedly got 'uncomfortably close', 'often trying to play with her hair' . He unabashedly even sent her a lewd video on the company's official Gmail chat, the FIR alleges. 'Mr. Pandey got so bold as to send me a lewd video over the official Gmail chat, in which the words were ""aapnu jeans dheeli karo""', reads the FIR. ScoopWhoop's inactionWhen the complainant, took up the matter with ScoopWhoop co-founder Sriparna Tikekar, she assured her that such behaviour would not be repeated. However, apparently she did not take any action against Pandey. The former senior executive did not stop raising the issue with the company's founders even after realising that it had no repercussions for Pandey. She was instead publicly humilated and was allegedly forced to work in close quarters with Pandey. If she was refused, she was ""reprimanded and humiliated"".Suparn Pandey used to show up to work drunk and would try to touch the complainant. She decided to quit after Pandey crossed all limits. 'Mr. Pandey approached me after the meeting, between 8-9:30PM, when I was alone at my work desk and asked me to be less ""aggressive"" in my dealings with other people and learn to ""pour some sugar on it."" That after that, he then got up, kissed my forehead and walked away,' the complainant recounts in the FIR . She was allegedly dissuaded from lodging a formal complaint and the co-founders threatened to hurt her career and defame her publicly. Following a series of complaints and threats, she resigned from ScoopWhoop.",general,3303,58,70
Pak bans 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed's new terror front,"After placing Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD)'s Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30, Pakistan has now banned his new terror front Tehreek-e-Azadi-Jammu & Kashmir (TAJK).JuD was declared a terrorist outfit by the US in 2014 and and was again put under the watch list on January 27. The Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA ) put TAJK on the list of proscribed organisations on June 8, forcing Saeed to run his activities under the TAJK banner. Hafiz Saeed had adopted the name JuD after its terror outfit, Laskar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) that basically perpetrates terror in India, was banned by Pakistan on 14 January 2002 under international pressure. However, it did not affect him. In December 2008, the UN Security Council, under its Resolution 1267, imposed sanctions on JuD and Hafiz Saeed for supporting Al Qaeda and Taliban. India had named Hafiz Saeed, LeT and JuD as the perpetrators of the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. Since then there has been an unending drama of Hafiz Saeed being put under house arrest or detained cursorily before being set free even if the US declared a bounty of USD 10 million on his head in 2012. Things took a turn after Donald Trump was elected president in the United States. The US clearly told Pakistan to act against JuD after its name prominently figured in the report of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. If Pakistan failed to comply to this it would be put on the list of blacklisted countries in the International Cooperative Review Group (ICRG). That would make it necessary for Pakistan to put a formal request each time it went about transacting any business through any of the international financial institutions. Left with no other option, Pakistan had to put Hafiz Saeed under house arrest on January 30. Even if symbolic, it made a huge difference that we can see now with TAJK ban, as Donald Trump is completing six months in office. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump in a joint statement, during Indian PM's US tour, labeled Pakistan a terror haven. Not to mention the US has designated Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist. Pakistan, probably, was expecting all this to happen, and therefore would have decided to act on Hafiz Saeed's new terror front before it became another international rallying point against it.",general,2381,56,70

Delhi govt raises acid attack victims' compensation to ?7L,"The AAP government on Monday told the Delhi High Court that it has raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7 lakh the compensation for acid attack victims.The submission was made before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, who was hearing the plea of several women who are victims of acid attack against the cap on compensation to be awarded in such cases.Delhi government?s counsel Arun Panwar further informed the court that they have even directed all the hospitals in the capital, including hospitals under central government to provide free treatment to such victims.Panwar assisted by advocate Ayushi Gupta also submitted that if the hospitals do not provide free treatment to acid attack victims, contempt action will be taken against them.The women, who were rendered visually impaired besides other wounds as a result of the attack, have sought enhancement of the Rs 3 lakh compensation awarded to them by Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) in 2016.They have also sought removal of the cap on compensation awarded under the Delhi Victims Compensation Scheme.In addition to the enhanced compensation, they have sought directions to the Delhi government to reimburse the transportation cost incurred by them during their treatment.To which, the court has asked the authorities concerned to file a status report by March 20 indicating the policy with regard to reimbursement of money spent in transportation by the victims.Their plea also claims that while world over there are strict laws against use of acid and such attacks, in India the law is lacking in many respects as it does not address the issues of speedy investigation, expedited trials for survivors and inadequate compensation as most surgeries cost Rs three lac per procedure and victims sometimes need to undergo several operations.",general,1792,58,70

81% of fund for malnourished kids went unused in Maharashtra,"Only 19% or Rs339.9crore of Rs1,339crore released by the state government to provide food for malnourished children was used between April and June 2017, according to an analysis by the National Centre for Advocacy Studies (NCAS), which is based in Pune. Of the spent money under the Centre?s Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), most of it was used for the Take Home Ration (THR) scheme, which provides ready-to-cook food items to infants from 0 to 3 years, adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women.

H-1B visas for Indian IT companies won't come down: Minister,"New Delhi, May 20 (PTI) Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today sought to calm frayed nerves on the contentious visa issue, saying the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals would not come down. She asked the industry not to get panicky. ""No need to get panicky on the visa front. The lottery process is something I suppose they (the US) wanted to do a correction on. The numbers are not something they are changing... the numbers will not come down,"" Sitharaman told reporters here. Over the past few weeks, there is a growing sentiment of protectionism across various developed economies, including the US, seeking to safeguard jobs for locals and raise the bar for foreign workers. In the US, the Trump administration wants to replace the current lottery system with a more merit-based immigration policy. A mere 17 per cent of total US visas go to Indian companies and a number of American firms benefit from services provided by Indian firms, she noted. India has time and again expressed hope that the review of H-1B visa process will take into consideration the positive relationship between the two countries. Any change in visa norms can affect the movement of labour as well as spike operational costs for IT players. In response to the proposed tightening of the visa regime, Indian IT firms have been ramping up hiring of locals in the US, a market that accounts for almost 60 per cent of the Indias technology export revenues. On changes in the selection process for H-1B visa, the minister hoped that ""where the high skill set is required, they (US) would look for that, rather than for first time graduates"". The selection for such visas is getting selective, but the ""numbers are not changing"". ""No need of getting panicky... because the number of H-1B visas that we have got, we will continue to get that,"" she promised. US President Donald Trump in April had signed an executive order for tightening the H-1B visa programme to stop its ""abuse"" and ensure the visas are given to the ""most- skilled or highest paid"" petitioners, a decision that is seen to impact Indias USD 150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concern over the issue as these visas were mainly used for short-term work in the US. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations.",general,2550,60,70
International Tiger Day observed on July 29,"The global tiger day was created to think of the needs of a wild tiger. Sadly we have forgotten this primary objective. What I am going to do is to spell out the Indian tiger?s wishlist in the hope that those that engage with tigers will rethink and review their strategies.The most important item on the wishlist is to see a mindset change in the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) where this specially created institution starts to imbibe field wisdom about wild tigers through innovative strategies on both protection and tourism. Tigers love well-managed visitors. They keep the forest staff on alert and can provide vital information on illegal grazing, wood felling and poaching. After all, there are hundreds of more eyes and ears looking and hearing. In places where tourism is low, tigers have suffered hugely. The NTCA must learn to respect site-specific initiatives of state governments that can through tourism revenue make our tiger reserves self sufficient. This in turn provides field directors to undertake vital protection work without bureaucratic delays. The NTCA in the last decade has discouraged tourism and endlessly interfered with state government policy seriously impacting the health of tigers. Managing tigers is a state subject and the NTCA must be in the role of facilitator and not policeman.The chief wildlife wardens of the states are vital to the tigers? wishlist. They need to take bold and innovative decisions that inspire the field staff. They need to engage with local communities in the effort to protect tigers. They need to ensure that all vacant positions are filled and chief ministers engaged with all the issues that confront wild tigers. State-of-the-art training is an essential element in the quality of governance that is needed to protect tigers. Retired army officers can instruct on field craft, retired intelligence officials on gathering intelligence on poachers and their syndicates. Our country can offer the best talent to secure the future of wild tigers. Inter-state cooperation is vital to good governance and even more important than linking up with the central government. Rajasthan has held such a meeting with Maharashtra so that both can imbibe best practices from each other. Choose forest staff with care. Good decisions are made by those who spend time understanding tigers. Ignorant decisions damage the future of tigers. The four or five big NGOs must revitalise their thinking and prevent duplication. Focus on specific trouble spots and solve problems with tactical help to the forest staff. Do not beat your own drum. Partner with local communities. The future of tigers will lie in how communities engage in protection. The time for sweet talking them is over. Gather the young and train them into tiger protectors.All this requires strong political will. Tigers need chief ministers at their side. Their instructions are vital to innovative initiatives and this is where strong partnerships between the government and non-governmental sector can trigger the necessary political will. Frequent meetings of the state board of wildlife that chief ministers chair are vital to resolving the tigers? problems.The Prime Minister of the country must play his role for the sake of our national animal. The Prime Minister chairs the national board for wildlife and frequent meetings are a must. The full board has not met for four years. This is the moment to meet and the best experts must apprise the Prime Minister of the tigers? needs.These are the five points on the wish list of India?s wild tigers. And who says it is not possible? Rajasthan has shown the way. Under the supervision of the chief minister, the Ranthambhore tiger reserve has shown the highest amount of tigers ever now touching 65 with the highest tourist revenue now touching 4 million dollars just on entry ticket revenue. It has some of the best local community monitoring and protection and a genuine partnership with field forest staff. It has the best tourism practices and regular monthly meetings of an empowered committee that reports back to the chief minister. For the first time ever, extra tourism revenue is going to new tiger habitats that suffered tremendously due to limited funds.Where there is a will there is a way. It is up to all of us to make it the day of the tiger.Valmik Thapar has worked for 42 years with wild tigers. He has also written 30 books on India?s tigers and wildlife",world,4455,43,70

"GST will be India's economic freedom, says Anil Ambani","Mumbai, Jun 29 (PTI) Industrialist Anil Ambani today termed the Goods and Services Tax (GST), being rolled out from July 1, as Indias ""economic freedom"" and said it would make the country the biggest free and democratic market in the history of humankind. Speaking here at a mutual fund industry event, the Reliance Group chairman said there are many ways of counting the benefits of GST and as many of counting its costs. ""But there is just one way of describing its true promise. GST is not just another piece of reform or transform, however significant. GST is the liberation of our economic imagination. It is our economic freedom,"" he said. Ambani said there are moments in the life of a nation when history is made not in small steps of incremental gain but in giant leaps of ambition. ""We, the people of India, are privileged to bear witness to one such moment in time,"" he said, referring to the proposed rollout of GST on midnight of June 30. ""Seventy years ago, at the stroke of the mid-night hour, our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, spoke movingly in the Central Hall of Parliament about Indias tryst with destiny. ""At the same mid-night hour tomorrow, as our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi rises to address a waiting nation from the same august Central Hall, India will be set on course for another historic tryst with destiny,"" he said. Ambani said the free market is perhaps the greatest force for economic good in human history of all earthly inventions. He said the free market is a force for generating wealth and transforming lives and the real promise of GST is promise of economic liberation. With the promise of One Nation, One Tax, One Market, it would create a borderless world of 1.3 billion people -- producers and consumers engaged in a seamless exchange of goods and services, skill sets and capital, labour and ideas. Ambani said the world has seen nothing like this before and in less than 48 hours, India will emerge as the biggest free and democratic market in the history of humankind. ""In tandem with its policy precursor -- demonetisation -- GST will forever change the ground rules of doing any kind of trade, commerce or business in India.",general,2194,54,70
Imran Khan accused of harassing women party leaders,"A woman parliamentarian of Imran Khan?s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has stirred up a major row by accusing the cricketer-turned-politician of sending her ?obscene? text messages and harassing women leaders of the party.Ayesha Gulalai, elected to the National Assembly in 2013 from a reserved seat for women in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, also announced her decision to quit the PTI because she could not compromise on her honour and dignity.Addressing a news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday, Gulalai said the ?honour? of women in the PTI is not safe because of 64-year-old Khan, whom she called a ?fake Pathan?. Gulalai, who hails from the conservative South Waziristan tribal region and is the sister of leading squash player Maria Toorpakai, said Khan is a ?characterless person? who considers himself an angel but his conduct is ?highly indecent?. There was no response to the allegations from Khan though PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry dismissed Gulalai?s allegations and claimed she had ?sold her soul? for money.The lawmaker said she had received numerous text messages from Khan, and the first one was sent from his Blackberry in October 2013. She declined to read out the messages but asked journalists to contact the telecom authority in this context. She urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the matter for the sake of the honour of women members of the PTI as there is speculation that Khan might one day become the prime minister. Gulalai said her decision to quit the PTI had nothing to do with a case regarding Khan?s assets that is being heard by the Supreme Court. ?The criterion for awarding party tickets is entirely different in the PTI,? she said.She said she had the courage to come out against Khan and his clan as she is a brave Pathan and honour was more important to her. The lawmaker went on to say that Khan was more impressed by Western culture and wanted to replicate it in Pakistan.?Their change is confined to social media while workers like me work on the ground, whom they call inferior workers. When I used to attend meetings, Imran Khan gave tips on how to ridicule rivals and target them,? she said.Gulalai also accused the PTI government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of corruption and said chief minister Pervez Khattak was acting like a ?mafia boss?.She rejected reports that she was joining the PML-N party of former premier Nawaz Sharif but praised him for respecting women.",world,2439,51,70

India's longest bridge to be inaugurated on May 26 by PM Modi,"India's longest river bridge, capable of withstanding the weight of a 60-tonne battle tank, will be inaugurated in Assam close to the border with China on May 26 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.With the inauguration of the 9.15-km-long Dhola-Sadiya bridge over the Brahmaputra river, the prime minister will kick start the celebrations of the NDA government's three years in office from this eastern-most part of Assam.The bridge is seen as an attempt by India to shore up its defence requirements along the Sino-Indian border particularly in the Northeast besides providing easy access to the people of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam with air and rail connectivity.It is 3.55 km longer than the Bandra-Worli sea link in Mumbai, making it the longest bridge in India.""The prime minister will dedicate the strategically important bridge to the nation on May 26. It will bolster the road connectivity in the Northeast as the bridge will be used by people of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh besides defence forces extensively,"" Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told PTI.BRIDGE CAN WITHSTAND MOVEMENT OF MILITARY TANKSThe construction of the bridge began in 2011 at a project cost of Rs 950 crore. The design is such that the bridge can withstand the movement of military tanks.""Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have huge strategic value to the country. Since the bridge is located close to our border with China, it will help quick movement of military troops and artillery in times of conflict,"" Sonowal said.The bridge is located 540-km away from Assam capital Dispur and 300 km away from Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar. The aerial distance to the Chinese border is less than 100 km.After Kaliabhomora bridge near Tezpur, there is no bridge over the Brahmaputra for the next 375 km upstream till Dhola, where the new bridge is constructed. Currently, all the transport between the two banks of the river are being carried out through water only.BRIDGE TO CUT DOWN TRAVEL TIMEThe bridge, when opened for the public, will cut down the travel time between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh by as much as four hours.As there is no civilian airport in Arunachal Pradesh, this bridge will help people of the state to reach the nearest rail head in Tinsukia and the airport in Dibrugarh easily.Sonowal said the delayed works of the bridge was expedited after Modi assumed the charge in 2014. The bridge was originally scheduled to open in 2015.The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Assam will complete one year in office on May 24.The bridge is one of the key projects of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the Northeast and is built in public-private partnership with a construction company.

A section of sanitation workers, however, continued to protest outside the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) headquarter on Saturday, the tenth day of the strike, to demand payment of pending dues. These workers, too later, hinted that they might join work after a final meeting with EDMC commissioner Mohanjeet Singh on Monday morning.East Delhi is divided into two districts, Shahdara south and Shahdara north.

""I think if they wanted me to, I would love to be the mediator or arbitrator.""Haley was answering a question from a reporter at her news conference on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month of April.The reporter pointed out that India does not want an interlocutor for talks with Pakistan, while Islamabad wanted the US or another country to facilitate talks between them and asked if the US would get the leaders of the two countries to talk.With Secretary of State Rex Tillerson keeping a low public profile and generally avoiding the media, Haley is emerging as the public face of US diplomacy making her presence felt in the media aided by her cabinet status.Her statement about India-Pakistan relations, therefore, assume importance and it is the first high-level Trump administration statement on India's relations with Pakistan.While it is not clear what steps the US could take, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet Trump in Washington in May when the two could discuss it.",general,2021,55,70
Chinese Army capable of defeating invading armies: Prez,"The People?s Liberation Army (PLA) has the capability to defeat ?invading? enemies and protect the country?s sovereignty, President Xi Jinping told China?s armed forces on Sunday amid the Sino-India military standoff at the Donglang area near the Sikkim border.Addressing a military parade to mark the 90th anniversary of the PLA at the Zhurihe combat training base in Inner Mongolia, Xi in camouflage military fatigue, said, ?The PLA has the confidence and capability to defeat all invading enemies and protect China?s national sovereignty, security and development interests.??The PLA also has the confidence and capability to build a stronger military and make new and greater contribution to realising China?s two centenary goals and the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation, and safeguarding world peace,? Xi was quoted as having said by the official media. In this photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops perform a flag raising ceremony for the parade. (AP) There was no direct reference to India or any mention of the ongoing military standoff in the Donglang (Doklam) area in the excerpts of Xi?s speech released by the official media but the reference to ?invading enemies? seems to be clear indication who the Chinese President was talking about.China?s officials and media have repeatedly alleged that Indian troops had ?invaded? and ?illegally trespassed? into Chinese territory in Donglang by crossing an established border in Sikkim.It was the first time that Xi presided over such a large military parade in the field, official news agency, Xinhua reported.The Xinhua report added that Xi stood in an open-roof vehicle that drove slowly past troop formations to a backdrop of military music.In this photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops march in formation as they arrive for the military parade. (AP) The report said: ?Every few moments, Xi called out ?Salute to you, comrades,? to which assembled troops responded ?Hail to you, chairman?.?Xi alternated the greeting with ?Comrades, thanks for your hard work,? to which soldiers replied ?Serve the people!??Follow the Party! Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!? Servicemen and women exclaimed to Xi.China has blamed India for the ongoing impasse, accusing Indian soldiers of trespassing and preventing Chinese soldiers from building a road in the region which is also claimed by Bhutan.Beijing wants India to withdraw its troops from Donglang before the two sides can open talks. New Delhi says the road, if built, will have serious security implications for India.Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi has so far been the highest ranking Chinese politician to have directly blamed India on the military impasse.Wang told reporters in Bangkok last week that the ?problem was very straightforward? and that ?even Indian officials publicly said that Chinese soldiers didn?t enter the Indian territory. In other words, Indian side admitted (crossing) into Chinese territory.?The resolution of the problem is very ?simple?, he said: ?Indian troops have to go out?.Xi?s mentioning of ?invading enemies? is very significant as he is both general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central Military Commission.",world,3338,56,70

In the break-up letter Tupac writes: ?For you to be seen with a black man wouldn?t in any way jeopardize your career ? if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting.

Misconception that underworld invested money in B'wood: RGV,"Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma says contrary to the popular perception, underworld never invested money into Bollywood and there was never really a ""nexus"" between them. Varma says the activities of underworld with regard to Bollywood were mostly limited to making calls to either scare celebrities or help their friends. ""Its a misconception that theres a nexus between underworld and Bollywood. Underworld never put money, which again is a misconception. If underworld also has to put money, why is it underworld? It defeats the purpose,"" Varma told reporters last evening. ""Most of the times, either they use it for publicity, they used to get high in scaring who we think are our stars and big filmmakers. But the underworld at that time was in the mood of being in the news. They were very publicity crazy at that time."" The filmmaker was speaking at a special event where he unveiled the teaser of his upcoming web series ""Guns and Thighs"", which chronicles the rise and fall of the Mumbai underworld. ""By 2004, most of the gangsters were killed and they lost a lot of power. Disbanding the encounter squad was a signal that underworld as a force has been completely reduced."" The director, known for making several gangster-dramas like ""Satya"", ""Company"" and ""D"", says he has never been at the receiving end of the underworld because of his films. ""If I am still alive that means I am not at the receiving end. Why would the underworld have any problem with anyone making a film."" His web-series will have four seasons of ten episodes each in which Varma says he has ""pushed the envelope"" when it comes to the content as the digital medium offers freedom to tell stories the way one wants to. Asked whether it is hard not to glorify someone, especially when one is making a film on gangsters, Varma says, ""Gabbar Singh is the most loved character, but I dont know if a single person got inspired to become a dacoit in Chambal valley after seeing Sholay.",entertainment,1977,59,70
Amit Shah rules out resumption of Indo-Pak bilateral cricket,"(Eds: With additional quotes of BJP chief Amit Shah) Mumbai, Jun 17 (PTI) BJP president Amit Shah today ruled out resumption of bilateral cricket ties between India and Pakistan anytime soon, saying the two countries would continue to play against each other in international tournaments. ""India and Pakistan will continue to play at international tournaments but neither India plays in Pakistan nor Pakistan plays in India,"" Shah, who heads the Gujarat Cricket Association, told reporters, a day ahead of the clash between the arch rivals in the Champions Trophy final in England. On Kashmir issue, Shah said the states PDP-BJP government was working on a solution which will ""change the current picture"". He, however, did not elaborate on what the solution to the vexed issue could be. When asked about the recent attacks on security forces in Kashmir, Shah said, ""Such a situation has been there since 1989... violence erupts after a lull of few weeks or months. BJP and PDP are working on some solutions and the change will be seen soon."" Shah, who is here on a three-day visit to strengthen the party organisation in the state, and is scheduled to meet Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, said BJP would consult its allies before finalising the NDAs presidential candidate. He was responding to questions at a press conference about ally Shiv Sena, which has often been critical of the BJP and the Modi government, suggesting the name of M S Swaminathan, known for steering India?s Green Revolution, as its presidential choice. The Shiv Sena had earlier said it may choose an ""independent"" path in the election to the highest constitutional office. It had backed Congress nominees -- Pratibha Patil and Pranab Mukherjee -- in the last two presidential elections. Shah defended the approach of his party in meeting opposition leaders over presidential election without proposing a name. He said if BJP proposed a name to them, there would not be discussion. ""If we suggest a name of the candidate then they (opposition) will think that the name has already been finalised. Then there will not be any scope for discussion. Hence, we are asking them to suggest names,"" said Shah. ""Once the names have been suggested, we will finalise our name for the post of president,"" he said. ""We will consult all our allies and then reach a decision on the presidential poll nominee,"" he said. When asked about Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis remark that the BJP was prepared for snap assembly election, in an apparent reference to continued strain in ties with the Shiv Sena, Shah said, ""What he meant was that if mid-term polls are forced on us, we are ready to fight."" He went on to add that ""I think the government is going to complete its five-year term. But, if the situation arises, we will not run away from the battleground and contest the election and win it."" Speaking about the recent farm loan waiver announced by the Maharashtra government, Shah said, ""Through it we are offering relief to the farmers. The burden of loan waiver will be on the government and not banks. ""The NPAs that are largely talked about are the ones we have inherited from the previous government. We are also improving the situation of the banks in our country."" Maharashtras agriculture growth rate was in negative (minus 8 per cent) a few years back. Today, it stands at 20 per cent, which is a huge achievement of the Fadnavis government, he said. The water conservation programme-- Jalyukta Shivar-- has also yielded good results, Shah said. Calling Narendra Modi the most popular leader since Independence, Shah said the prime minister was making all efforts to transform India into a world power by 2022, when the nation celebrates 75 years of freedom. Under Modi, he said, India had become the worlds fastest growing major economy. The BJP chief said Modi had restored dignity to the prime ministers office. ""Every minister in the previous UPA government considered himself the PM, but nobody considered the PM as PM,"" he said. Lauding Modi for enacting the Goods and Services Tax law, the BJP leader said nobody else had the ""daring or capability"" to do it.",sports,4155,60,70
Hotel room where Sunanda Pushkar died not opened in 3 years,"The Delhi police on Friday told a city court that they could not de-seal the room at a five star hotel, where former Congress minister Shashi Throor? wife Sunanda Pushkar was found dead. More than three years after the incident, police have not been able to reach a conclusion and said they will take more time to investigate. Replying to a court order, police said that despite two visits by Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) experts and five different reports from medical boards, they are yet to find out how she was murdered. The police said they will need more time to inspect the room, thereby delaying the case. Read: A timeline of Sunanda Pushkar murder caseThe room has been sealed by Delhi police since January 2014. The police had come under heavy criticism for its handling of the case. A murder case was registered more than a year after she was found dead in suite 345 of the Hotel Leela Palace in New Delhi. In a plea, the hotel had earlier told court that closing the room for the last three years had caused them losses. Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma on Friday directed the Station House Officer (SHO) of Sarojini Nagar police station to file a report by coordinating with the forensic team on the time and the number of visits they would need to inspect the room one last time before concluding their investigation.The court has fixed the next date of hearing on July 14, 2017.The hotel said in its plea that it has on previous occasions approached the Delhi Police for their assistance in unsealing the suite. ?The investigating agencies have visited the suite and collected requisite samples on numerous occasions. But, since a year, no investigating agency has visited the suite and therefore the it is not required to be kept sealed any longer,? the hotel had said in its application.According to the hotel?s plea, there are 17 suites in the hotel and the cost for a night?s stay ranges from Rs 55,000 - 61,000, depending on the season. But, the hotel?s inability to offer suite number 345 to its patrons in the last three years has reportedly resulted in a loss of approximately Rs 50 lakh.Pushkar was found dead at the five-star hotel in south Delhi?s Chanakyapuri on January 17, 2014, after which the suite was sealed. Pushkar?s viscera samples were sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) lab in Washington DC to determine the type of poison that killed her after an AIIMS medical board identified poisoning as the reason behind her death. The board did not specify the type of poison and asked police to send the samples to a lab outside India.",general,2604,59,70
Indian national arrested in Pakistan,"An Indian national has been arrested in Islamabad on Sunday allegedly over incomplete travel documents. According to Pakistan local media, a case has also been filed under Article 14 of the Foreign Act. According to police, the man identified as Sheikh Nabi, a resident of Mumbai, was detained during routine patrol in F-8 area of the capital on May 19 after he failed to produce any travel or visa documents.

However, he could not produce any documents and was taken into police custody. An official of the Indian High Commission, however, said that the mission does not have any information about the arrest so far.The arrest came days after the International Court of Justice stayed the execution of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of ""involvement in espionage and sabotage activities"" against the country.The ""suspicious person"" has been booked under the Foreigners Act, 1946.

Chinese folk medicines inspire new 'molecular condoms',"Los Angeles, May 16 (PTI) Chemicals found in Chinese folk medicines may be used to make next generation of molecular condoms that may serve as a safe alternative to todays hormone-based contraceptives, scientists say. The chemicals, extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, are effective at low doses and have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, other than preventing a key step in fertilisation - the meeting of egg and sperm. They work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. According to researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in the US, the chemicals may serve as an emergency contraceptive taken either before or after intercourse, or as a permanent contraceptive via a skin patch or vaginal ring. Human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick. Also, because the chemicals prevent fertilisation, they may be a more acceptable alternative in the eyes of those who object to emergency contraceptives that prevent the implantation of a potentially viable fertilised egg. These two plant compounds block fertilisation at very low concentrations - about 10 times lower than levels of levonorgestrel in emergency contraceptives, said Polina Lishko, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley. ""They could be a new generation of emergency contraceptive we nicknamed molecular condoms,"" said Lishko, who led the team that discovered the anti-fertility properties of the two chemicals. ""If one can use a plant-derived, non-toxic, non-hormonal compound in lesser concentration to prevent fertilisation in the first place, it could potentially be a better option,"" she said. Purusing books on natural contraceptives used by indigenous peoples around the world, researchers came across several non-steroid chemicals isolated from anti-fertility plants. One of these was pristimerin, from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii, also known as ""thunder god vine."" Leaves from the plant have been used as an antifertility drug in Chinese traditional medicine, though some compounds in the leaves are poisonous. It has also been used as a folk remedy for rheumatoid arthritis. The other chemical was lupeol, which is found in plants such as mango and dandelion root. While it has been tested as an anticancer agent, it was not suspected of having contraceptive properties.",health,2576,54,70

You can operate when body is healthy: PM Modi on note ban,"Defending his decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the best time to launch demonetisation is when the economy is in good shape. ""Since the economy was in strong condition, the timing of demonetisation was the best,"" Modi said in Lok Sabha during his reply to the Motion of Thanks on President Pranab Mukherjee's address. ""When can you have an operation? When the body is healthy. The economy was doing well and thus our decision was taken at the right time,"" he said.""Like Swachh Bharat, the decision on demonetisation is a movement to clean India (from corruption and black money),"" Modi said today.""I am taking such decisions which are hurting big people and because of that I am going to face problems. I am ready for that."" he said.Modi's defence of demonetisation, however, runs counter to many top economists, who had protested the decision when the Indian economy was doing well. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also a renowned economist, had called demonetisation a ""monumental mismanagement"" and ""organised loot and legalised plunder"". Development economist Jean Dreze had used a racing analogy. ""Demonetisation in a booming economy is like shooting at the tyres of a racing car,"" he had said.On November 8 last year, Modi, in a televised address, announced the banning of high currency notes - a decision he said was aimed at checking black money and terror funding. The decision triggered massive protest from the Opposition and chaos outside banks and ATMs across the country following the massive cash crunch. There are also allegations of over a 100 deaths due to demonetisation.In his speech, Modi also attacked the Congress over the role of ""one family"" in the freedom struggle and said they had neglected the contribution of others. ""There are many people like me who couldn't die for the nation during the freedom struggle but we are living for India and serving India,"" Modi said during the debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's address. ""Somewhere on the way, 'Jan Shakti' (people power) was forgotten and we don't accept this,"" he said. ""I never heard them speak about the role of Chandrasekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and many other freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the country,"" Modi said.""They think the country got independence only due to one family,"" Modi said in an apparent attack on the Nehru dynasty. He said India had to be taken to newer heights.

Mumbai University directs colleges to speed up evaluation,"With just 30% degree-college teachers reporting for paper assessment, the University of Mumbai (MU) will issue notices to teachers who are yet to start assessment .An official, who is involved in MU?s assessment exercise, said the notice will inform the teachers the consequences of skipping assessment work. The university has prepared a list of more than 1,000 teachers from its affiliated colleges who will receive such notices, said the official.The Maharashtra Public Universities Act 2016 makes it mandatory for every teacher of the university, its affiliated, conducted colleges, community colleges and recognised institutions to assist the varsity in conducting examination and evaluation. ?If any teacher ... fails to comply with the order of the university ... the employee shall be liable for disciplinary action,? reads the act. So far, only 3,500 of the 11,500 evaluators have started assessment work even as the varsity races against the time to assess the answer sheets and declare the results. However, according to the official, many of the evaluators were enrolled with the varsity?s examination department recently and are yet to finish the formalities. The notices will only be served to those teachers who have done assessment work before.?The notice will serve as a warning to the teachers who are skipping assessment duties. While the university is not considering any action against errant teachers, it cannot be ruled out,? said the official.The university?s decision to adopt an on-screen assessment system has caused a huge delay in declaring results this year. Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, who also serves as chancellor of public universities in the state, has asked MU to declare results by July 30.

Women are sensual beings: Omji Maharaj,"Hindu Mahasabha president Swami Omji Maharaj, one of the panelists in Rahul Kanwal's primetime show Newsroom, made controversial remarks about women and held their dressing sensibilities accountable for sexual assaults they face in India. Omji, who described womem as sensual beings, was of the opinion that short skirts invite trouble and that women in burqa are safer. He said women, if not fully clothed, will attract sexual predators the way jaggery attracts flies.Omji's comments come at a time when millions across India are enraged by the Bengaluru mass molestation incident that happened on the New Year's Eve and the news of a woman groped and robbed in Bengaluru a couple of days before. Many people, including celebrities like Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, Farhan Akhtar, Anushka Sharma, Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu, Malaika Arora Khan and Virat Kohli, condemned the situation in India where women are unsafe regardless of the clothes they wear or where they are at, at any given point of time or whom they are with, but there are also many people who share Omji Maharaj's views.Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi had ignited outrage after he remarked that Indian women are trying to ape the western culture by opting to wear revealing clothes and made a statement similar to Omji, ""If there's gasoline, there will be fire. If there's spilt sugar, ants will gravitate towards it for sure,"" implying that women are responsible for inviting sexual predators. Azmi said, ""In these modern times, the more skin women show, the more they are considered fashionable. If my sister or daughter stays out beyond sunset celebrating December 31 with a man who isn't their husband or brother, that's not right.""Farhan Akhtar and Varun Dhawan, Bollywood actors, had expressed their contempt to Azmi's statement on Twitter. Women should not dress like westerners b'coz men dressed like westerners are molesters, says the man in the shirt.#oxy(deprived)moronsArgggh how this angers me.Sir punish the criminals not the victims. Women can wear what they want it's their choice. https://t.co/HSpRjlRq8AWhen one of the women panelists, senior lawyer Karuna Nundy asked Omji whether he thinks he has the right to touch a girl, standing fully nude in front of him, he said, ""many Bollywood actresses have come completely nude in front of me and even tried to seduce me. I am a ""sanyasi"" who has control over my senses and desires, but not all men can do that"".BJP leader Nupur Sharma said that there is no written law in India or in the Constitution that dictates how women should dress or live their lives, just like there are none for men. She also asked Omji to be more responsible with his words. Columnist Advaita Kala, another woman panelist, had a few good (sarcastic) laughs listening to Omji's regressive remarks and we can't blame her. Senior journalist and achor Rahul Kanwal gave a piece of his mind to Omji Maharaj for saying, ""stop aping western culture, I ensure there will be no rapes in India,"" saying ""then what about 6-month-old babies and 80-year-old women getting raped?""",general,3076,38,70

"Pak interim PM nominee faces ?13,000 crore corruption probe","By Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Jul 31 (PTI) The ruling PML-N partys interim prime minister nominee Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is facing a Rs 220 billion corruption inquiry by Pakistans National Accountability Bureau over an LNG contract, according to a media report. Abbasi, the former minister for petroleum and natural resources, is the principal accused in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) case registered in 2015 over the award of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import contract, Dawn News reported. Other suspects in the case include former petroleum secretary Abid Saeed, Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS) managing director Mobin Saulut, private firm Engros chief executive officer Emranul Haq and the Sui Southern Gas Companys (SSGC) ex-MD Zuhair Ahmed Siddiqui, the report said. Abbasi is expected to be elected as the new prime minister by Pakistans Parliament tomorrow, replacing ousted premier Nawaz Sharif. The Supreme Court on Friday disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the embattled leader out of office. After Sharifs disqualification, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) nominated Abbasi as its candidate for the prime ministers post for an interim period before Punjab Chief Minister and Nawazs brother Shehbaz Sharif replaces him for the remaining 10 months of the governments term. According to NAB documents, the contract for the LNG import and distribution was awarded to the Elengy Terminal, a subsidiary of Engro, in 2013 in violation of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and relevant laws. The bureau registered the case on July 29, 2015, but it is still in the inquiry stage, contrary to NAB Chairman Qamar Zaman Chaudhrys claim that he has introduced a new strategy under which the process of complaint verification, inquiry, investigation and filing of reference takes 10 months, the report said. It appears that like several cases of the Sharif family, this one has also been dumped by the NAB, it said. The case was registered on the complaint of Shahid Sattar, an energy expert and former member of the Planning Commission and the SSGC board of directors, along with others, accusing Abbasi of misusing his authority and causing a potential USD 2 billion loss to the national exchequer in 15 years. The NAB documents said that it had been recommended that the names of all accused in the case, including that of Abbasi, should be placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) and the process was ongoing, the report said.",general,2586,59,70

Delhi is preferred destination for drug smugglers: Officials,"Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport - the busiest in the country - is not only the top choice for travellers but also for drug smugglers. According to officials, Delhi airport has become the transit point of drug trade as more than 19 people have been arrested from here till date, which is almost double from last year's corresponding period.Officials claim it is an indicator that the drug market is flourishing in the city and that there are good incentives given by the drug mafia which pulls so many into this risky business.Narcotics Control Bureau's (NCB) records show that 15 people were arrested in eight cases for smuggling 18.05kg of cocaine till July this year while in 2016, only two cases were registered and 215 grams of the drug was seized. Similarly, NCB officials seized 14.44kg of methaqualone and arrested three people till July while in previous year, a total of 17 kg of narcotic substance was recovered and three were arrested.Despite constant vigil and action against drug traffickers by multiple agencies such as Customs, NCD, DRI, Immigration, CISF and the Delhi Police, the number of seizures in the city have only grown. In most of these cases, foreign nationals were involved but a recent case has left security agencies puzzled as Customs officials seized nearly 2kg of a morphine mixture from a food trolley while it was being wheeled out of an Air India flight. Officials suspect an inside job behind it but the incident exposed deeprooted nexus of drug smugglers with airport staff and officials. No arrest has been made yet. However, investigators are trying to find how the drug reached inside the plane despite having several security checks.DELHI IS THE BIGGEST CONSUMER OF DRUGS""Delhi itself is one of the biggest consumers of drugs. Its proximity with NCR towns such as Gurugram, Noida, Faridabad, where rave parties are common, also attract drug peddlers,"" said a senior security official at IGI on the condition of anonymity. He added the inflow of the drug is huge because there is a big market in the city that targets youth and students. Security agencies claim that smugglers are using innovative modus operandi and new travel routes to smuggle drugs inside the country.""Heroin is mainly smuggled into India from Pakistan. Once it reaches Delhi, it is supplied to local dealers who channel it to rave parties and individuals. Besides, the popular party drug is also shipped to European and American countries concealed in small parcels via air,"" a senior NCB official said.""Drug couriers are largely intercepted and detected at international airports. Delhi is the most connected airport from foreign countries and as it is connected with several bordering states, it further makes it easy for local peddlers to transport drugs in other parts of the country,"" a senior narcotics official said.Drugs are mainly concealed in false cavities of books, paintings, machinery parts and toys, among others. There are also professional 'swallowers' or mules who are hired and paid handsomely for cocaine trafficking by swallowing small capsules or packets of drugs or hiding them inside their private parts, the officer said. As the criminals are getting smarter, agencies are adopting various steps, including strict surveillance, enforcement at export or import points of the airport and training of drug law enforcement agencies to keep a check on new modus operandi.",world,3420,60,70
Paytm to launch own messaging service: Reports,"Leading digital payments firm Paytm plans to launch a messaging service to rival Facebook Inc?s WhatsApp by the end of August, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.SoftBank and Alibaba-backed Paytm is seeking to attract people in India to use the new messaging service embedded in its app, which many already use to buy everything from food to plane tickets.Paytm?s messaging service will allow users to send audio, video and pictures and texts, the source, who declined to be named, said.Paytm currently has more than 225 million users.Earlier this year, another home grown messaging platform Hike rolled out an in-app electronic payments service to cash in on rising digital transactions in India.E-payments in India surged after the country banned old high-value currency notes late last year.

France to require 'clean stickers' on cars in polluted areas,"French motorists in high pollution areas will be required to display a ?clean sticker? on their vehicle from January to combat pollution that has created a cloud of noxious smog in Paris and other cities.The six differently coloured Crit?Air (air criteria) stickers will be large enough for the police to see at a distance and will indicate the age of the vehicle, its engine and cleanliness on a scale of one to six.Although emergency vehicles, vintage cars and certain delivery and security vans will be exempt from the regulation, to take effect from 16 January, stickers will be obligatory for motorbikes and scooters.On weekdays, vehicles without the stickers will be banned from entering designated zones à circulation restreinte (ZCR - low-emission zones), which will be determined by local authorities based on pollution evaluations.Announcing a raft of measures to combat the increasing problem of pollution in France?s cities, the ecology minister, Ségolène Royal, said the government was ?taking the problem seriously?.?What we now need is a revolution bringing clean transport, responsible cities, electric vehicles in cities and different ways of moving around,? Royal said.The alternating traffic rule ? in which cars with odd or even registration plates are banned from cities ? was enforced for a record four days in Paris last week. It was dropped after the pollution improved over the weekend when the roads were less busy. But Airparif, which monitors air quality in the French capital, warned that the smog, which led to a rise in asthma and hospital admissions for breathing difficulties and caused schools to cancel outdoor sports, could return with the rush-hour traffic on Monday.Other measures announced include an extension of the ?superbonus scheme? in which vehicle owners can obtain a ?10,000 (£8,400) payment for changing an old polluting vehicle for an electric one. Until now this has been offered to private car owners but is to be extended to taxis and vans.From January, the government will also offer ?1,000 to those buying an electric scooter.The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, who has made fighting pollution in the city a priority, has declared she wants the capital free of diesel vehicles by 2020 and the whole of France by 2025.",world,2266,60,70
6-yr-old offers piggy bank as bribe to find mother's killers,"Manvi stands out among those present in the office of Meerut's inspector general (IG) of police, Ram Kumar. She is just six, and clasps a clay piggy bank with her tiny hands.Manvi's mother, Seema Kaushik, committed suicide this April after allegedly being harassed by her husband and in-laws. The girl had gone to the top cop's office with her maternal grandfather, Shanti Swaroop, to ""offer a bribe"" after policemen allegedly demanded money to act against those responsible for the death.""We got her (Seema) married to Sanjiv Kumar about seven years ago and soon he and his family members started harassing her mentally and physically for dowry,"" Swaroop said. ""About four years ago, she left Sanjiv's house and started living with us. However, Sanjiv and his family kept harassing her and also registered two false cases against us.

""We will look into the allegations, the case will be thoroughly investigated and the guilty will be brought to book,"" he said.Seema's brother Rohit told Mail Today that six months after his sister and Sanjiv tied the knot, the accused got a house on rent and started living there with his wife and away from his family. ""After a few months, Sanjiv's landlord called me and said that Sanjiv had locked Seema inside the house for the past few days and had gone missing. We went there and rescued Seema and since then she was living with us,"" Rohit said.A few months later, Seema's in-laws registered two police cases against her family. ""One case was of theft and burglary in which they claimed that we decamped with all the valuables and cash from their house.The other one was of attempt to murder. However, we went to court and the court quashed both the cases as they were found to be false. Since then, they were harassing my sister mentally,"" Rohit added.One day, Shanti Swaroop came home after meeting the investigating officer and told his family that the cop was asking for a bribe. ""My father is just a class IV government employee and I also got married recently. So we did not have money,"" said Rohit. ""Suddenly, Manvi walked in with her piggy bank and asked us to take her money and give it to the cops. She was ready to part with it if her mother got justice."" On the way back after meeting the IG, Manvi's piggy bank fell and broke. ""She started weeping and then I bought her another one, instructing her to collect and save more money,"" Rohit said.",general,3229,60,70

"Bihar class 12 topper missing after results, scam suspected","The results of the class 12 Bihar Board has once again stirred controversy as Humanities topper Ganesh Kumar is untraceable since the examination results were declared on Tuesday.A resident of Saraiya, Giridih in Jharkhand, Ganesh Kumar was a student of Ram Nandan Singh Jagdeep Narayan college in Samastipur, 250 kms from Giridih. Kumar went underground soon after the results were declared, triggering suspicion over him securing the top spot in the Bihar Board examination.India Today, on Wednesday, reached Samastipur and while investigating, managed to get the admission form of Ganesh, which he had submitted in the college while taking admission in 2015.

He secured 65 out of 70 in music (practical) and 18 out of 30 in theory.

Patriarchy is hard on men as well as women: Ratna Pathak,"Veteran actor Ratna Pathak Shah, who will soon be seen in the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, has said the patriarchal structure anywhere in the world is hard not just on women but on men too. A still from Lipstick Under My Burkha. (YouTube ) ?How many men have a choice? How many men are doing a job that they did not want to do, doing things and behaving in ways that they did not want to,? Ratna, who will be essaying the role of a 55-year-old widow in the film, said.?Patriarchy is hard on men as well as women. So we need to get rid of the root cause of it. Get rid of this idea of patriarchy and find new ways of looking at society,? said the acclaimed actress, who is married to Naseeruddin Shah.She questioned, ?A number of times women ask for permission from the men in their lives to do something or other. Aren?t we asking for such a behaviour then? When a woman asks for a permission from someone, yes, we are asking for it... But then you have to gauge the situation and circumstances as well. There are instances that force a woman to ask for permission. It?s not easy to do what you want to do when you are financially dependant on the other person... Within a family, since childhood you are being told that you are not really welcome, a lot of girls face it... I have faced it too. But I never got stopped due to this. When a woman wants something, she doesn?t stop,? Ratna said.Lipstick Under My Burkha, which is about four women characters, will see Ratna essaying the role of a woman whose sexual longings awaken at the age of 55.Asked if the scenes where she had to show those urges in the film, made her uncomfortable or think twice about it, she said: ?It?s not like it did not occur to me as to how a few people in my family would react to my role in the film. I did think on what my answer should be if I am questioned about my role. But now I have those answers. Because I know that there are certain topics in our lives that we don?t talk about or dodge. We don?t talk about homosexuality, generation gap... There are many issues that we rarely talk about. There are some people who are educating themselves and learning, but there are people who are still struggling on those lines. But then that is how a society works. Everyone cannot think the same. Some move forward, some lag behind,? the 60-year-old said.Talking about the men in the film, Ratna hailed the ?male gaze? on the sets. ?There is a big change in the country. There is no doubt about it. The male gaze on the set without exception was unusual... I have no second thoughts on that. I have been on a lot of film sets before, so I know what kind of vibes go around. So, this was truly unusual. And in a film like this, where there was a possibility that at some point or situation there could have been a crooked man, but no, there wasn?t a single one,? she said.The actress also said that India is in dire need of sex education. ?India is in need of sex education. We don?t know how we became a billion... ?Woh toh bas bhagwaan ki daya se hogaya?.

Two other Gujarat MLAs quit Congress to join BJP,"A day after three Congress MLAs resigned from the party and joined the BJP in a huff in poll-bound Gujarat, two more legislators switched sides and joined the saffron party today. Vasda MLA Chhana Chaudhry and Balasinor's Mansinh Chauhan are the latest Congress leaders to join BJP. They have submitted their resignations to Speaker Ramanlal Vora. Chaudhary and Chauhan are believed to be close to rebel leader and former Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela, who quit as Leader of Opposition on his birthday on July 21, alleging that there was an intra-party conspiracy to oust him from the Congress.On Thursday, Balwantsinh Rajput, MLA from Siddhpur and Chief Whip of the Congress, Tejashree Patel from Viramgam, and Vijapur legislator PI Patel had submitted their resignations to the Speaker and later went to the BJP headquarters, Kamalam, to join the party. Within minutes of joining the BJP, Balwantsinh Rajput was named the third Rajya Sabha candidate of the BJP, besides national president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani. Rajput was already rumoured to be planning to contest the Rajya Sabha election against official party nominee Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

"Pakistan providing ""safe havens"" to terrorists: US","Pakistan remained in the dock in the Trump administration?s first worldwide assessment of terrorism and related threats, released on Wednesday, for not doing enough to combat terrorist groups and individuals operating from its soil.The state department?s 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism named Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM), the two groups behind most terror attacks in India, and the Haqqani network, which has attacked US-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, as organisations that operate from Pakistan havens. In language lifted almost word-for-word from its previous iterations, the latest report said, ?Pakistan did not take sufficient action against other externally focused groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in 2016, which continued to operate, train, organise, and fundraise in Pakistan.?The report stated further, ?The Pakistani military and security forces undertook operations against groups that conducted attacks within Pakistan such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (but they) did not take substantial action against the Afghan Taliban or HQN (Haqqani network), or substantially limit their ability to threaten US interests in Afghanistan??As before, Pakistan figured on the list of countries in the report that the US says provide safe haven to terrorist groups such as Haqqani Network, LeT and JeM. ?Although LeT is banned in Pakistan,? it said, ?LeT?s wings Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FiF) were able to openly engage in fundraising, including in the capital,? it said. The report said Indian authorities continued to blame Pakistan for cross-border attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. ?In January, India experienced a terrorist attack against an Indian military facility in Pathankot, Punjab, which was blamed by authorities on JeM,? the report said. Worldwide, the Islamic State remained ?the most potent terrorist threat to global security?, the report said, ?with eight recognised branches and numerous undeclared networks operating beyond the group?s core concentration in Iraq and Syria?.And, the report added, ?Iran remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in 2016 as groups supported by Iran maintained their capability to threaten US interests and allies.? Read |?US looks to cut aid to Pakistan, other client nations in coming budgetIn terms of the number of terrorist attacks, an appendix prepared for the state department by an outside body found a dip. ?The total number of terrorist attacks in 2016 decreased by 9% and total deaths due to terrorist attacks decreased by 13%, compared to 2015. This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Yemen.?The observations on Pakistan were almost the same as observations in the country reports for 2015, for instance, reflecting a continuity from the previous Obama administration that had in August 2016 punished Pakistan for its patchy counter-terrorism by withholding $300 million in defence aid.Earlier that year, the US Senate had come together in a bipartisan effort to kill a proposal for a subsidised sale of eight new F-17 combat jets to Pakistan for exactly the same reason ? not acting resolutely enough against terrorists based on its soil.The Trump administration has already indicated its views on Pakistan?s counter-terrorism efforts are no different. National Security Adviser HR McMaster delivered that message directly to the Pakistani leadership during a visit to Islamabad in April, emphasising ?the need to confront terrorism in all its forms?.President Donald Trump has personally not weighed in on this yet, but his remarks on Twitter from 2012 may point to his thinking: ?Get it straight. Pakistan is not our friend? When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some ?ally?.?",world,3835,50,70
CBSE re-evaluation can change DU merit list: Delhi HC,"New Delhi The Delhi high court on Tuesday said the ongoing Delhi University admissions could be impacted by the Class 12 examination answer sheets submitted to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for re-evaluation this year.A bench of acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C Hari Shankar said ?the merit position of students could change substantially? on the basis of marks obtained after re-evaluation. ?Therefore, as a matter of abundant caution, colleges and admission-seeking students need to be kept informed about the pendency of the writ petition as well as the fact that the process of re-evaluation of marks by the CBSE on the request of some students is underway,? it added.Last week, the court had lifted all conditions imposed by the CBSE on students seeking to re-evaluate their Class XII answer sheets.

Admissions will be cancelled only if the student provides the university with fabricated certificates and such,? said MK Pandit, chairperson of the admissions committee.Pandit said there are provisions in the university admission guidelines to accommodate students whose grades have increased after re-evaluation. ?The guidelines clearly state that a student who qualifies under a cut-off list but fails to take admission may do so on the last day of admissions under subsequent cut-off lists, subject to the availability of seats,? he added.Pandit said college principals and students are aware of the stipulations, and clarifications have also been issued in this regard.(With inputs from A Mariyam Alavi)",general,2114,53,70

Bardalet predicted Dalí?s body would last a good while longer. ?The moustache is still there and will be for centuries,? he said.Once the last visitors of the day had left the museum, the 1.5-tonne stone slab that rests above his grave was lifted so experts could get to his body to take hair, nails and two large bones.?The biological specimens have been taken from Salvador Dalí?s remains,? Catalonia?s high court said in a statement before midnight local time.It said Dali?s coffin had been opened at 10.20pm so work could begin.To guard the artist?s posthumous privacy, awnings were put up around the museum to stop drones recording the exhumation.The DNA recovered from the remains will be compared with samples from Maria Pilar Abel, who claims to be the result of a liaison her mother had with Dalí in 1955.Abel has been seeking to prove her parentage for the past 10 years and says the physical resemblance to the surrealist painter is so strong, ?the only thing I?m missing is a moustache?.She says it was an open secret in her family that the artist was her biological father.She told the Spanish newspaper El País that she first learned of her true paternity from the woman she said she had thought was her paternal grandmother. Abel claims she told her: ?I know you aren?t my son?s daughter and that you are the daughter of a great painter, but I love you all the same.? She also noted that her granddaughter was ?odd, just like your father?.Under Spanish law, Abel would be heir to a quarter of Dalí?s fortune if the DNA supports her contention. The Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation, which controls the artist?s lucrative estate, had unsuccessfully sought to fight the exhumation by appealing against a judge?s decision late last month to let it go ahead. As Dalí bequeathed his properties and fortune to the foundation and the Spanish state, Abel has brought her claims against both.In 2007, she was granted permission to try to extract DNA from skin, hair and hair traces found clinging to Dalí?s death mask. However, the results proved inconclusive.Another attempt to find DNA was made later the same year, using material supplied by the artist?s friend and biographer Robert Descharnes. Although Abel has claimed she never received the results of the second test, Descharnes? son Nicholas told the Spanish news agency Efe in 2008 that he had learned from the doctor who conducted the tests that they were negative.Abel told the Spanish news agency Europa Press that she was looking forward ?to the truth being known once and for all?, adding: ?I?m not nervous but happy and positive.?The results of the latest DNA test are expected in a month or two. Once the samples have been tested, they will be returned to Dalí?s grave.",general,3995,58,70
"If Yogi is UP CM, Dawood can be CBI Director, tweets Shirish","Shirish Kunder is famous for going out on a limb and attracting trolls on Twitter. More or less, that is. This time around, the filmmaker invited the wrath of a certain section of Twitter for his comments on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.When Yogi Adityanath was announced as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, writer Chetan Bhagat tweeted, ""#YogiAdityanath as UP CM. Because when you make the naughtiest guy in class the class monitor, he behaves the best.""Shirish Kunder's tweets on the UP Chief Minister were probably in response to Bhagat's 'logic'.In the now-deleted tweets, Kunder wrote, ""Hoping a goon will stop rioting once he's allowed to rule is like expecting a rapist to stop raping once he's allowed to rape.""And the next tweet read, ""Going by the logic of making a goon as CM so that he behaves, Dawood can be CBI director. And Mallya - RBI Governor.""Even though Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has raised several eyebrows, Shirish Kunder's tweets were not spared.

Ayodhya issue cannot be resolved by talks: Mulayam,"Samajwadi Party founder and mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav has categorically ruled out any possibilities of resolution of Ayodhya temple issue through mutual dialogue and has demanded that the Supreme Court should decide on this issue soon.Talking to India Today, Yadav said that a court decision will be obligatory to all and will be accepted with relative ease,whereas more dialogue on this issue will only spark further tensions. He said that whatever is constructed on the site, he will lay the first brick.Answering a question, Yadav said that this issue has suddenly gained prominence again after the victory of BJP in UP and the petition filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in the apex court for an expedited hearing on the dispute. He said that contrary to what the apex court has suggested, mutual talks are not the solution to this dispute as he himself mediated in such talks four times but each time the discussion ended without a decision.He expressed his regret on the firing on Kar Sevaks in Ayodhya during his tenure and said that the Supreme Court had asked for status quo to be maintained on the site, but the mosque was demolished by Kar Sevaks.FAMILY CONFLICT Asked about his views on the current situation in the Samajwadi Party, he said that he accepted humiliation for the betterment of the party. He said that people close to him tried to bring him down, which is why the Samajwadi Party lost so miserably in UP elections. He said that one of his own family members opened a front against him whereas that person does not even have a single vote for himself.Yadav had arrived in the Mainpuri district of Agra division where he was expressing his pain to his supporters. He said that the SP lost despite so many good deeds it did in Uttar Pradesh and the primary reason for that was the internal clash in the party where people were backstabbing each other to gain prominence.He said that he felt bad, but there was nobody he could turn to in order to express his pain, so he remained silent and got humiliated. Mulayam said that the party lost because of his humiliation by his own family, as even after the Ayodhya incident, the party had not faced such a terrible defeat.Mulayam expressed his gratitude to the people of Mainpuri and said that Mainpuri was his political birthplace and this district has always supported him, elected him in the Lok Sabha with lakhs of votes. He said he has come amongst the people of Mainpuri to express his grief. He asserted that he will contest the next election in 2019 from Mainpuri as well.Aiming at BJP, he said they made the maximum laws in their tenure so far just to draw the attention of the people from the plight of the common man and farmers.He said he was not informed of the coalition between SP and Congress and when he was informed, he opposed it but Akhilesh did not pay heed to his objections. The defeat in Assembly elections was a result of that. He said that Akhilesh joined hands with the party that led three attacks on him, which indicated the level of respect he had for his father.Also read:Yogi Adityanath's first interview after taking charge of UP, says Ayodhya issue should be resolved through talks",general,3190,50,70

Trump accuses fired FBI Director of leaking classified info,"Donald Trump has accused James Comey, the former director of the FBI, of leaking classified material by passing a memo of their private conversations to the press.?James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media,? the president tweeted at 6.40am on Monday. ?That is so illegal!?The allegation, the latest phase of Trump?s war on Comey?s credibility, appeared to come in response to a report first published by the Hill which then gained extensive coverage on the conservative Fox News channel.But Comey?s defenders are likely to object that, even by the Hill?s account, not all the memos he kept were classified, and there is no proof he released one in that category.Comey told a high-profile congressional hearing last month that he had decided to keep a written record of his dealings with Trump because he thought the president ?might lie about the nature of our meeting?.He explained to the Senate intelligence committee: ?I knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened, not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the independence of our investigative function.?He also testified that, following his dismissal, he used a third party to pass to the New York Times the details of conversations with Trump, in the hope of increasing pressure to get a special counsel appointed in the Russia investigation. A special counsel was appointed the day after the resulting Times story.The Hill reported that Comey wrote seven memos ? all considered to be government documents ? about his nine conversations with Trump. Four of the memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the ?secret? or ?confidential? level, unnamed officials told the website.It added: ?This revelation raises the possibility that Comey broke his own agency?s rules and ignored the same security protocol that he publicly criticised Hillary Clinton for in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election.?The Hill article was discussed at length on Fox and Friends, a favourite show of the president?s, who duly retweeted the clip before adding his own comment.Meanwhile White House counselor Kellyanne Conway seized on the story, describing it as an ?incredible bombshell? during an appearance on Fox and Friends.Conway said: ?The boy scout, choir boy defense doesn?t hold up here because if it contains classified information, he is apparently violating, at the very least, what all FBI members sign ? they sign a document saying you will not do something like this. He was the director of the entire bureau.?The irony to me, anyway ... is that this is exactly the problem that Hillary Clinton had with her illegal server ? the handling of classified and confidential information that Jim Comey was meant to investigate, if not prosecute.? But it is far from certain that the memo the former FBI director released into the public domain was among those classified, and some critics detected an attempt to deflect attention from revelations over Donald Trump Jr?s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised damaging information about Clinton.During his appearance at the Senate intelligence committee, Comey recalled a conversation about Trump?s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and said: ?I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership.?In another exchange, Senator Mark Warner put it to him: ?I found it very interesting that in the memo that you wrote after this 14 February pull-aside, you made clear that you wrote that memo in a way that was unclassified. If you affirmatively made the decision to write a memo that was unclassified, was that because you felt at some point the facts of that meeting would have to come clean and come clear, and actually be able to be cleared in a way that could be shared with the American people??Comey replied: ?Well, I remember thinking, this is a very disturbing development, really important to our work. I need to document it and preserve it in a way, and this committee gets this but sometimes when things are classified, it tangles them up.?",general,4173,59,70

20-year-old woman raped in a car in South Delhi,"A 20-year-old woman was allegedly raped in south Delhi?s Moti Bagh by a man posing as a cabbie early Thursday, showing little had changed in the Capital four years after the brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old student shook India.The woman got into a car at 9.30pm on Wednesday and was driven around for two hours before being allegedly raped by the driver in Moti Bagh after midnight, police said. She had come to the city in search of a job, they added.She was waiting near Safdarjung Tomb for a bus to Noida when a man, identified as Avnish, pulled up in a Maruti Suzuki SX4 car with a home ministry sticker on the windscreen.He posed as a cabbie and offered to drop her home for Rs 20 ? the usual rate for shared cabs from the area to Noida -- officials said.The driver then allegedly drove her around the city -- RK Puram, Chanakyapuri, India Gate and then back to Dhaula Kuan ? and when the woman asked him about the roundabout route, he refused to answer.?She alleged that the driver took her to a secluded spot in Moti Bagh and parked the car on one side. He then locked all the doors, overpowered her and raped her inside the car,? a police officer said.The driver was arrested and reportedly confessed to the crime.In another incident, a five-year-old girl was raped allegedly by her uncle in northeast Delhi?s Dilshad Garden. The crime came to light after the girl?s family brought her to Kalawati Hospital with injuries.The cases are a bitter reminder of the night of December 16, 2012, when the physiotherapy student was brutally gang-raped by six men on a chartered bus that she had boarded after she failed to get an auto or a public bus from south Delhi?s Saket to Dwarka.The crime triggered massive protests across the country as thousands of people demanded stricter laws and police patrolling to improve a shameful record of safety for female citizens in Delhi, where a woman reports a rape every four hours.The protests caused far-reaching changes in India?s rape laws and a nationwide churning that effected sensitisation programmes in police and administration.Similar to the crime four years ago, the 20-year-old woman said she got into the cab as she was getting late and no auto rickshaw had agreed to take her for the past 1.5 hours, police said.The woman said that she fought back against the driver and managed to escape from the car. She then ran to the main road, where she saw a police bike patrolling the area and approached them, police added.?At around 1:30 am the police saw the woman who alleged that she was raped. The personnel heard her out and without losing time, called the emergency response vehicle,? an official said.Within the next 15 minutes, the patrolling bike and an emergency response vehicle started searching for the suspect?s car but he could not be located.?The woman?s statement was then recorded and her medical was conducted,? deputy commission of police, south, Ishwar Singh said. ?A case of rape was registered and a hunt to nab the driver was launched.?Investigations revealed the car belonged to Mohit Pawar, a resident of south Delhi?s Kotla and the son of a Central Industrial Security Force head constable. He told police he purchased the car a few months ago and appointed Avnish as the driver a week ago.Pawar said the MHA sticker had expired and he had put it on the car?s windshield to avoid paying toll tax.According to sources, three teams were formed to search for the car, which was found abandoned near Moti Bagh, 100 meters away from the spot where the woman was allegedly raped. The police then immediately traced the owner from the car?s registration number to Kotla Mubarakpur. Following this, the details of the driver were procured and he was traced to a slum in Dhaula Kuan.?Avnish was arrested at 5 pm on Thursday when he was drinking with his friends in Moti Bagh,? a police officer said.",general,3869,47,70
Computer method tells time according to person's body clock,"Washington, Feb 28 (PTI) Scientists have developed a novel computer method called ZeitZeiger that uses a sample of blood to accurately predict circadian time - the time of day according to a persons body clock. ""Our study demonstrates a method for predicting a persons internal time of day that could eventually be used to help diagnose and monitor circadian- and sleep-related disorders, and also to personalise treatments,"" said Jake Hughey from Vanderbilt University in the US. ""This is the first study to use genome-wide expression data from many individuals to develop a biomarker of the circadian clock in human blood,"" Hughey said. ""Previous efforts to monitor the circadian clock in human tissues were based on a small number of individuals and/or a small set of pre-selected genes. Our method, ZeitZeiger, uses 15 genes from across the human genome to predict circadian time,"" he said. The researchers were surprised to find that 13 out of these 15 genes were not core genes of the human circadian clock. Core genes are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. They can be compared to the gears of a mechanical watch. ""Most of the genes that were selected for ZeitZeiger seem to be outputs of the clock; that is they are not the gears controlling the clock, but the hands telling the time. ""This shows that when given data for almost every gene in the genome, the algorithm can figure out which set of genes gives the best predictions, even if they are not core clock genes,"" Hughey said. In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight. Circadian dysfunction is linked to conditions such as cancer, depressive disorder and obesity. Knowledge of an individuals circadian rhythms could be used to optimise the timing of therapeutic interventions, which is known as chronotherapy.",general,2175,59,70

Drug peddlers coat eatables with LSD to avoid detection,"Believe it or not, eatables laced with LSD are the emerging modus operandi followed by drug peddlers across the country, agencies dealing against narcotics claimed. Be it biscuits or nut crackers, drug peddlers are lacing them with LSD and selling them at higher price.The revelation came days after Task Force sleuths arrested nine people, including two Nigerians, in two separate cases at Masab Tank and Banjara Hills in Hyderabad. Along with 300 grams of cocaine, 42 grams of MDMA and three biscuits laced with LSD were recovered.According to sources, during interrogation, they told police that to save themselves from being caught at the airport, they started coating LSD on eatables such as biscuits and nut crackers. They further told police that this is not the first time they have laced eatables with LSD. ""Most of the drugs, especially LSD, coming from Germany to India are being coated on eatables,"" they reportedly confessed.LSD LACED EATABLESThe officers said that earlier LSD-laced sugar cubes were seized, but this is the first time drugs in biscuits were found. ""These biscuits were detected and seized only because the peddlers were carrying another drug as well, which was detected in the scanning machine,"" an officer involved in the investigation said.After recording the confessional statement, the inputs were shared with the narcotics department. Also, security agencies at the airports, including CISF, have been alerted about the new modus operandiSpeaking to Mail Today, a senior officer of the narcotics department said, ""It is very difficult to identify adultered eatables and eatables laced with LSD. But officers scanning passengers' luggage at the airport have been asked to keep tight vigil on eatables in their bags. Not only this, but they have been advised to check biscuits or nut crackers if they are in small quantity.""Sources also said peddlers - mostly from African countries - have been carrying small consignments which they hide between the clothes or in false cavities in their bags.""They also carry nut cracker packets in their hand bags to avoid suspicion. They keep the seal open and tend to eat some of them to fool security officers. Those arrested hid the eatables laced with LSD in a small false cavity inside the packet to fool the officers,"" a source said, quoting one of the confessional statements.Meanwhile, preliminary interrogation and analysis of cell phone data of the peddlers revealed they might have sold drugs to more than 100 people in the last one and half years.""Most buyers are young, especially college students,"" said an officer in the Task Force.

The murder was discovered after their landlord Anil Kumar came to meet Taiyab and found the door ajar. When he went inside to check if Taiyab was around, he saw Shabnam lying dead on her bed. He then made a PCR call and informed the police.?We received a call from a neighbour who told us that a man had murdered his wife. The police team reached the spot and rushed her to the hospital where she was declared brought dead. The woman had strangulation marks on her neck and some bruises on the face that suggests that she was thrashed before she was killed.

"Have waited patiently, will do what is required: Sasikala","""We have waited patiently till now.

Also Read: Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Huge blow to Chinamma as minister Pandiarajan joins OPS campAn enraged Sasikala openly stated that the delay caused by the Governor seems deliberate and hinted that as time goes by, her grip over the herded MLAs was slipping. But the way she framed the words to say that ""will do what is required"", it ended up more like a threat to the Governor who still hasn't called her to form the Government and less of a claim. Giving out this statement, Sasikala initiated an emergency trip to the resort where the MLAs are 'kept' accompanied by her remaining Generals, Sengottaiyan and Edapadi K Palanisamy. THE POWER PARADEInitially, she wished to go to Marina to pray at the Jayalalithaa Memorial before leaving to meet the MLAs. But the trip was cancelled as cadres and Sasikala followers could not turn up at the Memorial in such a short time. Jayalalithaa's 'Land Cruiser Prada' carrying Sasikala took a different turn and left for 'Kuvathur', 83.08 km from the city to 'Golden Bay Resort', the private resort where 95 MLAs are currently herded together. Sasikala reached around 4pm and the 'meeting' began. The initial plan was to take the MLAs from the resort and to parade them in front of the Governor to prove her strength. Sasikala waited at the resort along with the MLAs patiently to acquire the Governor's appointment. ""We initiated the talks about meeting the Governor but people around Sasikala are not giving her the right advice. They did the same mistake they had done with her coronation attempt. They fix everything and then inform Governor Vidhyasagar Rao doesn't act that way and she is not Jayalalitha,"" explained a top government official. Around 6.30pm Sengottaiyan, the most important General of AIADMK came out to inform that media is falsely stating that his name is on the card for the CM post. ""Our only candidate for the post of chief minister is Chinnamma,"" he clarified. ""We have given a letter to the Governor and we will wait till tomorrow evening,"" he said explaining that the Governor has refused to meet Sasikala for the day. THE BLACKOUTSources close to the MLAs alleged that AIADMK MLAs are not happy staying inside a resort as many were not prepared for such a vacation. Also, there is a blackout of media inside the resort meaning they don't know what is going on in the world, which is why many have started to panic as well.Around 7.30pm, Sasikala left Golden Bay resort holding a 'Poker face' as any leak of expression would favour the opposite camp. Reaching Poes Garden, she met the press and assured that everything is fine with the MLAs and that they are her family and that they are together. Also Read: Sasikala losing against Panneerselvam?

"Mumbai family plants 5,500 saplings over 17 years","For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. They have so far planted 5,500 saplings. Last year, they started a butterfly garden near Aarey dairy, and it is already buzzing with 15-20 species of butterflies. There are 86 species in Aarey, according to researchers.Sandeep Athalye, 37, his wife Vardayeeni, their four-year-old son Malhar and mother Aarti have been carrying the baton passed onto them by his father Vinay, who passed away in 2015. ?It all started with my father in 2000. He began planting trees with support from a club of walkers. People joined the group and helped him. My father would tell me that nature has its startling beauty and presents us with many gifts. It is our duty to return the favour,? said Sandeep. The senior Athalye first planted 100 sapling at unit 16 in Aarey. They were protected by the walkers? club. Over the next 15 years, he planted more than 3,500 saplings at Panchavati, New Zealand hostel, VIP guest house, Gaondevi Road and MHADA Road. ?At Panchavati, my father planted about 550 saplings from 2004 onwards. We took care of them and today, it is a dense forest with 75 varieties of trees. The focus should not just be on planting trees. Trees should be taken care of for at least next three to four years. That is how you take care of your children too, don?t you?? said Sandeep.After his father?s death, Sandeep, his wife and his mother took up the initiative to plant 2,000 saplings in Aarey. The butterfly garden was their recent initiative. ?The garden has 700 trees now with 70 nectar plant species, including Jamaican spike, lemon, jathropha, pentas, exoras and many other species. These are mostly plants that will attract the butterflies and help with their life cycle,? he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects. Apart from a car depot and stabling lines for a Metro line, three plots have been marked for Metro VII. The green lung faces threat as the state is considering to change the land use from no-development zone to green zone, to pave way for more constructions and lastly several encroachments that have been cropping in different parts of the 3,166 acres of land. Residents of Aarey lauded the family?s efforts. ?The saplings planted 17 years ago have borne fruits today and the area is home to one of the largest biodiversity sites at Aarey,? said Biju Augustine, an Aarey resident. ?While the Panchvati land is now under Force 1 Security Services, the area is a forest thanks to the Athalyes. We need more people like them to protect the last green lungs of the city.?Over the years, the Athalyes were joined by many nature lovers and NGOs. ?Initially, we bought our own saplings and planted them, but after a while we began receiving donations and saplings from different groups that joined us on weekends,? said Sandeep adding, ?We never wanted publicity. The moment you seek publicity, the cause is bound to get buried.? The Athalyes plan to continue their efforts to conserve it. ?Aarey?s biodiversity is magical. The next generation needs to realise its value and why it?s necessary to double the number of plantations for every project. Development cannot come at the cost of the environment,? he said.",general,3486,49,70
The rules of the Censor Board need to be revisited: Anupam,"Anupam Kher is known to have voiced his opinions on a series of issues, from the Kashmir unrest to demonetisation. Call it a ""political opinion,"" and he corrects you - ""It's my national opinion. My opinions are about my country. They are not representative of any political ideology. It's a very cliched thing to call any opinion about the country a political opinion.""Many people believe that actors should stay away from talking about anything unrelated to films. In fact, if an actor has an opinion, especially one that is not popular, they get trolled. Kher tells IndiaToday.in, in an exclusive interview, ""Acting is a part of my life, it's not my life. I'm an individual; I'm a citizen of this country, I'm a teacher, I'm a motivational speaker, I'm a writer, I'm a son. Just because everyone may not agree with me, doesn't mean I'll stop putting forth what I want to say. In life, you cannot make everyone happy. And you don't necessarily stop talking to those who don't agree with you. You have to, as a celebrity, learn the art of ignoring. Yes, of course, you get upset and unhappy sometimes. But it's alright, I have been in this business for a long time.""While B-Towners from Shah Rukh Khan to Aamir Khan had expressed their concern that India was becoming increasingly intolerant, Anupam Kher had begged to differ. But when Sanjay Leela Bhansali is thrashed and his Padmavati sets are attacked for allegedly distorting the glorious Rajput history, does it not smack of intolerance? The actor says that ""it is very unfortunate,"" but not does think intolerance is the reason.""I think the media gives it great importance. The problem is that if a bunch of 10 people doing something like this gets nationally covered, then they know that this is how they will get noticed... But on a level of what they have done, it's absolutely not right. It should not have happened. Nobody can dictate what should be made and what should not be made,"" he emphasises.Anupam Kher, who was the censor chief from 2003-04, also said that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) rules need to be revisited. ""The rules were written in 1952. The present government had appointed a committee headed by Shyam Benegal. I don't know what happened to the recommendations. They need to be implemented. Rules toh ban jaate hai, unko implement nahi kiya jaata,"" the actor said.Anupam Kher will be seen next in Naam Shabana, which is scheduled to release on March 31.

Maha issues draft rules to regularise illegal constructions,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Maharashtra government has set the ball rolling to regularise lakhs of unauthorised buildings and structures in cities across the state, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, on the payment of a compounding fee.The state urban development department, which chief minister Devendra Fadnavis heads, on Friday issued draft rules to regularise unauthorised construction till December 31, 2015. The department has invited suggestions and objections on the rules in a month. Lakhs of illegal structures or unauthorised buildings, largely residential ones including those like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli, now stand to benefit from this policy. A senior urban development official said, ?We have formulated the rules mainly keeping residential structures in mind. Within six months of the rules coming into force, planning authorities will have to invite applications from owners and occupiers for consideration of cases for regularisation. The local authority will specify the time and date for the submission of such cases, after which applications will not be considered. The authority will then take a call on the cases as per the rules.?The official said even a case like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli stands to benefit if they have purchased the required Floor Space Index (FSI). FSI refers to the ratio of the built-up area to the plot area and indicates the permissible construction limit. The seven buildings in the Campa Cola compound have 35 floors more than what was approved by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), prompting the civic body to send a demolition notice leading to a long protracted legal battle.To pave the way for the regularisation of such structures, the state government passed a bill to amend the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act in the budget session of the legislature in April this year. The move will bring relief to lakhs of citizens in such buildings in places such as Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Navi Mumbai and Pimpri Chinchwad. However, it is also likely to set a precedent and open the decks for further condoning of illegal construction in the future.According to the draft rules, the state?s policy will apply to most cases of unauthorised construction, except for structures in ecologically sensitive zones, Coastal Regulation Zones, land meant for playgrounds or parks, heritage buildings and structurally unsafe buildings, among others.For cases of FSI violations, such as Campa Cola, the draft rules state such construction can be considered for regularisation by procuring premium or fungible FSI, or Transfer of Development Rights, as per applicable norms. Owners or occupants of such structures will have to pay compounding charges at 10 percent of land rate over and above the premium for the extra FSI.Similarly, the draft rules will also allow regularising construction where the structure is taller than the maximum height allowed as per the width of the road it abuts. While local authorities will have to explore the option of road widening in such cases, the state?s draft rules allow them to consider regularisation of the unauthorised construction by levying a compounding fee of 10 percent of the ready reckoner rates.The draft rules also provide for compounding fees for regularisation in case of inadequate setback area, violations in ground coverage, parking, staircase, passage width and misuse of any such free of FSI components. Moreover, building owner or occupants will need to procure the required no-objection certificates from departments such as drainage, water supply, fire, structural stability certificates and so on before regularisation.Once a civic body declares a structure as a compounded structure for regularisation, no further development will be allowed on the plot besides regular maintenance and repairs or redevelopment as per norms.The state government has instructed civic bodies to keep aside all the money collected as compounding fees under these rules for providing public amenities, utilities and services in the respective areas.Read more:Lakhs of illegal structures across Maharashtra to be regularised after penalties",general,4199,59,70
Kulbhushan bigger terrorist than Kasab: Pervez Musharraf,"Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on Friday said that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a bigger terrorist than Ajmal Kasab, one of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which more than 150 people were killed. Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April this year on charges of espionage. Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and is responsible for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, the troubled Pakistani region where Islamabad has long accused RAW of promoting terrorism.In an interview to Pakistan's ARY News, Musharraf drew parallels between Jadhav and Kasab, who was hanged to death in India for his role in the Mumbai attacks. Musharraf said Kasab was just a ""pawn"" while Jadhav is responsible for getting ""dozens of people"" to carry out terrorist activities. ""Who is a bigger culprit (between Jadhav and Kasab),"" Musharraf rhetorically asked, before saying, ""Obviously it is Jadhav."" ""I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for,"" Musharraf added.The former Pakistani army chief also slammed his country for appearing in the International Court of Justice, which this week put a stay on Jadhav's death sentence. ""It was wrong that India went to the ICJ,"" Musharraf said, adding, ""Pakistan should not have gone (to the ICJ"". Issues of espionage and sabotage are Pakistan's internal matters, Musharraf added, saying no one has the authority to advise his country on these issues. He also went on to indicate that world bodies like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice don't have any real power. Directives issued by these world bodies are ignored by some countries, Musharraf said when asked whether Pakistan could have realistically avoided sending a team to the ICJ to defend against India's claim. Musharraf went on to cite the example of the United States executing two German nationals in 1999 despite an ICJ provisional ruling putting a stay on the death penalty awarded to the two. THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV ISSUE In April this year, Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence handed to Kulbhushan Jadhav, accused of spying.India, which slammed Jadhav's trial as 'farcical', said that Jadhav is not a spy and that he is a former Indian Navy officer-turned businessman who was kidnapped in Iran and taken to Pakistan. Contending that Islamabad had violated the Vienna Convention by not providing New Delhi consular access to Jadhav, India filed a petition at The Hague, Netherlands-based ICJ. This week, the World Court, allowing India's plea, asked Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until the ICJ has had the time to hear the matter in full and arrive at a final verdict.ALSO READ: How Pakistani media reported ICJ stay on Kulbhushan Jadhav's death sentence",general,2836,56,70

B'luru firm agrees to give cab service to females after stir,"On June 14, Manisha Kumari - an employee of IDC Technologies - told India Today that her office had denied cab facility to female employees working in the night shift.Manisha works as a technical recruiter in the IDC Technologies. She was aghast at the apathy of her company, which put safety of women employees at huge risk when they returned home late night from work. This was going for close to two months.India Today raised the matter with the IDC Technologies management as well as with the IT Minister of Karnataka Priyank Kharge, who promised to look into the matter. Priyank Kharge said the government would take action if Manisha filed a complaint as the act of IDC Technologies was in clear violation of the rules.IDC Technologies is a multinational company with operating centres in the US, Canada, Mexico and India.UNDER PRESSURE, IT FIRM PROMISES TO ABIDE BY RULESAs India Today raised the issue and exposed the IT firm for its blatant violation of the rules, the IDC Technologies felt pressure and decided to resume the cab facilities for female employees working in the night shift.The IT firm told India Today that they did not have cab facilities for their night shift female employees for about two months due to an issue with the cab vendor.Now, the matter has been resolved and all female employees working in the night shift will get a drop in till their home as per the existing rules.Praveen Kumar from the HR department of IDC Technologies told India Today that the company was now in compliance with Labour and IT laws of the state. ""Necessary action has been taken to make sure (that) all female employees working in the night shift are provided with pick-up and drop facilities. Employee satisfaction is our main motto and female employee safety is our prime concern,"" Praveen Kumar added. The company has now deployed six cabs that pick and drop their female employees working in the night shift.HOW MANISHA FOUGHT FOR HER RIGHTThough the IDC Technologies maintains that the cab problem was there for only two months, Manisha told India Today that the issue has been dragging for nearly two years.She told India Today that the night shift earlier started at 6.30 pm and continued till 3.30 am when the employees would log out and leave for home. But, in the absence of cab facility, it became quite unsafe for female employees, Manisha said.After some of the employees complained of being harassed in those hours while they went back home, the timings were changed to 7.30 pm to 4.30 am. But, this did not solve the safety problem, said Manisha, who recounted three incidents of harassment on the way back home since she joined the IT firm in February.""Once I was harassed by a cab driver near the Silk Board Junction who misbehaved with me when I was leaving work and another time by two bike borne men. The third incident involved a passerby,"" Manisha said.

How has India's performance been in ICC Champions Trophy?,"India have had pretty mixed fortunes at the ICC Champions Trophy. India have played the tournament in all the previous seven editions finishing on top twice while ending runners-up once.Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and most lately Shikhar Dhawan have been key to India's rise at the multi-nation tournament. Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma have been the among the top wicket-takers at the event while MS Dhoni is the most successful Indian wicket-keeper. This time they will go into the tournament as defending champions and would look to create history by becoming the first team to win the championship thrice.Here's a look at India's journey at the top ICC event:1998 Wills International Cups (Bangladesh) - SEMI-FINALSIndia fielded a strong side with Mohammad Azharuddin as captain. The side boasted of a strong batting line-up with the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh in the side. Javagal Srinath spearheading the pace attack while Anil Kumble looked after the spin department.However,India were knocked out in semi-finals by West Indies, who were led by Brian Lara.2000 ICC KnockOut (Kenya) - RUNNERS-UPSourav Ganguly's 117 went in vain in the big final as Chris Cairns' 102 not out guided New Zealand to a four-wicket win to hand Kiwis the trophy. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan made their debuts for India in the tournament.2002 ICC Champions Tropy (Sri Lanka) - CHAMPIONS (Shared)India, under Sourav Ganguly, went a step further by becoming the joint champions with Sri Lanka after the final was rained-off twice. In the final, Sri Lanka posted 244/5 with Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a fifty each. In reply, India started off well and were 14/0 in two overs when rain halted the proceedings and no further play was possible that day.On the reserve day, Sri Lanka again won the toss and batted first. This time Mahela Jayawardene and Russell Arnold struck fifties to help Sri Lanka post 222/7 in their 50 overs. In response, Virender Sehwag looked at his menacing best with 25 not out off 22 balls when heavy rain stopped play. Once again the persistent rain denied a result and the trophy was awarded to both Sri Lanka and India.2004 ICC Champions Trophy (England) - GROUP STAGEIndia failed to go beyond the group stage. India started off their campaign with a thunderous 98-run win over Kenya but a three-wicket defeat against Pakistan was enough to stop Ganguly's men from advancing to the semi-finals.2006 ICC Champions Trophy (India) - GROUP STAGEIndia's batting line-up failed to fire in the big tournament at home. They managed to beat England in their first game but their star-studded batting continued to misfire and consecutive defeats against West Indies and Australia left them with just one win in the tournament.2009 ICC Champions Trophy (South Africa) - GROUP STAGEIndia again failed to impress. Rahul Dravid-led side started with a 54-run loss against Pakistan while their next game against Australia yielded no result because of rain. In their third group match, India beat West Indies to finish with three points in the table but it was not enough to get them through to the semi-finals.",general,3217,57,70
Sleep with me if you want your husband freed: Cop to woman,"The Jodhpur police arrested a man with 1kg opium last week. The man's wife has been running pillar to post to get her husband out of the jail. She was offered help by a cop but he wanted a deal.Sitting behind bars, Rajiv Gandhi police station incharge Kamaldan Charan must be cursing himself for his depraved behavior. The cop was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for taking money from a woman whose husband was held in connection with drug trafficking. Kamaldan Charan had far more sinister plans other than just making some quick money. INDECENT PROPOSALCharan arrested a man in possession of 1kg opium last week. The wife of the accused approached the cop asking him for help to get her husband out of jail.The pervert cop agreed to help her but for that she would have to agree for a deal. The woman was shocked to hear what Charan wanted in return of release of her husband.Apart from Rs 2 lakh, the policeman wanted the woman to sleep with him. The woman somehow managed Rs 1 lakh and gave it to Kamaldan Charan. She also gave him a cheque of Rs 1 lakh as guarantee. But the Charan insisted on cash. When the woman expressed her inability in providing him with the money, the 'predator' cop asked her to 'compromise' if she wanted her man to be free.Charan told the woman that he will come at her house in night to 'enjoy' and spend some time with her. Stunned by what she heard, the woman immediately approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). After verifying the facts, ACB sleuths laid a trap to nab Kamaldan Charan red handed. HOW THE PERVERT COP WAS ARRESTEDCharan told the woman he would visit her on Tuesday night when is out on patrolling duty. The ACB was informed about this. He reached the woman's house on time and bolted the doors from inside. Before he could proceed according to his plan, the door bell rang. Charan's game was over.

Raveena Tandon's 'Maatr' hits the theatres,"Director: Ashtar Sayed Cast: Raveena Tandon, Madhur Mittal, Divya Jagdale, Anurag Arora, Rushad RanaRating: (1.5/5) Not Without My Daughter, Taken, The Brave One are just some of the Hollywood thrillers that come to mind when sitting through Maatr, a revenge drama, in which a traumatised mother takes the law into her own hands and tracks down the killers. But writer Michael Pellico throws in Indian references to in the Mahabharata and the brutal gangrape which is reminiscent of the Nirbhaya case. For all its grittiness, Maatr is barely able to skim the surface of a woman's paranoia unlike Pink, another drama about sexual assault which is set in the capital.Raveena Tandon plays Vidya, a teacher, who witnesses her bright daughter's brutal rape and subsequent demise. She is a bruised, battered victim herself but the makers pretty much sideline Vidya's trauma to focus on her grief. Here too one of the perpetrators is a man with influence, in this case it's the bratty son (Madhur Mittal of Slumdog Millionaire) of the Chief Minister. This is one of the earlier signs that in Maatr playing out extremities is more important than allowing moments of reflection and empathy. When justice is out of her reach (""it's not like filter coffee that you get it instantly""), Vidya with a little help of Facebook, Google Maps, email, drugs and a gun plots the death of the seven accused. While some are well-executed, most are a bit sudden and haphazard. The latter makes the film occasionally germane and at times improbable. Tandon does well as the more amateurish Liam Neeson but one wishes for more context to her character instead of just a well-coiffed, vengeful, death magnet of a mother. Little time is devoted to her doomed marriage with an inconsiderate husband who blames her poor navigation skills for the tragedy. As the sole witness of the murder and survivor she is also surprisingly given too much free reign to execute her plan. Another minor sexual assault victim is included to heighten the anger, but in Maatr this seems more a lazy plot convenience. As the clock approaches the hour mark, Sayed raises the violence quotient adding kicks and punches to the action but the blows don't quite have the emotional impact. Maatr despite the gravity of the theme is a subpar drama. The film would have been more effective if the mawkish, flashback-heavy songs were skipped. Maatr is a missed opportunity to make a powerful statement against India's poor track record in dispensing justice and tackling violence against women. Revenge is a dish best served cold; in Maatr it's crass and oddly flat too.",entertainment,2614,42,70

Noida authority to repaint road marks to regulate traffic,"The Noida authority has decided to paint road marks with an aim to streamline traffic movement on city roads. The decision comes after the Noida authority?s traffic cell found out that 80% of road markings in the city are either washed away or fade out on their own. Road markings are used as a means of controlling and guiding traffic. ?We are likely to start painting road marks from July 15. We have already completed the procedures required for taking up such a project. Once the road and lane marks are in place, they will help the traffic police in regulating the flow of traffic,? Sandip Chandra, head of the Noida authority?s traffic cell, said. The project involves marking of zebra crossings, left-right turns, stop lines for vehicles and designated spaces for pedestrians, who often face problems negotiating traffic without adequate markings on roads. The traffic police recently installed close circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at intersections in Sector 57/22 and Sector 2/19 for better traffic management. ?The traffic police is keen to have CCTVs installed at other intersections too. But we need to have proper road markings before we start penalising motorists caught violating traffic norms. Once the markings are done, we will issuing challans (fines) to violators,? Layak Singh, traffic inspector, Noida traffic police, said. There are 112 traffic signals in Noida and the traffic police has 278 personnel at its disposal to regulate the movement of vehicles.The traffic police wants to make use of CCTVs to impose penalty on motorists violating traffic norms. Most of the busy intersections and roads remain congested during peak hours traffic in the morning and evening, inconveniencing thousands of commuters. The Noida authority and the traffic police have, of late, been struggling to ensure smooth flow of traffic in busy thoroughfares. ?Whenever the traffic police writes to us for support on traffic management, we provide them the facilities required. We hope to finish the road marking work very soon in order to enable the traffic police to penalise violators,? Chandra said.",general,2113,57,70
"Used to get scared of online rape, acid attack threats: Dia","Actor Dia Mirza, who was in Delhi to walk for designer Anju Modi at the India Couture Week 2017, has not just a lovely face but also a strong mind. And that is something Twitter trolls couldn?t digest. In this era of non-stop trolling, Dia recalls how, in her early days in Bollywood, she was targeted for expressing her opinion on various issues. In recent times, Dia?s tweets have advocated water conservation on Holi and a noise-free Diwali. ?In the earlier days, when I did get trolled, it really affected and frightened me. Because when you?re told that people want to throw acid on you, or they want to rape you, or kill you, or call you anti-national because of something that you?ve said... and they ask you to move to another country... and it?s all new to you, then it really alarms you,? she says. The 35-year-old actor was trolled on social media when she had tweeted and urged her fans to play a dry Holi. She had written: ?The irony of the times we live in: farmers commit suicide due to drought and people waste water to ?play? #Holi. Go ahead call me anti-Hindu.? The trolls were quick to tag her as anti-national. Dia was also called intolerant when she had tweeted about wanting a cracker-free Diwali. Now, after so many years in Bollywood, Dia takes such crude reactions in her stride. The actor states that she has always voiced her opinion on issues that deeply matter to her. ?I have continued to express my opinion. I reserve my opinion for things that truly matter to me. And when you express your opinion on something that deeply matters to you, it doesn?t matter how people construe it,? she says. ?I feel that those elements on social media who are faceless and nameless, who make it their business to harass people, [don?t] need to be taken seriously. I?ve been in the public sphere long enough now to understand that we need to be like ducks and let this [trolling] be like water sliding off our backs. The only thing that matters is our own truth. The intent is what should matter,? adds the actor. Dia will be seen next in the Sanjay Dutt biopic by Rajkumar Hirani; she plays the role of Maanyata, Dutt?s wife. Speaking about her film and working with Hirani ? he is the director of such blockbusters as Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006), 3 Idiots (2009), and PK (2014) ? Dia says, ?Rajkumar Hirani is my favourite director. (Dia worked with Hirani in Lage Raho Munnabhai, starring Sanjay Dutt as Munnabhai.) It was an absolute pleasure to be asked by him to be a part of Sanjay Dutt?s biopic. [Hirani] is one of those real people who tells stories in the most unique and honest way.

Nirbhaya rape convicts on 'suicide watch' after SC verdict,"Presently lodged in Tihar jail, the four men sentenced to death in the December 16 gang rape and murder case, will be kept under strict suicide watch again. One of the accused, Ram Singh, hanged himself in prison on March 11, 2013, within three months of his arrest. Jail officials said that the wardens in the respective jails where they are lodged have been told to stay vigilant and report any abnormality in the behaviour of the four. Though the Supreme Court ordered death for the four convicts, the mother of the 23-year-old paramedic had told Hindustan Times that it is difficult for her to accept that one of the convicts (juvenile) is a free man. ?He was released because he was a child but what that boy did to my girl is not a child?s act. I can never forgive him,? she told HT on Thursday.The Supreme Court on Friday ordered that all four convicts in the gang-rape and murder case of a 23-year-old paramedic student be sent to the gallows.While pronouncing the verdict the court observed that the incident ?is a tsunami of shock in the minds of the collective destroyed humanity?.?The devilish manner in which the accused played with the victim is diabolical,? the court said.The convicts had been awarded death by a fast-track court on September 13, 2013, which was later upheld by the Delhi high court.Speaking to the Hindustan Times on Friday, the victim?s mother had demanded that her daughter?s rapists and killers be hanged to death. ??The court must sentence them to death.

"N Korean elite turning against Kim Jong-un, says defector","North Korea?s elite is outwardly expressing its discontent towards Kim Jong-un and his government as more outside information trickles into the isolated nation, the country?s former deputy ambassador to London has said. Thae Yong-ho defected to South Korea in August last year and since December has been speaking to media and appearing on television to discuss his defection and his life as a North Korean envoy. ?When Kim Jong-un first came to power, I was hopeful that he would make reasonable and rational decisions to save North Korea from poverty, but I soon fell into despair watching him purging officials for no proper reasons,? Thae said during his first news conference with foreign media on Wednesday.?Low-level dissent or criticism of the regime, until recently unthinkable, is becoming more frequent,? said Thae, who spoke in fluent, British-accented English. ?We have to spray gasoline on North Korea, and let the North Korean people set fire to it.? Thae, 54, has said publicly that dissatisfaction with Kim prompted him to flee his post. Two university-age sons and his wife defected with him.North and South Korea are technically still at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The north, which is subject to UN sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes, regularly threatens to destroy the south and its main ally, the US. Thae is the most senior official to have fled North Korea and entered public life in the south since the 1997 defection of Hwang Jang-yop, the brains behind the North?s governing ideology, Juche, which combines Marxism and extreme nationalism. The modern North Korean system had ?nothing to do with true communism?, Thae said, adding that the elite had watched with unease as countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and the former Soviet Union embraced economic and social reforms. Thae has said more North Korean diplomats are waiting in Europe to defect to South Korea. North Korea still outwardly professes to maintain a Soviet-style command economy, but for years a thriving network of informal markets and person-to-person trading has become the main source of food and money for ordinary people. Fully embracing these reforms would end Kim Jong-un?s rule, Thae said. Asked if Kim?s brother, Kim Jong-chol, could run the country, Thae was sceptical. ?Kim Jong-chol has no interest in politics. He is only interested in music,? Thae said. ?He?s only interested in Eric Clapton. If he was a normal man, I?m sure he?d be a very good professional guitarist.?",world,2533,57,70
Delhi Police to install HD video cameras in PCR vans,"Delhi Police are going digital to improve the quality of investigation. The police control room (PCR) department has decided to procure high-definition (HD) video cameras (handycams) and keep them in 1,000 PCR vans that are the first responders to any crime scene. The handycams would be used by the in-charge of patrol vans to record the crime scene, gathering of people, and areas around the spot, apart from recording statements of the witnesses, all in digital format. This video recording will be handed over to the investigating officer, who can use it as digital evidence in the court. ?The objective of the initiative is to get first-hand evidence of any crime and use it to make the case stronger against the accused,? said a senior police officer.In the current scenario, the officer said, evidence collection is the investigating officer?s job and the officer takes the help of forensic experts to lift samples. A lot of evidence and witnesses are lost or gone from the crime scene because the forensic experts and investigators generally reach late, mostly after some key witnesses leave the spot. ?But as our PCR vans act as first responders to any crime and reach the spot first, sometimes in less than a minute or two, it will be easy for us to capture such key evidence using the video cameras,? the officer said. ?There have been instances where suspects were present at the crime scene after the crime, monitoring the police activities and probe. Video recordings of the spots can help us identify and prosecute them based on the video footage.?Another police official said that the video cameras can be used for multi-tasking. Apart from crime spots, patrol van officials can use video cameras during demonstrations, riots, processions and other public gatherings, which at times witness violence as protestors resort to stone pelting on public servants and damaging private and public property. The recordings of such gatherings can be used by the police at a later stage to nail the trouble mongers. At present, as many as 500 patrol vans are equipped with ?phablets? that are used as call receiver and navigator. Since these phablets have in-built cameras, they can be used for video recordings too. ?The idea is to train our patrol van staff in making videos of crime scene... We cannot use video recordings of the phablets as digital evidence because the quality of video they produce is not good,? added the officer.PCR vans and control roomAverage calls received everyday by the police control room: 25,000 to 28,000Actionable calls: Around 8,000Number of patrol vans: 1,000Number of police personnel posted in patrol vans: 6,000",general,2655,52,70

I felt angry after watching Lipstick Under My Burkha: Ekta,"New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) Producer Ekta Kapoor has said she came up with a ""sassy promo"" for ""Lipstick Under My Burkha"" as she wanted the film to reach out to wider audiences rather than being confined to the art film zone. The movie hit a roadblock with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) soon after Ekta came onboard as a distributor but it only strengthened her desire to take the movie to the masses. ""The film made me angry. I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. Here was this entertaining movie that spoke about what I think. Why didnt I think of it? I loved it,"" Ekta, 42, told PTI in an interview. She came onboard the project when it had already hit a roadblock. Jha called her to watch the film and asked whether she would like to distribute and she immediately agreed. ""I decided to distribute this movie knowing that I might not earn profits. Then I was hoping we would get a certificate and thats when it landed into a soup with the censor board."" The board was criticised for being regressive by refusing certification to Lipstick... as the film was ""lady- oriented"". The makers approached the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), which directed the CBFC to certify the film with few cuts. After the film was cleared for release, Ektas team came up with an edgy poster of the film, which depicts a woman showing her middle finger. ""I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it? So, we got a sassy promo out, edgy as hell with great Hindi masala music and have more women pay attention to it. I felt this was the way to go forward."" As someone who has produced shows on TV before venturing into cinema, Ekta understands the duality of the audiences in India. ""Hamare khaane ke daant aur, dikhane ke daant aur hain. What I say in front of my parents, I wont repeat the same with my friends. And we are okay with it. ""This is our society, this is how weve been brought up.

"Islamic State on the run, will soon be wiped out: Trump","President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the Islamic State was ?on the run? and will soon be ?wiped out? of Syria and Iraq, days after the Iraqi forces with the help of the US-led international coalition re-took Mosul from the terror group.Iraq has declared victory over the IS in Mosul, retaking full control of the country?s second-largest city three years after it was seized by the terror group.?ISIS is on the run and will soon be wiped out of Syria and Iraq, illegal border crossings are way down (75 per cent) and MS 13 (Mara Salvatrucha) gangs are being removed,? Trump tweeted.The US President had on Tuesday spoken with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and congratulated him on ?the liberation of Mosul? by Iraqi security forces.He said that the development marked a major milestone in the fight against ISIS.?The President praised the heroism of the Iraqi and American soldiers and underscored his commitment to the total defeat of ISIS,? the White House said in a statement.?He stressed the need to consolidate gains to prevent ISIS or any other terrorist group from returning to liberated areas,? it said.ISIS is on the run & will soon be wiped out of Syria & Iraq, illegal border crossings are way down (75%) & MS 13 gangs are being removed.? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017Commander of US forces in Iraq Lt Gen Stephen Townsend told Pentagon reporters that the IS has lost its capital in Iraq and the largest population centre they held anywhere in the world.?Iraqi militia forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and the global coalition also deserve a share of the credit for their sacrifices to achieve this hard-won victory,? he said.?Make no mistake, this victory alone does not eliminate ISIS, and there?s still tough fighting ahead. There are still pockets of resistance in Mosul, hold-outs, and hidden IEDs that will take weeks to clear, as well as remaining ISIS enclaves in Hawija and western Anbar,? Townsend said.There are also humanitarian and stabilisation efforts desperately needed to ease the suffering of Mosul citizens and start the city on the road to recovery, he said.Though the Moslawis have suffered greatly, the east side is already springing back to life less than six months after its liberation. And Moslawis have already started to return to their neighbourhoods in the west.?But still, the loss of one of the twin capitals and a jewel of their so-called caliphate is a decisive blow to ISIS and certainly something for the Iraqis to celebrate. They can also celebrate the remarkable turnaround their security forces have made in the course of the past three years,? Townsend said.However, he said that there was still no news about the IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.?There?s been a lot of media interest in the whereabouts and status of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Despite all the helpful reports to us from every source imaginable, I?m unable to confirm or deny where he is or whether he is alive or dead. Let me just say for the record, my fervent hope is it is the latter,? he said.IS is an evil enemy who will resort to any lengths to maintain their hold on the territory they claim as their caliphate, Townsend said.?But make no mistake, it is a losing cause. Our partners in the international coalition against ISIS will stand side by side against ISIS until they?re defeated in both Iraq and Syria,? Townsend asserted.",world,3400,55,70

North East neglected for decades: Rajnath Singh,"Itanagar, Feb 20 (PTI) Development of the North East is essential for the countrys economic development, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said today while criticising the previous UPA regime at the Centre for neglecting the region for years. Singh, who was addressing a function to mark the 31st Arunachal Pradesh statehood day, called the North East a ""holy place"" and one of the richest in the country. ""But no one had taken care of it even after several decades since Independence,"" he said. ""In 2001, the NDA government under Prime Minister A B Vajpayee created the Ministry of Department of North Eastern Region as an independent one. After this, the region got a momentum in terms of development,"" he told the gathering. ""And now Prime Minister Narendra Modi had rechristened the Look East Policy as Act East Policy to fast track development in the region after years of negligence,"" he said. The senior BJP leader said the Centre was keen on development of Arunachal Pradesh which is ""strategically located sharing international borders with China, Bhutan and Myanmar"", and assured full support to the state for its all round development. Referring to the border dispute between India and China, Singh said the relations between the Asian giants had improved and they were involved in bilateral trade worth USD 70 billion. Singh, who was accompanied by Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju and BJP national secretary Ram Madhab, said, ""Arunachal Pradesh is in its full youthfulness and interestingly the Chief Minister is also the youngest in the country.

Narendra Modi world's most important PM: Israeli newspaper,"By Harinder Mishra Jerusalem, Jun 27 (PTI) ""Wake up: the most important PM of the world is coming"", is how Prime Minister Narendra Modis forthcoming visit to Israel, the first by an Indian premier, is described in an article in one of the leading Israeli business daily. Business daily The Marker in a feature story in its Hebrew edition discussing Indo-Israel ties says that Israelis had set up huge expectations from US President Donald Trumps visit to the Jewish state but ""he didnt say much"" while Modi, a leader of 1.25 billion people enjoying massive popularity and representing one of the fastest growing economies of the world deserves a lot of attention. Other local newspapers and news portals have also given a lot of attention to the much-publicised three day trip of Modi with The Jerusalem Post even creating a separate link, ""Modis Visit"", where it has put up stories related to India. Most of the local commentators have emphasised on Modi ""skipping Ramallah"" and it being a standalone visit focussing only on Indias ties with Israel. ""Unlike most world leaders, however, Modi, who governs the worlds largest democracy and second largest nation, apparently is refusing to visit Ramallah during his Israel trip, and will not schedule meetings with Palestinian Authority (PA) chief Mahmoud Abbas or other PA leaders"", Arutz Sheva said in a report. Modi met Abbas during the PA leaders trip to India in May, and senior Indian officials have visited Abbas at his Ramallah residence during their trips to Israel, it added. India related activities in Israel have also attracted far more attention in view of Modis visit than ever before. International Yoga Day celebrations in Israel saw massive coverage by the Israeli media with some commentators talking about the ""soft diplomatic power it arms New Delhi with"". Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed his Indian counterparts visit to Israel last Sunday during his opening remarks at the weekly cabinet meeting as a ""very significant step"" in strengthening bilateral relations that are on a ""constant upswing"". ""Next week, the Indian Prime Minister, my friend, Narendra Modi will arrive in Israel. This is a historic visit to Israel. In the 70 years of the countrys existence, no Indian Prime Minister has ever visited and this is further expression of the state of Israels military, economic and diplomatic strength,"" Netanyahu stressed. ""This is a very significant step in strengthening relations between the two countries,"" he added. India is a huge country with over 1.25 billion people and is one of the worlds largest, growing economies. Ties between Israel and India are on a ""constant upswing"", the Israeli Premier said. Modis three day visit starting July 4 is aimed at commemorating 25 years of establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries. The Indian prime minister is scheduled to have dinner with Netanyahu following his arrival to Israel on July 4. He would be meeting the Israeli Premier again for discussions the following day. Modi would also call upon Israels President Reuven Rivlin on July 5 and the leader of opposition, Isaac Herzog. Around 4,000 people of Indian origin would be attending an address by Modi in the evening of July 5 in Tel Aviv. The Israeli cabinet on Sunday approved major decisions to deepen Indo-Israel ties. Among the measures proposed include the establishment of a USD 40 million joint fund to encourage Israeli and Indian business cooperation, agreements permitting and extending incentives to Bollywood filmmakers looking to shoot in Israel, efforts to promote growth in tourism, and a joint government project in the fields of water and agriculture. Netanyahu and Modi have already met twice on foreign soil on the sidelines of UN-related events and are said to be constantly in touch with each other over the phone.

"Government denies any plan to build wall between India, Pak","Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) told Parliament that there was no proposal with the Central government to build a wall along Pakistan border. This was stated by Minister of State (MoS) for Home Kiren Rijiju in a response to an unstarred question by Rajya Sabha MP Harivansh.Internationally, ""the wall"" is a term often used by United States President Donald Trump while referring to the physical barrier his government aims to build along the border with Mexico. According to reports, after Home Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to Israel, the MHA was planning to build a ""strong wall"" along the India-Pakistan border to check terrorist infiltration. It was learnt that the Ministry of Home Affairs was keen to build a wall similar to the Israeli West Bank wall with Palestine. However, the Home Ministry informed the upper house that the Narendra Modi government is not considering any such proposal. HI-TECH PLANS TO BOOST SECURITY The government instead has adopted a multi-pronged approach for enhancing security arrangement at the India-Pakistan border. This includes deployment of Border Security Force (BSF), construction of border fence and border roads, installation of floodlights and construction of border outposts (BOPs), introduction of hi-tech surveillance equipment and providing weapons and specialised vehicles to security forces.In another statement, MHA informed Parliament that approximately 250 km of India-Pakistan border has not been covered under fencing primarily due to riverines, ditches and marshy terrain, and in some cases due to pending land acquisition.The MHA said India has sanctioned a pilot project for deployment of technological solutions and force multipliers, physical patrolling, laying of concertina wires, laser infra-red system, among several other measures along the border.

10-yr-old accidentally discovers 1.2 million-year-old fossil,"A 10-year boy has accidentally discovered a rare, mostly intact 1.2 million year-old skull of stegomastodon - a prehistoric ancestor of elephants - while hiking in the Las Cruces desert in the US.?I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,? said Jude Sparks, who had been hiking in the desert with his parents.?My face landed next to the bottom jaw. I looked farther up and there was another tusk,? said Sparks.The Sparks family contacted Peter Houde, a professor at the New Mexico State University (NMSU) in the US.?A stegomastodon would look to any of us like an elephant,? said Houde.?For the several types of elephants that we have in the area, this is probably one of the more common of them. But they?re still very rare. This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico,? he said.After the family contacted Houde, the jaw and two pieces of tusk were taken to the Vertebrate Museum at NMSU.In May, the family joined a team of scientists who worked for about a week to carefully unearth the skull.Houde estimates the jaw weighs about 120 pounds and the entire skull as little as a tonne. While the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate.?The upper part of the skull is deceiving. It?s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin,? Houde said.?An extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn?t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses,? he said.?That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it,? he added.During the weeklong extraction process, 10 to 12 people helped at different times with the excavation of the stegomastodon skull.Researchers painstakingly brushed away the last bits of dirt from the skull and tusk and applied chemical hardeners to ensure the ancient bones remained intact.Acting like plastics, the chemicals harden and restore the strength that would otherwise be present in the bone as protein.After the skull was unearthed, the team carefully coated the fossil with plaster and placed wood braces to protect and support it.The skull was lifted from the dig site by a front-end loader and placed on a flatbed truck for the trip back to the university.While the process to study and reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks will take years to complete, Houde said that the stegomastodon fossil will eventually go on display.",world,2411,60,70

BJP leader calls Mamata 'Babur' for renaming Centre's scheme,"The Didi vs Modi battle has gone a notch higher with the Mamata Banerjee government changing the names of the Central government schemes in West Bengal. The Trinamool Congress has been a vocal critic of the BJP government at the Centre, and has lashed out at the Centre for its decision to demonetise high-value currency in November last year.The Mamata Banerjee government wants to drop the 'Pradhan Mantri' from the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and instead wants to call it 'Banglar Gramin Sadak Yojana'.Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Grameen is now 'Banglar Griha Prakalpa'.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) will be known in West Bengal as 'Mission Nirmal Bangla'. Hitting out at the Mamata government for renaming schemes, BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose compared the West Bengal chief minister to Babur who ""demolished a temple in Ayodhya and built Babri Masjid"".STATE IS BEARING THE COST TOOThe reason for renaming schemes: The Mamata Banerjee government said that the state has to now bear 40 per cent of the total cost of implementing the schemes as against 10 per cent previously. According to the West Bengal government, if the state has to pay more than 40 per cent of the total cost then why should the Central government get the credit, especially when the state is providing the machinery and agency for the implementation of the scheme. P Ulagnathan, district magistrate of Cooch Behar confirmed that he has received the orders and said he would ""implement"" them. Pushpita Roy Dakua, who is the sabhadipati of Cooch Behar zila parishad, said the work on changing the names of schemes on boards and banners is on at war-footing.

Privacy doesn't have status of fundamental right: Govt to SC,"Arguing in the right to privacy case before the nine-judge Constitution bench in Supreme Court today, Attorney General K K Venugopal said that privacy does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right. ""Privacy is part of Right to Life under Article 21, but does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right,"" said AG Venugopal on behalf of the Centre. The debate on privacy as a fundamental right is a part of the larger debate on Aadhaar and if the scheme violates one's right to privacy.The Centre has earlier said that petitions challenging the validity of Aadhaar over violation of privacy cannot be entertained under Article 21. ATTORNEY GENERAL MOUNTS DEFENCEArguing for the Centre, AG Venugopal said that framers of the Constitution intentionally omitted mention of privacy as a fundamental right. There are several aspects to Right to Life such as right to food, shelter and employment but everything does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right, said K K Venugopal in the Supreme Court today. The Attorney General said that there is no absolute Right to Life and deprivation of the right in certain instances is in-built in the Constitution. He said that while life and liberty are qualified rights under the Constitution but their every aspect is not a fundamental right and it cannot be elevated to that status. Petitioners want privacy on a whole to be declared as a fundamental right but it will have grave consequences, argued Attorney General Venugopal. He said that a World Bank report has identified Aadhaar as a great scheme for developing countries.THREE STATES SUPPORT PETITIONERSKapil Sibal, appearing for the states Karnataka, West Bengal and Puducherry, told the nine-judge bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar that the states support the petitioners on the argument that privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Kapil Sibal said that while privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution of America and Australia but it is a fundamental right. WHAT HAVE THE PETITIONED SAIDSenior counsel Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court last Wednesday that the Preamble to the Constitution intrinsically guarantees the right. He said that liberty, which is fundamental to a democracy, cannot exist without privacy.Senior counsel Arvind Datar argued that right to privacy flows from Article 14 (Right to Equality), Article 19 (Freedom of Expression) and Article 21 (Right to Life). Arguing for privacy as a fundamental right, Dattar said that the court must not strictly lay the right to privacy under a single article. Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee , appearing in support of privacy right, said that even if the Constitution did not ""explicitly"" provide this right, it could be deduced as had been done in the case of freedom of press.WHAT HAS THE COURT SAID SO FARWhile hearing the petitioners, the Supreme Court observed that right to privacy cannot be absolute and the state may have powers to put reasonable curbs. The nine-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar, comprises Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Abhay Manohar Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer. ""We live in an age of big data and the state is entitled to regulate the data whether it is for the purpose of regulating crime, taxation or other activities... Right to privacy cannot be so absolute that it prevents the state from legislating or regulating it,"" the Constitution bench said.The Supreme Court also observed that ignorance of citizens on how personal data furnished by them was being used could not be the basis for not testing the validity of a law, in this case the Aadhaar Act.(With inputs from Anusha Soni and agencies) ALSO READ:Aadhaar vs WhatsApp: How privacy changes meaning for government in different cases",general,3836,60,70
India don't play Pakistan team as they are scared: PCB head,"Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan has said India are scared of playing Pakistan after losing the Champions Trophy final at The Oval on June 18. India and Pakistan have not played bilateral cricket since 2012 when the latter travelled across the border for a short limited-overs tour. That was the only series between the arch-rivals since the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai.However, the two countries have continued to play at ICC events with India enjoying a clear upper-hand. Pakistan, though, stunned India with some spirited cricket in the final of the Champions Trophy. Pakpassion.com reported that Shaharyar, the outgoing PCB chief, felt India continue to refuse to play bilateral cricket with Pakistan because ""they are scared of our team.""""After our win, we challenge India to come and play bilateral cricket with us. They don't play us, they are scared of our team.

Can IIT withhold result: SC on student expelled for harassment,"The Supreme Court has said it will examine whether an IIT can withhold the results of a final-year student, who was terminated after being held guilty in a sexual harassment case.A bench of justices SA Bobde and L Nageswara Rao issued notice to the Centre and IIT Kanpur on the plea of the student, who challenged the Allahabad High Court order dismissing his plea.Advocate Manu Shanker Mishra, appearing for the petitioner, said the results of the final semester should be given to the student as the delay is jeopardising his career.The petitioner, before being terminated, was a final-year student of Department of Physics after being admitted to the institute in July 2012.He was expelled from the institute in April 2016 after he was found guilty of sexually harassing a girl student.The 23-year-old BSc Physics girl student had accused her senior of sexually harassing her for two years after which the college administration had forwarded the matter to the Women?s Cell. The cell found the accused guilty and he was expelled later.He claimed that the Women?s Cell never gave the copy of the complaint made by the girl to him and did not even consider his reply.?The charges levelled against the petitioner were absolutely vague and were incapable of being replied properly. However, the petitioner gave replies to all the charges and he also tried to support his defence by introducing a large number of documents and a list of students who would appear as witnesses in the inquiry in support of his defence,? he said.The student claimed that the findings of the Internal Complaint?s Committee were also not made available to him by the Women?s Cell.He said that the report of the Women?s Cell together with the minutes of the meeting of the Senate Students? Affairs Committee of March 30, 2016 were placed before the Academic Senate for its consideration on April 5, 2016 and were ratified and he was terminated.?The Academic Senate did not give a copy of the report to the petitioner and it also did not give him any show-cause notice asking him to appear before the Senate for hearing.?No opportunity of hearing of any kind whatsoever was afforded to the petitioner either by the Senate Students? Affairs Committee or by the Academic Senate before the aforesaid decision of terminating the academic programme of the petitioner was taken by them,? he said.The student claimed that his defence was not considered at all by the authorities at any stage of the proceedings and ?there was sufficient material supplied by the petitioner so as to demonstrate that the complaint that was made against him by the female student was malicious?.He said that single judge bench of the Allahabad High Court had ordered that the petitioner will submit a written unconditional apology before the institution and had directed the IIT to declare the petitioner?s result, if he has passed the examination.IIT Kanpur, however, challenged the order of the single- judge bench which the division bench on February 3, set aside.",general,3016,62,70
India probably worst place to do business in: Cellular body,"New Delhi, Aug 2 (PTI) Mobile industry body Indian Cellular Association (ICA) today criticised the business climate in India saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. ""Ease of doing business...there are very few countries we can compete with, obviously from the bottom. Probably, this is the worst country to do business in. That is a very frank statement I want to make,"" ICA National President Pankaj Mohindroo said at an event organised by IAMAI. He said that IGCR (Import of goods at concessional rate of duty for manufacture of excisable goods) processes are very cumbersome in the country. ""There is no trust between customs authorities and taxation authorities. Most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard is that there is target given for revenue collection,"" Mohindroo said. He said that lack of ease of doing business is very upsetting to the industry. Industry players raised concerns over huge capital getting blocked in bank guarantees given as assurance to customs that the items imported by them on concessional duty rates will not be retailed in the market and will be used solely for making mobile phones. As per data available in April, it is estimated that bank guarantees to the tune of Rs 29,000 crore have been furnished by companies. Ajay Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and IT who was present at the event, countered Mohindroos claim saying that there has been continuous improvement when it comes to doing business in India. ""India has jumped up several position in global indices released on ease of doing business. Now, government gives 30 clearances in one day on e-biz portal for which people were required to approach similar number of offices. Ease of doing business is a continuous improvement process and India is on right track,"" Kumar said. The Fast Track Task Force, a joint government and industry body, has an objective to achieve production target of 500 million mobile phones by 2019 and generate employment for 15 lakh by 2019. Mohindroo, who heads the task force, said the target can be achieved only if India is able to match competitors like China and Vietnam. ""China today is around 82 per cent of global manufacturing, which means it produces 20 lakh mobile phones per year. We are very elated that (mobile production) in India has reached Rs 90,000 crore, Vietnam is already at 3 lakh crore. We have to match them in terms of direct taxes what Vietnam and China are able to give,"" Mohindroo said. He said that direct tax in China in special cases is around 10 per cent while in Vietnam it is nearly zero. Mohindroo said exports will play key role to achieve the target set by 500 million mobile phones production in India. ""Pakistan does not permit Indian mobile phones to enter Pakistan, which is closest biggest market, and we have given most favoured nation to Pakistan. This is not fair. I think Commerce Ministry has to take a lot of lead in this. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, also dont give us any credits,"" he said.",business,3055,59,70

UK's top paid CEO's payout plunges by ?185 crore in a year,"Sir Martin Sorrell received £48m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors.Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPP?s annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of £48.1m in 2016.The figure is 31.6% lower than the £70.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last year?s AGM. The payout, the last to be awarded under WPP?s controversial ?Leap? scheme, means Sorrell has received about £210m in total remuneration since 2012.WPP has introduced a less generous arrangement for Sorrell, which is expected to pay out £19m a year. It will be the subject of a binding vote at the company?s annual meeting in June.However, WPP said on Friday that it intended to tighten the policy further with a potential payout band of £14.9m to £19.2m maximum this year. From 2018, that will fall to between £18m and £13m as dividend equivalent payments are scrapped.The company has moved to stem further potential run-ins with investors at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the Brexit vote and the warning from Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. WPP?s chairman, Robert Quarta, appointed at last year?s annual meeting, also said planning to identify the successor to Sorrell, 72, had intensified.?Our succession planning process, which has always been rigorous, has become even more focused and detailed over the past year,? said Quarta, in WPP?s annual report published on Friday. ?Whether it happens in the near or distant future, when Sir Martin leaves his role as chief executive, we will have an exceptional team of potential candidates on the bench.?Sorrell shows no signs of slowing down, having celebrated the birth of another child on the day of the US presidential election last year. He has no plans to step aside and said, on the question of succession, that there is ?nothing to see here?. His pay has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012, during what became known as the shareholder spring, nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual package for the previous year. Last year, Sorrell defended his remuneration, arguing that he had put three decades of his life into turning WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a global marketing business worth £22bn.?I?m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],? he said. ?If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years ? I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.?The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent ?Sorrellcentricity? at the company.Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over.?As part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings,? he said. ?This exercise gives me greater confidence than ever in the strength of our people and their potential to succeed at the very top.?This internal pool is, of course, maintained alongside a constantly refined list of external candidates.?Quarta said internal candidates include those who report directly to Sorrell, as well as ?many who currently occupy the senior tier below?.",business,3818,58,70

Bollywood was never my dream: Pakistani actress Sajal Ali,"Pakistani actor Sajal Aly, who played a rape survivor in her Bollywood debut Mom, says she had never dreamed of acting in the Indian film industry. Speaking about her role as Arya in the Sridevi-starrer, Sajal said, ?It was definitely a challenging role... I mean any character you play, you have to really commit to it and kind of naturally become like that, at least that?s how I function. I think the most challenging part was performing with Sridevi ma?am. Like my very first scene in the movie is me sitting at a dining table across from her and misbehaving with her -- it was terrifying,? Dawn quoted her as saying on Wednesday.?We had to shoot in Georgia and it was freezing cold... So yeah, that was pretty tough too,? Sajal said.Sajal said, ?Bollywood was never my dream, in all honesty. I was happy working here and that was not something I was working towards but this story moved me. I always knew that if I worked in Bollywood, I have certain limitations and boundaries that I would not want to cross and this movie was about a sensitive topic, everything was handled so tastefully.?The actor is all praise for her co-star Sridevi, who plays her mother in the movie. ?She?s just the sweetest person. Even now, she keeps calling me and reminding me that I?m in her thoughts.?Sajal said she had three film contracts with Boney Kapoor, Sridevi?s husband and a producer in Bollywood. ?But now I don?t know what?s in the near future.

My father and I have a crush on Tabu: Ayushmann Khurrana,"Ayushmann Khurrana, who will be next seen in Meri Pyaari Bindu opposite Parineeti Chopra, talks about his his role in the film, his journey in Bollywood and his upcoming projects. How did Meri Pyaari Bindu come to you?I had read this script three years back. That time Yash Raj Films was not producing it. I was very excited about it. Back then they were looking for a girl for the part and couldn't find one. Suddenly, Adi Sir [Aditya Chopra] called to say that there is this script called Side B Love. That was its title then. I knew I loved it. It was so novel and nostalgic. Suprotim [Sengupta] expresses beautifully with his words. You play a pulp fiction writer. Have you read any? That writing is not my zone. I am not a fan. In Meri Pyaari Bindu, I'm a Hindi writer. There are some raunchy titles like Awara Dhoban and Chudail ki Choli. I imagine Bindu in every character. The film thrives on nostalgia, and nostalgia never gets dated right? Yes. It just gets better. But this is not all about the past. It's a life journey of these characters from 5 to 35. It is also set in current time.Bindu and Abhimanyu make a mix-tape. Have you made a mix-tape for somebody?Of course. For myself and my first girlfriend who went on to become my wife. I made her a 90-minute Hindi English mix. There was no graph. It was random. There was a Kishore Kumar ""Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas"" and then suddenly Bryan Adams' ""Best of Me"".Your brother Aparshakti Khurana has also taken to films. Is there a rivalry now?There could be no rivalry because there is so much of love. I am a protective brother. He respects me a lot. Though there is a difference of three years, he touches my feet. He does it in front of everybody deliberately. And I'm like Ghar pe kar le, but he will do it even at award shows. He has been doing so since childhood so he suddenly won't change his ways. We look similar but we are so different. I was a co-curricular captain of the school. He was the captain of the sports team. He has captained the Haryana under-19 cricket team. He is one of thode rare Punjabis who can speak fluent Haryanvi too which is why he fit so well in Dangal too. Your career graph is defined by playing the loveable fool in romantic comedies such as Vicky Donor, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Meri Pyaari Bindu. But you are now turning things around by working with Sriram Raghavan. Tell us about it.I think you need time for everything. You have to establish yourself as a guy next door, and then do something radical later. If you try something radical with every film, then you will get exhausted. You are limited some way or the other even if you are multi-talented. Though a lot of thrillers were being offered to me, I wanted a Sriram Raghavan thriller. He is the master of thrillers. This is the perfect time for that metamorphosis. This is the most challenging role of my life.And you are working with Tabu.Oh My God, she is stunning. My father and I both have a crush on her. I start shooting it in June. Then there's Shubh Mangal Savdhan, a remake of a Tamil film, with Bhumi Pednekar.It is the antithesis of Vicky Donor. I play a guy who has erectile dysfunction. The filmmaker, RS Prasanna, calls it a spiritual remake of the original. It came out in 2012 and was seen as the Vicky Donor of south even though the topics are different. Shubh Mangal Savdhan is radical, quirky and a family film despite the topic.Are you happy with the movie offers coming your way?I am fortunate that I have been a part of two National Award-winning films in five years. I am getting good choices being part of boutique management of Yash Raj where they handle a fixed number of actors. I am pretty content. Would you want to try action, a genre that heroes want to have in their filmography?I started with an unconventional film and I am unconventional in a way. I want to just own that space. I want to be myself. If everybody aspires to be a conventional, commercial hero, who will become the Amol Palekar and Farooq Sheikh of this generation?",general,4021,56,70
"Mulayam campaigns for Shivpal, seeks votes for Lok Dal","The spring may have gone out of Mulayam Singh Yadav's step after he was unseated from the leadership of the Samajwadi Party by his son Akhilesh Yadav, but he still retains his ability to sting. Evidence of that came at the rally that he addressed this afternoon at Jaswantnagar in his home district of Etwah. He came here asking for votes for his brother Shivpal Yadav but what was more interesting was his open support for a Lok Dal candidate from the Etwah seat.Mulayam rooting for the Lok Dal candidate is significant. The party exists mainly on paper and is distinct from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is headed by Ajit Singh. After Mulayam Singh Yadav was tossed out as the president of his party, he, along with Shivpal, toyed with the idea of taking over the Lok Dal, but ultimately decided against it.Speculation abounds in political circles that close to 40 of the duo's loyalists who were denied tickets by the SP are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket. If a handful of them manage to win, they could strengthen Mulayam's hand in the event of a hung Assembly.Also read: Samajwadi feud: Mulayam-Akhilesh fight leaves Shivpal supporters in limboYADAV CLAN ABSENT AT SHIVPAL RALLYAlthough Etwah happens to be the family bastion of the Yadav family, not one member of the larger Yadav clan has been out seeking votes for Shivpal. Conspicuous by their absence from today's rally were the chief minister and MPs Ram Gopal Yadav, Dimple Yadav, Dharmendar Yyadav, Tej Pratap Yadav and Akshay Yadav.A significant feature of Shivpal's campaign and today's rally was that votes were sought in the name of Mulayam Singh Yadav and the development work that has taken place in the district during his time as chief minister and by Shivpal as the state irrigation and PWD minister. No mention was made of Akhilesh Yadav or any of that development work done by his government.",general,1872,54,70
Raabta is not a copy of Telugu film Magadheera: Producers,"Ever since the trailer of Raabta released, fans couldn't help but draw comparisons between Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon-starrer and the 2009 Telugu film Magadheera. And now a day after the makers of Magadheera approached the Hyderabad court to seek injunction against the release of Raabta, its makers have come in defense of their film. Magadheera was a love story set in different time zones. And the makers of the Telugu film have alleged that Raabta has plagiarised the core of Magadheera. However, the producers of Raabta have denied the plagiarism allegation and said in an official statement, ""We would like to, however, categorically reject even the remotest of suggestions that our film is a copy of Magadheera. We find it extremely unsavoury and disrespectful when people from the industry belittle someone's hard work by using words like ""copied"", ""plagiarised"" nonchalantly and jump to conclusions merely on the basis of a 2 minute and 14 second trailer, without verifying the facts or waiting for the film to release for the public to give its verdict."" The statement further read, ""'No one can claim copyright in ideas and plot' has been the very essence of copyright law in India for decades."" The makers of Raabta added that its is an original film that presents their version of a timeless love story.Official Statement on behalf of the producers of #Raabta, Dinesh Vijan and Bhushan Kumar pic.twitter.com/ueU87TUIuv The Hyderabad court will hear the case on June 1 to decide the release of Raabta, which is slated to hit the screens on June 9.

Woman makes man give to charity for calling her 'available',"""When can I meet you? What is your ""rate""? ""Will Rs 3,000 do? Shall I book a hotel room?"" These were the questions fired at Sreelakshmi Satheesh, CEO of an educational consultancy firm in Kerala and a motivational speaker, when she attended a call from an unknown number. Since then, her phone rang a number of times, all unknown numbers. When she chose not to attend the calls, text messages poured in, asking for her ""rate"". It soon escalated to a state where she had to switch her mobile phone off. The ""rate"" had by then reached Rs 25,000. Sreelakshmi was shocked, but only for an hour. Then she decided to act. She turned her phone on, dialed one of the numbers from which she had gotten a call earlier and spoke to the fellow who answered with nauseating enthusiasm. He shuddered when Sreelakshmi told him about her profile and soon began begging for forgiveness. It wasn't a tough task for her to figure out how this fellow got her phone number. He shared the screenshot of the conversation in a Whatsapp group where a man posted her number referring to her as a ""super item"". Learning that the man who posted her number on the group was an acquaintance, someone who used to wear the mask of a decent man whenever they interact, and most of all, the regional secretary of the youth wing of a national party, Sreelakshmi decided to act, to file a police case.Party workers, who realised Sreelakshmi is going to the cops, began calling her, apologised, and pleaded with her to settle the matter outside the court. She had only one demand -- the man should be expelled from the party -- and as proof, she asked for the party meeting minutes where the decision is taken. Sreelakshmi was to receive the party minutes by 8 PM yesterday, but did not. She decided to file an FIR. When the man's father, an old man, went to meet Sreelakshmi to beg for forgiveness and to request her not to file an official complaint, she thought of an alternate way. Sreelakshmi asked the old man to tell his son to donate Rs 25,000 to any charitable organisation and produce the bill as proof.The fellow did so, and produced the receipt as proof. Unable to control her anger, Sreelakshmi narrated the entire episode in a Facebook post, and the post soon went viral with over 1,317 shares, 1.200 comments and 4,500 likes. In the comments, many Facebook users lauded Sreelakshmi for teaching the ""future leader"" a lesson he would never forget, but as always, there were many who questioned the authenticity of the whole incident. There are also many girls, and other women, sharing similar personal experiences in the comments, and asking Sreelakshmi for help and guidance on how to tackle the issue of online harassment and blackmailing.",general,2723,59,70

I just showed him the trailer and asked if he would do the voice-over and he readily obliged. I can?t thank him enough,? Shreyas said.?I had heard that the Marathi film was a big hit.

Army gets powers to buy weapons for 'short intense wars',"As the stand-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers continue at the Doklam plateau in Sikkim and the borders with Pakistan remains hot, India has quietly authorised the Indian Army to make emergency purchases of ammunition, stores, spares for several weapon platform worth thousands of crore so that the army is ready for a ""short intense war"", top sources told India Today.Typically, the Indian military is required to be ready to fight a short intense war that could last between 10 to 15 days.An internal audit of the Indian Army conducted after Uri brigade headquarters were stormed by terrorists last year that left 19 soldiers dead had revealed huge shortfall in critical shortfall of artillery ammunition, tanks shells, fuses and spares for weapons platforms.In retaliation to the terror attack, special forces of the Indian Army, aided by the Indian Air Force, had crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and destroyed terror launch pads and Pakistan Army facilities.An unknown number of terrorists waiting to cross over were killed in the raid.The army identified 46 kinds of ammunition, spares for 10 weapons platforms like infantry combat vehicles and half-a-dozen mines of various kinds as critical for war fighting. These items can be purchased through the emergency purchase route.NO CAP ON SPENDING The executive order authorising the Vice Chief of Indian Army to make emergency purchases was issued recently. The delegation of financial powers shortens the long winded process and red-tape plagued process of procurement.""Unlike previous process, there is no per-determined cap on the amount that can be spent. Rather, the limit to spending has been tied to the minimum stores, ammunition that must be in the reserve of the army at given time. This is big shift,"" a senior Ministry of Defence officer said.After the internal audit of the Indian Army carried out by the office of the Master General Ordnance (MGO) revealed major gaps, the army was authorised to make emergency purchases till March 31, 2017 to plug the gaps.These powers - to make emergency purchases bypassing the laid out process - now have been extended till further notice.Earlier, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) too had highlighted severe shortfall of ammunition and spares. In a report placed before the Parliament in 2015, the CAG had observed: ""while availability of authorised stock against War Wastage Reserve (WWR) to meet the expected duration of operation formed the basic criteria for ensuring the operational readiness of the Army, we found during the review that against the WWR of 40 (I) days, the availability of ammunition was only in 10 per cent of the total types of ammunition held (March 2013).""It went on to note that ""the acute shortage was a serious cause of concern directly impairing the operational readiness of the Army.""Also read:Doklam standoff: China tells Arun Jaitley it is also different from 1962Should India be tackling China first than Pakistan? 1971 war army veteran explainsLoC firing and Doklam: Chinese strategic expert says India unwise to engage in two conflictsChina warns India of serious consequences if it doesn't withdraw troops from Doklam area",general,3191,56,70
Italy may face water rationing due to prolonged drought,"Scarce rain and chronically leaky aqueducts have combined to put Romans at risk of drastic water rationing as soon as this week.Sky TG24 TV meteorologists noted on Sunday that Italy had experienced one of its driest springs in some 60 years and that some parts of the country had seen rainfall totals 80% below normal. Among the hardest-hit regions was Sardinia, which is seeking natural disaster status.Farmers? lobby Coldiretti last week estimated ?2bn ($2.3bn) worth of damage had been done to Italian agriculture so far. Dairy farmers are lamenting drops in milk production. Among those suffering are farmers growing canning tomatoes in the southeastern region of Puglia, wine grapes throughout much of Italy and those cultivating olives ? all signature crops for the nation.Another afflicted area was the province in Parma, an area in north-central Italy renowned for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and prized prosciutto.Rome?s water supply worries have turned political. Last week, the governor of Lazio region, which includes the Italian capital, ordered that no more water be drawn from Lake Bracciano, which supplies some of the Italian capital, because the drastically decreasing water level posed danger to the aquatic life of the lake.The lake, 40km from Rome, used to be used only for backup water supply but recent years have seen it being tapped on a regular basis.Rome water company ACEA warned that without the lake, drastic rationing loomed. Italian media said staggered water supply shutdowns could last as long as eight hours daily in alternating neighbourhoods and start as soon as Wednesday. Rome?s famed fountains risk being turned off.The move put populist 5-Star Movement Mayor Virginia Raggi under pressure, since the city of Rome is a major shareholder in Acea. Michele Meta, a Democratic party lawmaker from Rome, demanded to know why Acea ?doesn?t have other solutions besides rationing and staggering the capital?s water? supply?Rome had 26 rainy days in this year?s first six months, compared to 88 in the first half of 2016, with precipitation totals in those same periods more than four times higher last year than this year.But water supply pipelines in the Rome area ? famed in ancient Roman times for its aqueducts, segments of which still stand ? are notoriously leaky.La Stampa daily reported on Sunday that water, energy and environment companies lobby Utilitalia analysed companies serving roughly half of Italy?s population and concluded that the water loss rate from inadequate infrastructure, often decades-old, ranged from 26% in the north to 46% in the central and southern parts of the country.",world,2636,55,70

Meat sellers in UP protest against action on slaughterhouses,"Meat items are flying off the menu from a majority of eateries in Uttar Pradesh as a host of illegal abattoirs have been forced to shut shop under the Yogi Adityanath government.The Muslim-dominated western parts, adjoining the national Capital, are among the worst affected, a reality check by MAIL TODAY found.While the debilitated meat supply highlights the fact that erstwhile governments in UP had turned a blind eye to unlawful slaughterhouses, it also proves the incumbent government had no consolidated plan to avoid a crisis-like situation. ""I have not seen such scarcity of raw meat in the last 35 years that we have been in business,"" said Mohamad Khalid, owner of Al-Nafis dhaba at Dasna on NH 24. ""The last 10 days have been harrowing. This is worse than the demonetisation phase,"" said Khalid, the second generation owner of the popular dhaba serving highway frequenters.RS 4,000 CRORE IN LOSSESThe accumulated losses in the last two months since the BJP manifesto promised closure of illegal slaughterhouses runs into Rs 4,000 crore, according to All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association. Association members recently met Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow and requested him to intervene in protecting legal business and clear confusion.Four mechanised plants, which slaughter and process buffalo meat, were shut last week by district administration across UP. Two of them were in Meerut and one each in Bijnor and Saharanpur.The exporters' association said while the move by the government is against illegal slaughterhouses, an overzealous tribe of officers and vigilante groups have forced even legal traders to suspend operations. ""Transporting meat is a risky task nowadays and only very few vehicle-owners are ready to stick their necks out,"" said a meat trader.But numbers speak for themselves. ""UP has only 41 slaughter houses, which are certified by the Union ministry. These units contribute to 60-70 per cent of the total export of buffalo meat, worth around Rs 320 billion. The fear of closure is among the owners' mind, who are now being troubled by several agencies,"" Fauzan Alavi, member secretary of the exporters' association told MAIL TODAY.CERTIFICATION PROCESS A TEDIOUS PROCESS, SAYS SMALL SLAUGHTERHOUSESSeveral small illegal slaughterhouses that the MAIL TODAY team spoke to were united in complaining that certification process for an abattoir is a tedious process, often requiring multiple clearances at the state and central level. ""It is not feasible for a small operator to attain all the clearances,"" said one such owner, who downed shutters soon after Yogi's ascension as CM.The closure of these slaughterhouses has a ripple effect on smaller units selling meat or cooked preparations. A number of small eateries and mobile food carts in Muzaffarnagar and Ghaziabad have been out of business.Chetan, a chicken shop owner at Murad Nagar in Ghaziabad, told MAIL TODAY that 20 members of his family are dependent on his shop, running for seven years. But now, uncertainty looms on them as he could be forced to look for other job. ""Police warned me to shut the shop. I have put a curtain at the entry of my shop to keep business limited only to loyal customers. I will apply for a license at the tehsil office and if I do not get it, I would think of another business like selling vegetables,"" he said.""Taking surprise decisions is the BJP's trademark,"" said owner of a food cart, Ishaan Qureshi, in Muzaffarnagar.

China to block Internet VPNs from 2018,"China will completely block access to much of the global internet as part of a sweeping crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent and maintaining the Communist party?s grip on power.The government has ordered China?s three telecommunications companies to completely block access to virtual private networks, or VPNs, by February 2018, Bloomberg News reported, citing anonymous sources. The three internet providers, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are all state-owned.China operates the largest internet censorship regime in the world, blocking access to thousands of websites including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Internet controls also mean news and commentary critical of the ruling Communist party and information about events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre are almost impossible to find within China.But millions of Chinese citizens circumvent China?s censorship system, known as the Great Firewall, by using a VPN, allowing unfettered access to any website. The latest directive comes as China prepares for a twice a decade political meeting in Beijing in late 2017, with various factions within the government jockeying for dominance in any potential shuffle of top officials. It also comes on the heels of a 14-month ?cleanup? of internet services announced in January, part of president Xi Jinping?s push for so-called ?internet sovereignty?. ?This is a significantly escalated form of internet control and shows there is unprecedented urgency and desperation at the top of the government,? said Xiao Qiang, a professor focusing on censorship in China at the University of California, Berkeley. ?This is clearly about the highest levels of political struggle and the different factions using the internet as their battlefield.?If Xi?s opponents cannot release information inside China because of the censorship apparatus, they do it outside China and then the information filters back.?Xiao pointed to recent cracks in the Great Firewall, including allegations of corruption levelled by a Chinese businessman in New York that have managed to circulate widely within China. The claims, many unverified, have been seen as damaging to the head of the country?s corruption watchdog and one of Xi?s closest allies. In the coming months Xiao predicted the authorities would step up their internet crackdown: ?There have always been controls, but this will be another level?.The ban on VPNs could also harm academics, software developers and foreign businesses. For years Chinese researchers have complained they lack adequate access to overseas journals and methods to communicate with universities around the world, while developers rely on code hosted on websites based outside China. Foreign businesses in China often use VPNs to secure their company data or communicate with company headquarters. It is not clear whether the ban will affect corporate VPNs.?This is ridiculous. If they?re as interested in security and stability as they say they are, then they should leave VPNs accessible,? Kaiser Kuo, former head of international communications at Chinese tech giant Baidu, posted online. ?The number of people using them in China is really small, but really vocal ? and I don?t think they?ll just take this lying down. Will reflect very badly on the party. Dark days ahead.?Earlier this month a popular Chinese VPN was forced to shut down after ?receiving a notice from regulatory departments?.China has instituted bans on VPNs and other methods to bypass censorship in the past, especially during high-level government meetings in Beijing. But it remains to be seen whether the latest directive will become permanent.",technology,3662,38,70

Donald Trump calls for transparent Mexico border wall,"Donald Trump doesn?t see the need for a proposed border wall to stretch the length of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218 km) frontier with Mexico.Instead, he envisions ?anywhere from 700 (1,126 km) to 900 miles (1,448 km) of see-through wall?.Trump?s comments on the wall are the most definitive description he has given on what became a primary campaign promise. During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a ?big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door? to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ?It?s a 2,000-mile border, but you don?t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don?t really have people crossing.?There are already about 650 miles (1,046 km) of fencing along the border, all of which is see-through.Trump?s remarks were informal and initially not allowed to be reported. The White House later provided a partial transcript of them.The Mexican border in much of Texas is defined by the Rio Grande, though parts of that river are little more than a trickle of water. About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall ?needs transparency?.?You have to be able to see through it,? Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.?As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don?t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds (27 kg) of stuff? It?s over,? Trump said.Drug smugglers have tried to fling bundles of drugs over parts of the roughly 650 miles of border that already has fencing or other barriers, using tactics including sling shots and catapults. But it?s unclear if anyone has ever been injured by the flying contraband.This year the government issued two notices for border wall proposals. The first called for a solid structure up to 30 ft (9.14 meters) high that couldn?t be easily breached. The second bid notice called for other types of walls, including something that could be seen through.Homeland security secretary John Kelly has said that border agents need to be able to see what is on the other side of a barrier for security and safety reasons. He has repeatedly said that Trump?s proposed wall would not be ?sea to shining sea?, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east.",general,2633,53,70

Shiv Sena leader arrested over Mumbai building collapse,"A dozen people, including two infants, were killed when a 35-year-old four-storey building collapsed on Tuesday in the Ghatkopar suburb of Mumbai, a tragedy that repeats almost every monsoon in India?s space-starved financial capital.The Siddhi Sai building at Damodar Park near Shreyas cinema in western Ghatkopar came apart and trapped more than 20 people around 10.45am. Many of them are still under the rubble.Among the dead were four old people, three-month-old Renuka Thak and Krishu Dongre, who was one-and-a-half years old.The ground floor housed a nursing home, which was vacant, while the rest of the building was occupied by three or four families on each floor. Lalit Thak, who lost daughter Renuka, had shifted to the building from nearby slums three months ago.Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap, who owns the ground floor and allegedly made structural changes that weakened the building, was charged with culpable homicide and detained by police.Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar denied Shitap was from his party and said: ?Appropriate action must be taken against the culprit, whoever he is.?Residents said pillars and beams were damaged when the ground floor was renovated and that caused the building to collapse. Civic officials, however, refused to assign a reason and said the cause will be known after investigation.Binita Ramchandani, a resident whose mother was injured, blamed the Shiv Sena leader for the tragedy.?Despite residents objecting his altering the building?s pillars, he went ahead because of his political clout. He was trying to convert it into a guesthouse,? she alleged.Pravin Chheda, a Congress leader, said Shitap must compensate the people.Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta ordered a probe while police are investigating if negligence is involved in the disaster.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, there were 15 flats, three each on every floor, of which nine were vacant.The fire brigade pressed 90 personnel, 14 engines, two rescue vans and nine ambulances in its rescue efforts. About 300 rescuers, including National Disaster Response Force members, were working late into the night, looking for signs of life and bodies trapped in the rubble.Sanjay Pawar, from the nearby slums, said he dashed for the site after hearing a crashing sound that he initially thought came from a falling tree. Samriddhi Mayekar, another slum-dweller who worked at the building, saw the structure shake vigorously before it came crashing down.Building collapses are common in Mumbai, especially during the monsoon that runs from late June to September.The civic authorities conduct pre-rain checks and declare buildings unsafe when they find one. The Ghatkopar apartment did not feature among the dangerous buildings on the BMC?s list of 791 structures identified unsafe this year.But Mumbai is susceptible with millions forced to live in cramped, ramshackle properties because of rising real estate prices and a lack of housing for the poor.The city has been hit by several deadly building collapses in recent years, often caused by shoddy construction, poor quality materials or ageing buildings.In 2013, 145 people were killed in three separate building collapses around Mumbai, the highest in recent years.A dilapidated building left 12 people dead when it collapsed near the city in August 2015. Nine people died the same month when another old three-storey building collapsed in monsoon rain in the Mumbai suburb of Thakurli.In a separate incident on Tuesday, a building partially collapsed in Kolkata after days of rain.

The challenge for you before the start of the long home season season was to reinforce your Test credentials, cement your batting position. You have reclaimed that No.3 spot now.A. I have been batting well. Especially at No.3. I wouldn't say it's my spot but this is where I have scored all my runs. That's where I have succeeded in domestic cricket and now internationally. So very happy to play at No.3. As a team also we have played some really good cricket in 2016. We want to maintain that. Q. The other debate at the start of the season was around your strike rate. How much hard work did it take to address that? How much support did you get from the team management?A. Anil bhai has been good. He knows what is the commitment and discipline required at Test level. He and Virat (Kohli) both have been motivating. Anil bhai asked me to keep positive intent. I think if I am positive, the bowler has to try to do something different. That's helped. So I have improved in strike rate. But it's not something I have to worry too much about as long as I am scoring and we are winning.Q. Your thoughts on the next Test against Bangladesh. A team not too foreign to Indian conditions.A. Bangladesh are a good team. They do well in Asia. So we can't take them lightly. But at the same time our bowlers have been bowling very well. Our fast bowlers, our spinners and our lower-middle order contributions. If we continue playing the same way we should be able to beat them.Q. Australia will come next after Bangladesh. Their Test cricket is going through a bit of a slump. India will fancy their chances?A. You can't underestimate Australia. They play well at home and we do have an advantage here. But they always come up with some plan. So we will have the counter those.Q. And they are not the only ones that sledge anymore. Perhaps some of you would want to remind them what happened the last time they came to India.A. Yes it will be challenging for Australia in India. If they sledge..I remember we had a plan to sledge them when we last went to Australia. It will be tough for them when they come here.Q. Who will be the sledging leader in the side?",general,3666,56,70
RBI Governor's basic pay hiked nearly 180% to ?2.5 lakh,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel and his deputies have got a big pay hike with the government more than doubling their basic salary to Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 2.25 lakh per month, respectively.The ""basic pay of the Governor and Deputy Governors"" have been revised retrospectively with effect from January 1, 2016 and marks a huge jump from Rs 90,000 basic pay so far drawn by the Governor and Rs 80,000 for his deputies.Still, their salaries are much lower than the top executives of various banks regulated by the RBI.The monthly emoluments of these top RBI officials include basic pay, dearness allowance and other payments, which totaled Rs 2,09,500 in case of Patel as on November 30, 2016, as per the latest information disclosed on the RBI website.In response to a query by PTI under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the central bank has now disclosed that as per a Finance Ministry communication, dated February 21, the basic pay of the Governor and Deputy Governors have been revised.Following the revision, the basic pay of the Governor stands increased to Rs 2,50,000 per month while the same for a Deputy Governor would be Rs 2,25,000, RBI said.The pay hike is ""with effect from January 1, 2016"".Dearness Allowance would be notified by the central government from time to time while ""all other allowances (are) to be paid at existing rates as if the pay has not been received with effect from January 1, 2016,"" the RTI reply said.The RBI, however, did not disclose the new gross pay for Patel and his deputies following the revision in basic pay.With the earlier basic pay of Rs 90,000, Patel got a DA of Rs 1,12,500 and other payments of Rs 7,000 -- totalling to a gross pay of Rs 2,09,500. The increase in the basic itself would take his gross pay to nearly Rs 3.70 lakh.Patel, who took over the reins of the central bank in September 2016, had received a salary of Rs 2.09 lakh in October -- the first full month in office. This amount was same as drawn by his predecessor Raghuram Rajan in August that year.Rajan assumed RBI governorship from September 5, 2013 at a monthly salary of Rs 1.69 lakh. His salary was revised to Rs 1.78 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh respectively during 2014 and March 2015. His salary was raised to Rs 2.09 lakh from Rs 2.04 lakh in January 2016.It was not clear whether Rajan, who left RBI on September 4, 2016, would be eligible for arrears as the basic pay for Governor has been revised retrospectively while covering little more than nine months of his tenure.Currently, RBI has four deputy governors - R Gandhi, S S Mundra, N S Vishwanathan and Viral V Acharya.",general,2610,55,70
Bill tabled in Lok Sabha to cap lavish spending on weddings,"New Delhi, Feb 15 (PTI) A Bill in the Lok Sabha seeks to put a limit on the number of guests to be invited and dishes to be served in weddings to check ""show of wealth"" and wants those spending above Rs 5 lakh to contribute towards marriages of poor girls. If a family spends above Rs 5 lakh on a wedding, it has to contribute 10 per cent of the amount on marriages of girls from poor families, according to the Bill introduced by Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan, wife of MP Pappu Yadav. The Marriages (Compulsory Registration and Prevention of Wasteful Expenditure) Bill, 2016, may be taken up as a private members Bill in the upcoming Lok Sabha session. The purpose of this Bill is to prohibit extravagant and wasteful expenditure on marriages and to enforce simpler solemnisation, Ranjeet told PTI. ""Great importance should be assigned to the solemnisation of marriage between two individuals. But unfortunately, these days a tendency of celebrating marriages with pomp and show and spending lavishly growing in the country.

Gurugram apartment fixes potholes after civic body refuses,"Tired of waiting for the authorities to take up repairs of their damaged road, residents of the upscale Fresco apartments in Sector 50 took the onus on themselves instead. Upset over the civic body allegedly dragging its feet in the matter, residents pooled money and got a fresh layer of concrete laid on the road.They used cold mix technology to fill the potholes, which is five times cheaper than the concrete material generally used in road repairs. Residents said the monsoon would have made entry to their residential complex an arduous affair if they had not taken this step.Cold mix asphalt is a combination of mineral aggregate and emulsified or cutback asphalt with additives.The residential society is located inside Nirvana Country and the 140-metre stretch connecting the society to the main road, was badly damaged and riddled with potholes.After the MCG allegedly refused to re-lay the road despite repeated requests, residents decided to collect money and run repairs on the stretch. The move, they said, was critical to saving their vehicles from getting damaged.?We conducted a survey among our residents using technology and the social media. We used Google forums asking residents to choose between three options ? wait for the MCG to repair the road, contribute money and repair the road or put pressure on the builder and ask them to repair the road,? Nilesh Tandon, president, RWA, Fresco apartments, said.As many as 70% of residents opted for contributing money and building the road.Based on the survey response, the RWA members did a research on the material required to lay new road and fill the potholes. Since monsoon was approaching, using bitumen was not the solution as unless there is a proper drainage system, water accumulates on the road and the bitumen gets washed away.?We found that in the Western countries cold mix technology is used to fill potholes and this technology has also used in the Northeast and south India. We got in touch with some organsations in Bangalore and Hyderabad who had been using this technology and took their advice. A lot of data was available on the internet and we learnt about the advantages of using cold mix,? Tandon said.Read I 7-year wait ends, Fresco apartments in?Gurgaon to get canal water connectionResidents got tenders of ?15 lakh to lay the new road, but by adopting cold mix technology they could fix the potholes by spending ?1.5 lakh, saving 90% of the money.The RWA sought a voluntary contribution of ?1,000 and spread the word using WhatsApp groups.

Sting operation reveals Apple staff misled users on Error 53,"Australia?s consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after a so-called ?error 53? malfunction, court documents reveal.Australian authorities lodged a high-profile case against Apple this year, after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a malfunction that rendered phones useless if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.That advice was allegedly given even where the repair ? a screen replacement, for example ? was not related to the fault.Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCC?s allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apple?s response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.?In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,? the ACCC?s court claim alleged. Error 53 generally occurred after a user tried to update their phone to iOS 8 or iOS 9, and affected about one in every 1,000 phones supplied by Apple or its resellers between September 2014 and February 2016. Australian consumer law clearly protects the right of a customer to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of unacceptable quality. The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple US?s website misled customers about their rights. The website told users experiencing error 53 that: ?If the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else, contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.?Apple, in response, said the undercover calls made by the ACCC cannot be considered as breaches because consumer law does not exist in ?hypothetical circumstances?. The company said that real customers who had called the store would have received other information from Apple that informed them of their rights under consumer law. Apple denied the message on its US website was an ?express representation? that consumers were not entitled to a free replacement or repair. Apple said the website was referring only to the conditions of the company?s own limited warranty, which existed in addition to a customer?s statutory rights. It was only one part of the communications between the company and its customers over error 53, the company said, and must be interpreted in the broader context. Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCC?s case. It also released an update in February last year to resolve the problem and restore the functionality of affected devices. Apple has previously faced court action in the United States relating to error 53, but the case was thrown out last year.",technology,3779,60,70

Describing how the alleged siphoning off the funds happened in this case, the agency said, ""It is suspected that major portion out of amount of Rs 417.29 crore was remitted out of India to overseas parties from IDBI bank."" It mentioned a transaction made to a firm which allegedly had fake or dummy directors. ""An amount of Rs 63.10 crore (approximately) was paid to Ms UBICS Technologies Pvt Ltd (controlled by Mallya). Directors are dummy directors acting on behalf of Mallya. ""This company was used as a special purpose vehicle to route the funds of Ms KFA as no other transaction from any other company has been noticed in this,"" it said. ""Thus, the acts of Mallya, Ms UBHL and others, establish that a criminal conspiracy was hatched for obtaining or sanctioning of bank loan to KFA in gross violations of established procedures and the airline had no intention for repayment of loan of Rs 900 crore since beginning.

GST will lead to inflation as well as confusion: Digvijaya,"Pune, Jul 4 (PTI) Slamming the BJP for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh today said the new tax system would not succeed and it would give rise to inflation as well as confusion. ""We were in favour of one slab of tax, that is 18 per cent and simple compliance procedure. However, the present structure of the GST they have created, it is certainly going to be an unsuccessful enterprise,"" he told reporters here. ""Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia is an honest man, but they are trying to implement the GST through impractical ways and with this kind of implementation, confusion will be created, which will initially give rise to inflation in the country....The GST will not be successful,"" he said. Singh was in the city after visiting Pandharpur in Solapur district in Maharashtra, where lakhs of devotees throng on the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi celebrated today. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister also slammed the ruling BJP saying when it was in the opposition, the party had said that the GST will not be successful in the country, whereas it is now labelling the move as ""revolutionary"". ""Celebrations took place at midnight as if the country has got second freedom,"" Singh said. He added that the countries where the GST has become successful, have chosen a single tax slab structure. ""PM Modi is saying that it is good and simple tax, but it is not a reality. There are six slabs and petrol and liquor have been kept out of the GST and filing of tax returns have been made so complicated,"" he said. ""Previously, taxpayers used to file tax returns only four times, but now the same taxpayer will have to file tax 37 times and firms will have to appoint chartered accountants on a permanent basis,"" said Singh. ""The way demonetisation was implemented without printing of new notes, the same way they have now rolled out the GST without any preparation, as so far the returns formats are not available, there is a lack of infrastructure, such as internet connectivity, in remote areas,"" he alleged. Taking a dig at the prime minister, the Congress general secretary said, ""Modiji said that in order to eradicate black money, they have brought the GST, but alcohol which is the main source of black money, have been kept out of the GST."" Accusing the BJP and RSS for inciting violence and creating a communal rift in the society, Singh alleged that ""targeted lynching"" of Muslims is the dangerous thing for the country. ""Modi tweets over small issues, but he did not tweet about the farmers, who were killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh. We want a prime minister, who does not have 56 inch chest, but who has a 56 inch heart,"" Singh said. Talking about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar supporting NDAs presidential nominee Ram Nath Kovind, the Congress leader said it was Kumar, who had fist pushed for the the unified oppositions candidate, although he later supported Kovind. While speaking on farmers condition in the country, Singh said demonetisation hit farmers in a big way. ""In Maharashtra, the state government announced the farm loan waiver. However, some farmers told me that the government has put a condition that farmers have to clear their outstanding loan, only after which they will get the loan waiver up to Rs 1.5 lakh,"" he said.",general,3309,58,70
Russian athlete stripped of London Olympics gold for doping,"Russia's Mariya Savinova-Farnosova has been stripped of her 800m London 2012 Olympic Games gold medal after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday imposed a four-year ban saying there was ""clear evidence"" she used performance-enhancing drugs.She is the latest in a growing list of Russian athletes to have past Olympic medals taken away over doping, as the nation struggles to overcome its most widespread doping scandal ever.The retroactive four-year penalty starts from Aug. 24, 2015, but CAS also disqualified all Savinova's results from July 26, 2010, to Aug. 19, 2013, thereby stripping her of her 2011 world championships gold, 2013 world silver and 2010 European gold.The athlete has 45 days to consider whether to appeal the CAS decision.The case against her was initiated by the world athletics federation IAAF, which has also maintained a ban on Russian track and field athletes over the country's doping affair.South Africa's double silver medallist Caster Semenya is now in line to be promoted to gold in both the 2012 Olympics and 2011 world championships.The 31-year-old Savinova was among the athletes that a commission set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) recommended be banned for life in 2015.Russian Ekaterina Poistogova had finished third in the race at the London Games, but she is also on the list of athletes WADA is recommending a lifetime ban for.Pamela Jelimo of Kenya was fourth and is now in contention for a medal. Jelimo had won gold in Beijing four years earlier.""On the basis of clear evidence, including the evidence derived from her biological passport, Mariya Savinova-Farnosova is found to have been engaged in using doping from 26 July 2010 through to 19 August 2013,"" CAS said.",sports,1736,59,70

Rangoon not showing censor certificate during screening: CBFC,"Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut and their latest film Rangoon is in new trouble. The film has rubbed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) the wrong way, as a result of which, it might land in a legal mess.Rangoon, directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, is playing in theatres without a censor certificate and the anti-tobacco short films. As a result, the CBFC is mighty miffed with the makers of Rangoon. While on the one hand, Rangoon any which way, hasn't been getting any love at the ticket windows, this will end up adding to the plethora of problems the film is battling.Pahlaj Nihalani, the chairperson of the CBFC, told DNA, ""It has been brought to our notice that Rangoon has been playing in theatres across the country and outside India without the censor certificate and without the anti-smoking short films, which are compulsory for all films that show actors smoking and/or drinking. Rangoon had many scenes showing the main leads indulging in serious substance abuse. We asked the makers to put a disclaimer ahead of the opening credits. That disclaimer has gone missing. Now, we have been informed that the anti-smoking films do not play at the beginning and after the intermission. And also that the censor certificate is not flashed at the start, as per law. These are serious offences.""The film, which is a love story set against the backdrop of the World War II, stars Saif Ali Khan as film producer Rusi Bilimoria, Kangana Ranaut as the fiesty Miss Julia (a character based on Fearless Nadia), and Shahid Kapoor as Jamadar Nawab Malik of the British Indian Army.Rangoon, said Nihalani, has flouted several rules set by the CBFC. And if found true, the CBFC chairman told the tabloid, action will be taken against the team.""We are taking legal action against the digital operators, to begin with. We would not like to point fingers at anyone else for the lapse at this time. It is the digital operators' responsibility to play exactly the length that is shown to us and certified by the CBFC. Not a second more or less of footage must be shown in theatres than what we have certified. The exact length of the film that is shown to us and certified by us is mentioned in the censor certificate. If the anti-smoking films have been removed from the beginning and after intermission and if the censor certificate is not being shown in Rangoon, then, the digital operators are screening less footage than what has been approved by the CBFC. It is a serious offence. We are investigating to see how deep the offence goes,"" said Nihalani.The CBFC head went on to add, ""Maybe some self-appointed intellectuals of our film industry feel it is okay to break the law as long as they can ridicule the jurisdiction of the CBFC."" Rangoon's laidback pace and lack of a coherent storyline has been pointed out as reasons behind its worrisome performance at the box office in India.

SC scraps Bihar topper scam mastermind Bachcha Rai's bail,"The Supreme Court today cancelled the conditional bail granted by the Patna High Court in February this year to Amit Kumar alias Bachcha Rai, the alleged kingpin of the Bihar topper scam.The Nitish Kumar government had moved the Supreme Court asking for the removal of the bail, which was granted in case Rai is not convicted by a lower court within a month.Rai is currently lodged in a jail along with other key accused, including Lalkeshwar Singh, former Chairman of the Bihar School Examination Board, and his wife Usha Sinha.Bachcha Rai, the Secretary-cum Principal of Vishun Rai College in Vaishali district of Bihar, was arrested in June last year. It was from this college that Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shrestha - Class XII Arts and Science toppers respectively - were caught on camera with absolutely no knowledge of their streams.The video featuring Ruby has her describing political science as ""prodigal science"" and saying the subject that she topped was about cooking. Similarly, Saurabh Shreshtha was seen giving wrong answers to basic science questions.The sting by a TV news channel suggested that the ""toppers"" may have cheated to achieve their ranks.

Rajasthan vendors protest child marriages by refusing supply,"With an aim to help terminate the extensively prevalent issue of child marriage in the country, over 45,000 tent vendors from the state of Rajasthan have decided to turn their backs towards those who facilitate the social evil.The vendors, who come under the umbrella of the Rajasthan Tent Dealers Kiraya Vyavsai Samiti, have taken it upon themselves to closely verify and scrutinise the birth documents of the bride and groom, each time they're approached for wedding supplies.Also Read: Shocking video: 6-year-old girls married off in RajasthanBut their role doesn't just end there. If there is a discrepancy in the birth certificates and they feel a child marriage is what is being planned, the association has also taken the responsibility of informing the nearest police station. ""If anyone comes to book us to supply the tent and do other decorations, we will ask for the birth certificate of the boy and girl to ensure it is not a child marriage. In case a person or group of persons gives us wrong information, we will immediately inform the police and other government officials for the required intervention,"" Ravi Jindal, the president of the group Rajasthan Tent Dealers Kiraya Vyavsai Samiti told The Times of India.As horrific as the act of child marriage itself is, its prominence in some Indian states--Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka in particular--is what makes the situation all the more alarming. The Logical Indian reports, ""India ranks sixth in the world in the number of child marriages that happen every year. According to the Census report of 2011, nearly 17 million Indian children between the ages of 10 and 19 are married.

Leopard kills 2-year-old boy on walk with family in Mumbai,"A two-year-old boy was attacked and killed by a leopard on Saturday evening, close to Film City in Goregaon (East).The Mumbai forest range said the incident took place around 5.30pm at Moracha Pada, near the helipad at Aarey. Vihaan Nilesh Garuda, the son of a Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) staffer Nilesh Garuda, suffered injuries on his neck and was rushed to the Hindu Hruday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Municipal Hospital at Jogeshwari, where he was declared dead.?The incident took place when Vihaan was with 15 members of his family. They had come for an evening walk to Aarey. As the elders walked ahead, Vihaan was grabbed by the leopard and taken away within seconds,? said Sameer Inamdar, round forest officer, Mumbai forest range. ?The family searched for him and found the leopard had left the boy?s body a few metres from where it grabbed him.?Inamdar said the body was badly bruised and Vihaan died of blood loss. ?The leopard did not eat any part of Vihaan?s body,?

Man claiming to have saved Gandhi from Godse earlier dies,"Bhiku Daji Bhilare, who was claimed to have saved Mahatma Gandhi from being killed by Nathuram Godse in 1944, passed away today after a brief illness.The 98-year-old Gandhian, popularly known as ?Bhilare Guruji?, was cremated at his village, Bhilar, in Mahabaleshwar Teshil in western Maharashtra?s Satara district, family sources said.Bhilare, born on November 28, 1919, is survived by three sons.While there is no documented history about Bhilare having foiled Godse?s earlier attack, the great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Tushar Gandhi, in his new book has dwelled on how fundamentalists had planned and made many attempts on the life of the Father of the Nation before he was finally killed.According to him, there were four attempts on the Mahatma?s life, before Godse killed him in 1948.The attack at Panchgani in 1944, where Bhilare Guruji overpowered Nathuram, was the second of these attempts, he has claimed in the book.?(In) July 1944, after his release from the Aga Khan Palace Prison Camp in May 1944, Gandhi contracted malaria and was advised rest by his physician. He retired to Panchgani, a mountain resort near Poona (now Pune), where he stayed at Dilkhush Bungalow.?A group of 18 or 20 men reached Panchgani by a chartered bus from Poona and held a day-long protest against Gandhi. When Gandhi was told about this, he contacted the leader of the group, Nathuram Vinayak Godse, for a discussion. Nathuram rejected the invitation and continued with his demonstration,? the book says.?During a prayer meeting that evening, Nathuram Godse, dressed in a Nehru shirt, pajama and jacket, rushed towards Gandhi. He was brandishing a dagger in his hand and shouting anti-Gandhi slogans. Godse was overpowered by Manishankar Purohit, the proprietor of the Surti lodge of Poona, and D Bhilare Guruji of Satara, who later became a Congress legislator from Mahabaleshwar. The other youth accompanying Godse ran away,? it saidIn 2008, at an event in Mumbai, Bhilare was lauded for having had the presence of mind and the daring to twist the knife out of Nathuram Godse?s hand as he rushed to kill Gandhiji in a frenzy.In 1944, Bhilare was the taluka pramukh of the Rashtra Seva Dal.?It was a wet July evening in Panchgani in 1944,? Bhilare Guruji had recalled at the event.?All of us had assembled in the Batha High School hall for the evening prayers when suddenly a door opposite me opened and in rushed Nathuram Godse. He was wielding a knife and muttering incoherently.?Bhilare blocked his path and twisted the knife out of his hand.?My colleagues in the Seva Dal were also quick to react, and threw him out of the premises,? he had recalled.Bhilare had also claimed that Gopal Godse and Narayan Apte, who were implicated in the Mahatma?s assassination, were present at the spot.The Panchgani incident has been documented in the memoirs of Gandhiji?s close associate, said Pyarelal, a functionary of Mani Bhawan in Mumbai from where Mahatma Gandhi initiated satyagraha and propagated the cause of swadeshi.",general,3015,57,70
Ticketless passenger stabs ticket examiner on train in Delhi,"A train ticket examiner (TTE) was allegedly stabbed by three unidentified men who were asked to deboard the train as they were travelling without tickets in the reserved compartment. The incident took place on a train that was moving from the New Delhi railway station late Sunday night.The injured TTE was rushed to a private hospital in Ghaziabad after the government railway police (GRP) stopped the train at Ghaziabad junction.Diwakar Boro, the TTE who is based in Guwahati, was examining tickets onboard the Poorvottar Sampark Kranti Express, which had left the New Delhi railway station around 11.45pm for Guwahati on Sunday. The victim was allegedly stabbed by one of the three young men, who then jumped out of the moving train.?I asked the three men to deboard the train as they did not have tickets. They had boarded a reserved coach of the train. Instead, they asked me not to bother and also hurled abuses when I tried to be stern in asking them to deboard. They looked like locals and were aged 18-22 years. However, one of them hit me with a sharp-edged weapon,? Boro said.?Initially, I did not realise that I was injured. But when I saw blood, I realised that it was a deep cut on my arm. Other passengers later pulled the chain and informed a guard. The guard alerted the authorities and the train was stopped at Ghaziabad. The GRP officials and doctors were ready with an ambulance and I was rushed to the hospital,? he said.The GRP officials at Ghaziabad said that the victim suffered injuries on his arms.?We asked him to lodge a complaint but he said that as the incident took place in New Delhi, he will lodge a complaint there. We are taking proper care and have also informed our Delhi counterparts,? said Randhir Singh, circle officer (GRP), Ghaziabad.The victim said that officers from GRP and the railway protection force of New Delhi came to Ghaziabad and registered his complaint.This is the second case of violence in moving train in the recent past. In a previous incident, on the night of July 26, 13 passengers of Farakka Express were allegedly robbed by five armed robbers when the train had stopped for a brief period near Seelampur in Delhi. The train was also stopped at Ghaziabad and the GRP registered the initial complaint from the passengers.",lifestyle,2282,60,70
House where Hitler was born to be turned into charity,"Austria?s parliament has passed a law allowing authorities to expropriate the house in which Adolf Hitler was born in 1889.The law, passed on Wednesday night, ends years of dispute between the building?s owner, Gerlinde Pommer, and the authorities in Braunau am Inn. For years, Pommer refused to sell the building or allow it to be renovated.Pommer, who once ran it as a guesthouse and was compensated by the government with a generous level of rent to prevent it from becoming a lure for neo-Nazi tourists, is due to be compensated for the loss of the three-storey house with an undisclosed sum. But quite what the government plans to do with it remains unclear.While their main aim is to prevent the building becoming a shrine for the steady stream of neo-Nazi supporters who still make their way to Braunau, there has been an ongoing discussion over what more positive purpose it might serve. Ideas have ranged from turning it into a labour office or a cultural centre to tearing it down altogether, though detractors say that would amount to an attempt to erase Austria?s Nazi past. Heritage experts are against pulling it down, arguing the house has an important place in Braunau?s architectural history.Marcus Franz, an independent politician, has suggested the Bulgarian wrapping artist Christo should be invited to cover it up as an art installation.Previous uses have included a workshop for people with learning difficulties and a day centre operated by a local charity, which rented the building from Pommer but was forced to give up the lease after she refused to carry out any repairs.Hitler was born on the top floor of the house on 20 April 1889. Close to the border with Germany, Braunau has never been able to shake its association with the Nazi leader. ?It is not so seldom that neo-Nazis stop in front of the house to be photographed making the Hitler greeting,? Harry Buchmayr, a Social Democrat who lives in Braunau, told parliament. Walter Rosenkranz, of the rightwing Freedom party, defended parliament?s decision to buy the building. ?Expropriation is not a nice thing, rather the last resort,? he said. ?But we?ve had five years of negotiations that were carried out in a very considerate way, but which didn?t lead to any result.?",world,2256,53,70
17-yr-old 500-hitter selected in Mumbai's Ranji team,"Not all of them may have had their first razor experience but they are ready to smell the perfume ball. Prithvi Shaw's initiation into the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team, aged 17 completes the trio of Mumbai cricket's boy wonders' transition to higher grade cricket. That each one of them have been chosen for Ranji Trophy before reaching adulthood is reassuring that the record makers haven't just been flash in the pan.Prithvi who has made the squad for a game none less than a Ranji Trophy semi-final to be played against Tamil Nadu on January 1 is fresh from a victorious Asia Cup U-19 campaign under Rahul Dravid's tutelage. Prithvi who first made news, aged 14, scoring a record individual score of 546 in the famed Harris Shield, made 191 runs from five matches as an opener in Asia Cup for India U-19. Mumbai's Chairman of selectors Milind Rege while wishing the youngster well did admit Shaw benefitted from lack of quality opening options knocking at the selectors' door. ""Prithvi has scored runs in age group cricket. So we want to try him out. But honestly it's also true that we have struggled to find two good openers for the past two years. With Akhil Herwadkar unavailable, we wanted to reward Prithvi for the runs he has scored,"" Rege told India Today.Rege did add that having had a word with Dravid convinced the selectors to pick Prithvi. ""He did think highly of his batting abilities when I spoke to him,"" he said. The Mumbai selectors would hope Prithvi's transition from cricketing adolescence to adulthood is more fruitful than another boy wonder, Armaan Jaffer, they tried earlier in the season. Armaan whose schools' record of 498 runs was bettered by Prithvi, could only muster 44 runs in the six innings he played for Mumbai.Rege agrees bridging the gap between age group cricket to Ranji Trophy does not come easy. ""I was surprised Armaan did not do well. He is a very organized player. But making the grade from age group cricket to Ranji Trophy is as difficult as is the one from first class to international cricket,"" he says.",general,2052,52,70
Tech Mahindra says it will benefit from Vodafone-Idea merger,"Mumbai, Feb 19 (PTI) Tech Mahindra sees the proposed merger of Vodafone and Idea as a ""seismic"" event that will impact the IT sector, but asserted that it will benefit from such a deal.

"Nitish-BJP alliance unfortunate, against mandate: Sharad","Senior Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav on Monday said he didn?t agree with the decision in Bihar, calling it unfortunate in his first comments on his party walking out of the ruling grand alliance and going back to the BJP.Talking to mediapersons in Delhi, Yadav said the mandate was not for the JD (U) to join hands with the BJP.?I don?t agree with the decision in Bihar. It is unfortunate,? Yadav told reporters outside Parliament.?The mandate of the people (2015 Bihar assembly polls) was not for this,? the Rajya Sabha member said.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had on July 26 resigned his position, ending his party?s two-year tie-up with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress. Kumar, who is also the JD (U) president, returned as the chief minister in less than 18 hours with the backing of the BJP with which he had broken ties in 2013.Kumar walked out of the ruling coalition citing corruption charges against his deputy Tejashwi Yadav, who is the son of and RJD chief Lalu Prasad.While some senior JD (U) leaders have publically spoke against Kumar?s move, Yadav had not said anything until Monday. The RJD and the Congress have accused Kumar of being an opportunist and joining hands with ?communal and fascist forces? he had promised to take on.Reports have said Kumar and finance minister Arun Jaitley spoke to Yadav and tried to mollify him.Prasad said on Saturday he had spoken to Yadav and invited him to lead the fight against the BJP and Kumar.Kumar?s decision to end the so-called grand alliance not only altered dramatically the political scenario in India?s third most populous state but also dealt a blow to the opposition parties looking to replicate the Bihar model to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.",general,1754,57,70
Colombia's cocaine production reaches record high,"Colombia has spent years trying to shake off its reputation as the cocaine capital of the world, but the country is producing more of the drug than ever before, according to new figures from the United Nations.An estimated 866 tonnes of cocaine were produced at clandestine labs across the country in 2016, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2015, the estimate was 649.In terms of the area planted with coca, the raw material used for cocaine, Colombia is back at the same levels as in 2001, when a huge US-backed anti-narcotics effort known as Plan Colombia was just getting under way. Coca crops covered 146,000 hectares in 2016, up 52% from 96,000 in 2015. Higher yields from mature plants mean more cocaine can be produced per hectare planted.The results of the study ?show a complex panorama?, said Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC?s representative in Colombia.José Ángel Mendoza, the head of Colombia?s counter-narcotics police, said Colombia faced ?a difficult historical moment?, but stressed that the figures reflected the state of the country on 31 December 2016.Since then, the government has put in place an ambitious plan to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coca by the year?s end. Half of that amount is to be forcibly eradicated, and the other half removed through crop substitution agreements with coca farmers.The substitution program is part of a peace deal with Farc rebels, who renounced drug trafficking as part of their demobilization deal. During much of the group?s 53 years as an armed insurgency, it financed its fight through the drug trade.Former combatants have committed to work with the government to convince farmers to replace coca crops with another way to make a living.?The history of drug crops is divided in two: before and after the beginning of the post-conflict period,? said Enrique Gil Botero, the justice minister.Already 40% of the goal of forced eradication has been met, and 86,000 families ? who account for as much as 76,000 hectares of coca ? have signed on to crop substitution programs in exchange for subsidies of about $11,000 per farmer over the course of two years, according to the government.?Having the Farc on the side of substitution and not on the other side makes a difference,? said Rodrigo Pardo, who heads the government agency in charge of implementing the peace agreement.But the deal on crop substitution with the Farc, announced before the final peace deal was finalized last year, also provided a perverse incentive for farmers to grow coca, knowing they would later be awarded subsidies. Cocaine production began increasing in 2013, rising steadily every year since. In 2014 the Colombian government ended aerial fumigations in over health concerns.A significant rise in the number of hectares planted with coca, the raw material used in cocaine, had already been reported by the White House, which uses its own measurements. While calculating 180,000 hectares of coca, the US figured the country produced about 700 tonnes of the drug in 2016.",world,3026,49,70

We hope the process of procurement of 1,000 new buses is expedited,? a DTC official said.The government has proposed to procure 1,000 new standard floor buses, but it would take at least a year-and-a-half until they are pressed to service. The matter is yet to be put up in the cabinet after which tender documents would be prepared. Tendering would take at least six months and the next six months will be needed in getting the bus to the city. It has been over four years since buses were inducted to its fleet, even as three attempts to procure new ones have failed owing to tender issues, especially regarding their maintenance. The issue is that the maintenance cost of a bus is so high that manufacturers do not want to take the onus on them, officials said.While there are 3,781 low-floor buses plying in the Capital, it is the 170 standard floor buses that are the oldest (more than 10 years old) and will be condemned in the coming months.The DTC which is one of the oldest State Transport Units (STUs) of India is also worried that if things do not move quickly form here it would be left with only 6,517 employees by 2025 out of which 5052 will be regular drivers alone. Between April, 2016 and March this year, 324 buses were sent to scrap. Last month, 76 buses were condemned.

"In 1950s, playback singers were called ghost voices: Lata","Not enough respect. Not enough attention. Not enough credit. This is what several playback singers in present-day Bollywood feel is on their plate. However, Lata Mangeshkar, the ?Nightingale of India? and Bharat Ratna awardee, says that in her days as a young artiste ? this was when the term ?Bollywood?, a derivative of Hollywood, didn?t even exist ? she never saw the need or the opportunity for media attention.Read: Bollywood doesn?t give us due credit: Playback singers voice their discontent?When I began singing, I didn?t even know about the media, or how to get written about. Mujhe toh sirf gana tha (all I had to do was sing). After my father?s untimely death, I was the sole bread-winner of the family. I had no time to think of anything except how to look after my siblings. The only thing I could do was sing. So I sang. I?d leave early in the morning and commute by train(in Mumbai) from studio to studio, meeting music directors hoping to get work,? recalls Lata tai.All that changed in 1947, when the voice of Lata Mangeshkar exploded in India cinema, wiping away all other singing prototypes.The Nightingale recalls those heady days of initial success with sheer gratitude. ?I think in 1949, I sang around 100-120 songs. The majority of them, from films like Mehboob?s Andaz and Raj Kapoor?s Barsaat, were big hits. In 1949, I had 40-50 chartbusters, including Hawaa mein udta jaye, Jiya beqaraar hai (Barsaat); Aayega aanewala (Mahal); Lara lapaa (Ek Thi Ladki); Chup chup khade ho (Badi Bahen); and Sajan ki galiyan chhod chale (Lahore).?She recalls her relationship with female leads with much fondness: ?During those days, playback singers were called ?ghost voices?, because we really were like ghosts... totally invisible to the public. Even my name was not printed on the records; it was the name of the character that the heroine played that was printed on the record. For the song Ayega aanewala, for Mahal, the name on the record was ?Kamini?, which was [actor] Madhubala?s name in the film.?In the industry, however, Lata Mangeshkar was the name everyone wanted. Apparently, all the major heroines of those times, from Madhubala and Meena Kumari to Nutan and Hema Malini, insisted on only Lataji?s voice for their playback. Some of these actors, like Madhubala, even put this in their contract.Lataji says, ?What you have heard is true. But I never thought of my voice as being bigger than the film. I sang my songs keeping the heroine?s personality in mind. There was no desire to be heard beyond the screen. In fact, for many years, I desisted from doing live concerts.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",general,2627,58,70

I fear I may not be welcome in Trump's US: Stephen Hawking,"Stephen Hawking, the leading British physicist and cosmologist, has said he no longer feels welcome in the US under Donald Trump.Prof Hawking is a recipient of the prestigious US Franklin medal for science and received the presidential medal of freedom from Barack Obama in 2009. Now he has spoken out about his fears for the country?s ?definite swing to a rightwing, more authoritarian approach?.?I would like to visit again and to talk to other scientists, but I fear that I may not be welcome,? he said in an interview with Good Morning Britain on Monday.The 75-year-old Cambridge scientist said he was particularly concerned about Trump?s environment policy.?He should replace Scott Pruitt at the Environment Protection Agency,? he said. ?Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it?s one we can prevent. It affects America badly, so tackling it should win votes for his second term. God forbid.?Hawking has previously described Trump as a demagogue. ?Trump was elected by people who felt disenfranchised by the governing elite in a revolt against globalisation,? he told ITV1?s breakfast programme. ?His priority will be to satisfy his electorate, who are neither liberal nor that well informed.?Hawking said, however, that he saw signs of hope for the world in the rise of women to powerful positions in public life, and he revealed his excitement at the possibility of sending tiny robots into space to investigate earth-like planets trillions of miles away.Asked about the ascent of Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon and Cressida Dick, the new Met police commissioner, he said: ?If we factor in high-powered women in Europe as well, such as Angela Merkel, it seems we are witnessing a seismic shift for women to accede to high-level positions in politics and society. ?But there may still be a gap between those women achieving high public status and those in the private sector. I welcome these signs of women?s liberation.?When asked whether he thought the Nasa space programme should be restarted following the discovery of new planets, Hawking said: ?The recently discovered system of seven Earth-sized planets is 39 light years away. With current technology there is no way we can travel that far. ?The best we can envisage is robotic nanocraft pushed by giant lasers to 20% of the speed of light. These nanocraft weigh a few grams and would take about 240 years to reach their destination and send pictures back. It is feasible and is something that I am very excited about.?On British politics, Hawking said he felt a ?hard Brexit? should be resisted, with the UK retaining strong links with the EU and China. He also said that Labour, which he backed at the 2015 general election, would not win the next election under Jeremy Corbyn. ?He doesn?t come across as a strong leader, and he allowed the media to portray him as a leftwing extremist, which he?s not,? he said. ?It?s no good having the right principles if you never get in power.?",science,2964,58,70

NDA calls for dharna against Bihar minister's insult to PM,"The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has called for a state-wide dharna and protest to demand the ouster of Bihar minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, who called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a ""Naxal"" and a ""Dacoit"" at a Congress-organized Jan Vedna rally in Purnea on February 22. Mastan has since apologised for his comments.By calling for the dharna, the NDA has effectively stepped up pressure on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to sack his ministerial colleague.NDA leaders have fanned out across the state, and will stage dharnas at all district headquarters.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that although Chief Minister Nitish maintains that he neither frames nor protects anyone, he's shielding Mastan and not expelling him from his cabinet. ""The Minister has said that he was not present at the rally on the day, so what is the purpose of him apologising for his tirade against the PM,"" asked senior BJP leader Sushil Modi.The BJP alleged that the nation's sentiments were hurt by the insult to the PM, and have threatened to carry on with their agitation in the street, as well as inside the Assembly. For the last three days, the NDA hasn't allowed the Assembly to function as a result of the Mastan issue. ALSO READ:",general,1232,58,70

"No red carpets, special towels, sofas: Yogi warns officials","Uttar Pradesh chief minister?s office has banned red-carpet welcomes during visits and asked bureaucrats to ?keep it simple?, days after controversy over officials covering up a muddy road with a red carpet during Yogi Adityanath?s visit.?The CM has desired that no red carpets, special towels or particular sofa be arranged during his visits,? read the orders issued by the CM?s principal secretary SP Goyal.The orders have put the officials in a fix and many say they are unsure about what arrangements are to be made in the absence of clear orders. ?It?s a common practice to make seating arrangements for the VIP arrange bouquets for welcome and refreshments. What are we supposed to do now?? a district magistrate from eastern UP asked when told about the orders from the chief minister?s office. On Saturday, controversy erupted after a mud road leading to the house of a slain CRPF sub-inspector in Hamirpur district?s Majhgawa village was covered up by carpets during the CM?s visit. Sources claimed that CM Yogi Adityanath expressed his displeasure over the administration?s failure to ensure proper roads. Officials said the carpet was laid to provide easy access to the house as rain rendered the road slippery.In addition, a luxurious sofa and a cooler were placed and a red carpet laid inside the room where Adityanath spent about 10 minutes. ?I don?t know much but sofa and carpet were set up for the CM,? Saurabh, the son of the martyr, said.Last month, a storm of criticism was unleashed after the administration made similar arrangements for another visit in Deoria but took back the air conditioner and sofa from the family of another slain soldier after Adityanath left the premises. Many questioned whether the move had insulted the dead personnel?s family.Adityanath reportedly took note of the criticism and conveyed his displeasure of the manner in which the whole episode was handled by local officials. Goyal?s written orders, communicated to all commissioners, district magistrates and district police chiefs, have made a specific mention of the Deoria visit.?In the past, there have been instances like the one during Deoria, when ACs, sofa and carpets have been put up for the CM?s visit and removed afterwards. The CM wasn?t happy at the development. He has warned against a repeat of such incidents,? read Goyal?s orders marked?important?.?He wasn?t aware how the matter was handled. Had he known it, it wouldn?t have happened,? an official of the CM?s secretariat said. The official said Adityanath has also asked the party cadre to do away with the practice of welcoming him with bouquets and garlands during his outstation visits.?Instead, he has asked them to welcome him by doing something for the village which he is visiting,? the official said.",general,2782,59,70
"Gold seized from trolleys, toys, ovens at Delhi Airport","With security becoming stricter by the day at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), international criminals are adopting innovative ways to smuggle gold into the country. Custom officials recently busted separate gangs of smugglers who were illegally transporting gold concealed in microwave ovens, toys, wafers and confectionery boxes. This week, officials seized five kilograms of gold in different forms in separate cases worth approximately Rs 1.4 crore. Officials claim two of the smugglers were arrested for illegal transport at the airport. They added that they also seized around a kilogram of gold (996 gm), which was being smuggled as gold foils concealed inside a carton and packing boxes of wafers, confectionery items and toys. GOLD HIDDEN IN METAL BAR OF TROLLEY""The gold foil was so thin and was concealed in such a way that it was difficult to detect it in the X-ray scanning machines,"" said a senior custom officer, adding that a 50-year-old passenger from Dubai was arrested. In another case, smugglers had concealed 1.4 kg gold inside the coil of a microwave oven. ""It is hard to check electronic items as they contain main metal objects,"" the officer said. Over 465 grams of gold was also seized from a passenger coming from Muscat. The gold was hidden in the metal bar of a luggage trolley. According to officials, gold smuggling at the airport has taken a major hit due to demonetisation. Customs officials seized about 240 kg of the yellow metal in 2016-17 fiscal, 190 kg less than the seizure effected in 2015-16. Nearly 355 cases of gold smuggling were reported at the IGIA during the financial year 2015-2016. In these cases, the customs authorities seized 450 kg of gold, valued at a whopping Rs 132 crore (as per prevailing market rates), a senior customs official had said. As a result, about 240 cases of gold smuggling were reported in 2016-17 fiscal. About 260 kg of gold (as against 450 kg seizure in the previous financial year), valued at `76.31 crore (as per the current market rate), was seized by customs officials at the Delhi airport, he said.",world,2097,55,70

New airport device tells if bag had explosives in last 24hrs,"Amid a heightened security threat, the Delhi airport security has new Explosive Trace Detectors (ETD) that can trace if any item in the bag was in contact with any explosive in the past 24 hours. Shaped like a handheld card swipe machine, the new device is used on random passengers coming to Delhi?s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA). Since passengers spend considerable time before the security check at the airport, the CISF stops passengers on a random basis just after they enter the terminal building. Based on profiling, they were taken to a separate enclosure and ETD check was carried on. The device is passed through the baggage and hands of passengers and through colours, it can tell whether the person has packed explosive or any such item. Since passengers and their bags are not checked till they reach the security point, through ETD checks, the CISF wants to ensure better security at the check-in area.Read: Bomb alert! How Delhi airport security failed to detect ?explosives? in a bag?Now, we have an improved version of the device. It can penetrate into the bag and check if there is any trace of any explosive. We don?t need to open the bag in that case. While our staff is highly trained, through better use of technology we try to minimise terror-related incident,? said an official of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Officials said there will be some trace of the explosive on a person?s hand if he has touched it before coming to the airport. At Delhi airport, the CISF has separate enclosures just after the entry gate and passengers with suspicious activities are taken there. ?First their baggage is scanned, then they are frisked and then check with ETD is conducted. The handheld device is quite handy and we have about a dozen of them. They are easy to carry and success rate is also very good,? the official added.The CISF is also planning to use handheld ETD to check passengers with artificial limb so that they do not have to go through the trauma of removing it during security check. Usually ETD is used to check the prosthetic limbs but the CISF says it is meant only for detection of explosives and there is always a chance that a person may try to use prosthetic limb to hide a weapon or for smuggling. Now, the CISF has requested for an upgraded version of ETD so that passengers don?t have to go through the trauma of removing it.",general,2394,60,70
Will not accept modifications in Indus Waters Treaty: Pak,"Fearing that India is buying time to complete two disputed water projects, Pakistan made it clear that it would not accept any modifications or changes to the Indus Waters Treaty after New Delhi said on Friday it was ready to bilaterally resolve its differences with Islamabad over the pact's implementation.The treaty, signed in 1960, gives India control over the three eastern rivers of the Indus basin - the Beas, the Ravi and the Sutlej - while Pakistan has the three western rivers- the Indus, the Chenab and the Jhelum.The IWT also sets up a mechanism, the Permanent Indus Commission, which includes a commissioner from each country.Talking to Dawn here on Friday, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi said: ""Pakistan will not accept any modifications or changes to the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty. Our position is based on the principles enshrined in the treaty. And the treaty must be honoured in...letter and spirit"".Earlier, a spokesman for the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vikas Swarup, told reporters in New Delhi that the resolution process required more time.CONSULTATIONS SHOULD BE GIVEN TIME ""India has always believed that the implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty, which includes the redressal of the technical questions and differences, should be done bilaterally between India and Pakistan,"" he said. ""We believe that these consultations should be given adequate time.""India's request for more time, however, alarmed Pakistan. Islamabad argued that India used the same strategy on previous occasions, completing a project during the dispute and then insisting that since the project was already complete, it could not be modified.Also read: Pakistan 'reminds' India of obligations under water treaty The current dispute revolves around the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants.

As a comedian you may have to look bad too, to justify your character, but good-looking girls often face this conflict...whether they should do it or not,? says Sugandha. The 29-year-old actor says it is also difficult for women to make a mark in the comedy circuit, as they face several limitations. ? My first show Laughter Challenge had some big comedians and to participate with them was a challenge. Being a man, they had no limits at all for comedy. They could perform anything, but being a female, I can?t do everything. Like toilet humour, I can?t do double-meaning comedy and I don?t approve of it either. I don?t even look funny that if I crack a joke on myself, people will laugh. To perform with those limits has been very challenging,? says Sugandha.She stresses on the importance of giving female stand-up comedians proper roles in shows.?Sometimes it would happen that we are doing some gags, the makers of the show would keep the girl for giving cues and give the punches to the men.

The policy of the BJP in Gujarat is - by hook or by crook, come to power by breaking all laws,"" Singhvi said.For the three Rajya Sabha seats of Gujarat, BJP has fielded Amit Shah and Smriti Irani while the Congress has, for the third seat in the state, once again backed Ahmed Patel, the political secretary of Sonia Gandhi.The defections may have a bearing on the election for this seat.Singhvi alleged Congress Gujarat MLA Punabhai Gamit was offered Rs 10 crore by the BJP.

Pak taxi app offers rides with matchmaker 'rishta aunty',"A Pakistan app-based taxi service has launched an unusual add on, offering passengers the chance to share their ride with a marriage matchmaker.Users in Pakistan woke on Wednesday to an unexpected notification from Careem -- an Uber-like taxi hailing app popular in Muslim countries: Have a ?rishta aunty? accompany you during your ride.Rishta aunties, as marriage matchmakers are known in South Asia, keep detailed records of eligible men and women -- from education level and salary, to height, weight and skin tone -- and will set you up with your future spouse, for a fee.Usually portrayed in popular culture as bespectacled women with a clipboard of names and an ancient Nokia mobile, the aunties have had an update thanks to Careem. The ?rishta? service -- which has only been rolled out for two days in two cities in Pakistan -- quickly had the country?s vocal Twitterati on overdrive.?Careem is the halal Tinder now, except that there?s a rishta aunty who?ll do the swiping for you,? joked Twitter user CrazeeGentleman.Careem is the halal Tinder now, except that there's a rishta aunty who'll do the swiping for you#CareemPk #Tinder #Careem #RishtaAunty #WTF pic.twitter.com/a5eq7M17IT?

Staff of Noida district hospital go on strike over pay issue,"Health services were crippled at the district hospital in Sector 30 for four hours on Monday as contractual doctors and paramedical staff went on a strike and protested against the hospital administration for not paying them salaries for the last three months. Nearly 150 doctors and nurses of the hospital took part in the four-hour protest from 8am to 12pm at the district hospital premises. Holding placards, the protesting staff demanded the immediate release of their pending salaries. The wages of the contractual staff are provided by the Noida authority, which are later disbursed by the hospital administration. Due to the protest, patients and permanent staff at the hospital faced inconvenience. The contractual staff members staged a sit-in in front of the main gate. They also demanded that their contract be renewed for another year along with the release of the pending salary by the Noida authority. Chief medical superintendent of district hospital Dr Ajay Aggarwal said, ?We are not responsible for paying their salaries. They have worked here for three months and they resumed their work today (Monday) too after the protest. Their contract has to be renewed by the Noida authority and the authority is planning to do it.? The hospital?s permanent staff strength is 350. It has an overall strength of 500, including the contractual staff. Around 2,500 people daily visit the district hospital in the outpatient department to avail of the treatment. The hospital has a bed capacity of 150. ?There was no impact on the services at the hospital. The staff strength of 350 is enough to take care of patients in a facility the size of the district hospital. Presence of these contractual workers makes hospitals function more smoothly. Even if the Noida authority does not pay them, they cannot do anything about it owing to the conditions mentioned in their contracts,? Dr Aggarwal added. ?We have been performing our duties diligently and it is our right to get our pending salaries. The hospital has maintained the record of our duties and it should stand with us,? said Kavita, a paramedical staff member.",health,2125,60,70
Gaikwad tries different spellings to book Air India tickets,"Air India has alerted its staff to alleged attempts by Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad to circumvent a ban on flying by booking flights with different honorifics and spellings of his name.Sources said that Gaikwad is trying different spellings to confuse AI ticketing staff. The state carrier, which had grounded the MP for abusing and assaulting a 60-year-old Air India manager last week, first cancelled Gaikwad?s Mumbai-Delhi ticket and then another ticket that he had booked from Hyderabad to Delhi on Tuesday. The Sena MP, against whom police have filed an?FIR,?again tried booking a Nagpur-Mumbai-Delhi flight on Wednesday.?Ravindra Gaikwad, R Gaikwad, Prof V Ravindra Gaikwad and Prof Ravindra Gaikwad has been banned in our system as he tried booking using different abbreviation. In some cases he tried changing spellings of Gaikwad also. We are scanning all the details as bookings are made through coupon issued by Parliament,? said an Air India official. Gaikwad had an open ticket with Air India and had booked a flight for Wednesday morning. He blocked a seat on a morning flight from Mumbai to Delhi, which was booked through the Air India call centre. When the airline realised who the passenger was, they cancelled the ticket. Not one to give up, Gaikwad then booked another ticket, this time from Hyderabad to Delhi. However, the airline again came to know who the passenger was and cancelled the ticket once again. On Wednesday, he tried booking through an agent who contacted the AI headquarter in Nagpur. ?A confirmation was sought from headquarter and the travel agent refused to book his ticket,? the official said. Gaikwad abused and assaulted Air India?s duty manager R Sukumar with slippers after being denied business class seat on a Pune-New Delhi Air India flight last Thursday.The 56-year-old MP was then banned by Air India and five private airlines from flying as he refused to apologise for the incident that triggered nationwide outrage.Fellow MPs criticised Gaikwad?s action, and Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said she will take a call if any parliamentarian brought the topic to her notice in the House. He, however, remained defiant and, instead, blamed Sukumar for the incident.He told reporters at Maharashtra Sadan on Thursday morning that he has no regrets. ?Kaahe ka pashchaataap (what is there to repent)? I will not apologise ... he (Sukumar) should come and apologise. Then we will see. A 60-year-old man should know how to behave,? he said.",general,2489,59,70

"Mumbai GST officials working under leaky roofs, no power","Even as some citizens are concerned that the historic goods and services tax (GST) will push prices of several items through the roof, a group of government officials in Mumbai paving the way for the July 1 rollout has been hit by collapsing and leaky ceilings.Around 500 tax officials from the audit wing of the customs and excise department who are now also known as GST officers, are working in shabby and dangerous conditions.Their work is crucial for the longawaited financial reform to deliver on expectations of turning a highly fragmented market with an unwieldy welter of taxes into a true single market for manufactured goods and services.The finance ministry has approved four main GST rate bands: 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent. The move is likely to boost government revenues and the country's sovereign credit profile.However, Rohit Singla, deputy commissioner in the service tax department, got the shock of his life this week when a large chunk of the ceiling crashed inside his cabin while he was working on a computer six feet away.On the same day, almost the entire roof over the conference room in the same Dharavi office collapsed. To make matters worse, one corner of this service tax building has no electricity.""Since the last two days, with a fear of possible short circuit, we are not working on our computers in that corner,"" said an officer. ""It looks funny, but some officers are working on desktops under open umbrellas in a bid to protect themselves from water leakage (after heavy rain) and collapsing ceilings.""Shishir Agnihotri, general secretary of the central excise superintendent association in Mumbai, told Mail Today, ""The situation is quite dangerous and grave. Every year, during monsoon, we have been working in such pathetic conditions where all our desktops, printing machines, fax machines, cables, etc, have to be covered with big plastic sheets.""On Thursday afternoon, senior officials threw a lunch party for all colleagues to celebrate their entering into the new era of GST from July 1. ""In this excitement, nobody is complaining about such poor conditions. But these incidents are affecting our work,"" a senior commissioner said.The two-storey building is owned by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) that receives annual rent from the customs and excise office.""We have been complaining to MSEB to repair the roof and improve our infrastructure, but MSEB is not taking the matter seriously. In fact, this being a disputed property, the board is unwilling to spend any money on such repairs,"" Agnihotri said.Fortunately, the office has no direct interface with traders and companies to tackle GST-related issues. Also, the income tax office in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) also witnessed a roof collapse that left one official injured. ""It was due to poor maintenance despite informing all the concerned authorities since one year. The CPWD and income tax administration are responsible for this incident,"" a senior IT official told Mail Today.",general,3036,56,70
Aadhaar enrolment only at government offices from September,"Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI has asked states to ensure that all enrolments, even those by private agencies, shift to government or municipal premises from external sites by September this year.The move will have a bearing on 25,000 active enrolment centres across India and ensure that they come under direct supervision of the authorities.It is also expected to curb cases of overcharging by private operators as enrolment and updation can be closely monitored by the government, under the new arrangement.Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey has written to the states asking them to identify centres within government premises for enrolment and updation activities by July 31.UIDAI has said the process of shifting enrolment operations to such centres should be completed by August 31, 2017.When contacted, Pandey confirmed this saying the enrolment centres will have to shift from private locations into government premises such as district collectorates, zila parishad offices or municipal offices.They could also be re-located at banks, block offices, taluk offices or other delivery offices run by state government where direct supervision can be ensured.CONVENIENCE FOR RESIDENTSAccording to Pandey, shifting of the enrolment operations into state premises would result in greater convenience for residents.""There are times when people find it difficult to locate enrolment centres and many times they complain to us. Or they may go to a centre and find it closed. At times, there are complaints of overcharging,"" he said adding that tighter control over private agencies will ensure that services are performed strictly as per prescribed norms and there are not deviations.The latest move assumes significance as most government and other services such as benefits, subsidies and services like PAN, GST, bank accounts, passports and property registration now require Aadhaar.Hence, it would be imperative for state governments to provide the facility of enrolments and updates at secure and convenient locations so residents are not inconvenienced.In the letter to all the chief secretaries dated June 28, UIDAI has said that states governments can set up their own enrolment centres within the government or municipal premises with their own personnel as enrolment operators.Alternatively, they can engage UIDAIs empanelled enrolment agencies after reviewing their credentials, provided these centres are set up in government or municipal premises.UIDAI has said at least three centres should be established initially in every block or taluk (within government premises). Thereafter, the number of such centres can be reviewed as per demand.Asked about the implication of the new directive, Pandey said, ""private entrepreneurs will have to find supervised premises or they have to close down business"".The UIDAI is the nodal body responsible for rolling out Aadhaar, the 12-digit biometric identification number, to all residents. Aadhaar has been issued to more than 115 crore people till date.ALSO READ:Furious Supreme Court to government on Aadhaar: How can you make it compulsory?",general,3133,59,70

SC orders clubbing of two trials in Babri Masjid case,"The Supreme Court today ruled that Lal Krishna Advani and several other senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders will face conspiracy charges in the Babri Masjid demolition case. The court also ordered a time-bound trial, ordering that the judge hearing the case shall not be transferred until a judgement is delivered and that there shall be adjournments during the trial except under exceptional circumstances. The Allahabad High Court had earlier ruled in favour of the conspiracy charges being dropped against the veteran BJP leaders, including Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Union minister Uma Bharti. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is prosecuting the Babri demolition cases, had appealed against the high court's order.The Supreme Court today allowed the CBI's appeal and also ordered the clubbing of two trials that are currently going on in the Babri demolition case. The case against Advani, Joshi and Bharti was being heard in a Raebareli court while a Lucknow court was hearing a case against unnamed karsevaks who are accused to actually demolishing the Babri masjid on December 6, 1992. However, the apex court has now ordered the clubbing of the two cases, ruling that the Lucknow court will also rule on the conspiracy charges against Advani, Joshi, Bharti and others. The bench of Justices PC Ghose and RF Nariman also ruled that the trial judge hearing the Babri case will not be transferred until the judgement in the case is delivered. The bench also ruled that Kalyan Singh, currently the governor of Rajasthan, enjoys constitutional immunity and won't be tried right now.

And there is no change in the situation even now, with residents organising protests every other day against the shifting of liquor shops to residential areas in the aftermath of a Supreme Court verdict. In 2016, many protests were held when President?s rule was imposed on Uttarakhand.According to the report, Tamil Nadu came second on the list with 20,450 protests due to the pro-Jallikattu movement that hogged the headlines in the latter part of 2016. While Punjab came third with 11,876 protests, Delhi took the fourth position with 10,039, and Telangana ranked fifth at 8,926. In utter contrast, the northeastern state of Nagaland figured at the bottom with just one protest through 2016.Social activist Anoop Nautiyal admitted that Uttarakhand witnesses a large number of protests every year, most of which arise from factors such as administrative apathy, civic problems and unemployment. ?Even in the past, the Uttarakhand region saw agitations such as the Chipko Andolan (an organised resistance against deforestation in the 1970s). As there is a yawning gap between the protesters and the people in power, people instinctively come out to protest,? he added.Former Uttarakhand director general of police AB Lal said several sections of the society, such as teachers and Anganwadi workers, constantly indulge in demonstrations. ?It does hamper work, but people have the right to protest,? he said.",general,1779,56,70
Haryana plans to install smog-free towers to curb NCR smog,"In its fight against the looming winter smog over the NCR, the Haryana government has decided to follow the Beijing model. The state is in talks with a Holland-based company to set up smogfree towers in Gurugram and Faridabad, the two districts adjoining the national Capital that contribute to nearly one-fifth of air pollution in the region. A smog-free tower is a sevenmetre-high air purifier, the largest in the world, which takes in polluted air particles and expels cleaner air. Beijing, often dubbed as the Asia's smog-chimney, installed several such units in October last year to handle the worsening air condition in the city. ""Haryana surrounds most of the National Capital from south, west and north side and it becomes our responsibility to share the burden of NCR's fight against deadly air pollution,"" Vipul Goel, state industry and environment minister told MAIL TODAY. ""We are aggressively looking at a tech-enabled pollution free environs in Delhi's backyard in Faridabad and Gurugram to start with.""Also Read: Goddess will punish us if we build houses higher than temple, say villagers of this Punjab hamletGoel said he came to know about the smog-free towers installed in Beijing and its positive feedback in China through media articles. The minister got in touch with the Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde who was behind the clean-air project in an industrial park of Chinese capital.Instant results He will be soon visiting Beijing with a team of experts and officials to see on ground. Each air purifier tower, which contains three small in-built purifiers and the outer shell, is effective within the radius of 300 metre to 7 km, claims its manufacturer company.One unit of the giant purifier costs somewhere between `1.8 and `2 crore and it takes about three months to manufacture a single unit. Once on ground, it shows instant results, according to the company.Goel said that he is keen to push for installing the air purifiers in the two districts before the onset of winters. Haryana will also simultaneously employ conventional mode in its fight against pollution and plant about 2.5 crore saplings in the current year. ""We planted about 2.3 lakh trees in just three hours in a similar drive recently,'' he said.Also Read: Mumbai: Three caught with old currency notes; rate of exchange drops drastically However, officials associated with the move, said the final details of the purchase were not yet out. ""We have not decided on the numbers yet, but at least 10-15 in Manesar-Gurugram area alone would be required to bring down smog levels thereâ?¦ and at least three to five in Faridabad at critical junctions would be adequate to start this tech-enabled fight against pollution in NCR,"" a state government official, requesting anonymity, said.Joint action Such a move by Haryana would be a welcome move for Delhi, currently battling worsening air-pollution levels in a decade and between November and January each year, triggering severe respiratory ailments for children and aged. The National Green Tribunal too has raised concerns about the perennial smog blanket every winter all over the NCR and advised the states to thrash out a joint action plan to minimize Delhi's air pollution levels. Experts say that the standing air purifier sucks in 75% of the particles in the nearby air that are dangerous to humans, and then spits out clean air into the surrounding space.

The units are movable and can be reinstalled to a different site. The Haryana government is also mulling a viable solution to end crop burning by local farmers. Crop burning in fields of Haryana and Punjab contribute significantly to rising Delhi's air pollution levels. But with local politics involved, an immediate step is unlikely soon, hinted officials adding, ""but we are putting up 19 ambient air quality monitors to assess the peak pollution time causing the rise in Delhi's air pollution levels"".",politics,4107,58,70

How can you be silent: SC to EC on politicians' life ban,"In a u-turn the Election Commission said on Wednesday that it cannot take a stand on a demand to bar convicted politicians for life from contesting polls, prompting the Supreme Court to criticise the poll panel for shying away from a crucial issue.?Is silence an option for you? You must say either yes or no. How can you be silent? If you are constrained please let us know,? a bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the EC counsel whose submission was a departure from the stand the commission took in its affidavit.In response to a public interest litigation raising the demand, the EC had on April filed an affidavit where it supported the petitioner?s plea. The short affidavit said the commission supported the cause of the petitioner to decriminalise politics. When the court asked the commission?s lawyer, the latter replied: ?The commission is not taking an adversarial stand. We feel the issue (debarring convicted politicians) is in the legislative domain and we have no stand.??If you feel constrained by the legislature then let us know,? the bench shot back at the counsel. The Centre has already made its stand clear on the issue by opposing the petition. In its affidavit in April it had said that the court should not pass orders on the issue as this is a matter best decided by the Parliament.The court also took a swipe at the petitioner for invoking Article 14 (right to equality) in the case. The petitioner had contended that while a convicted bureaucrat and judicial officer lose his or their jobs, the same principle should apply to convicted politicians.?Are you espousing the cause of public servants, complaining of discrimination on the ground of Article 14,? the bench told the petitioner, fixing July 19 to hear the matter again.Under the Representation of the People Act, a politician convicted and sentenced to a jail term of two years or more shall be disqualified from contesting polls for six years from the date of his release from prison after conclusion of the term.The poll panel had said in its affidavit it was ?alive to the issues that concern the conduct of free and fair elections and functioning of healthy democracy and as such asserting for bringing in electoral reforms which further the cause of free and fair elections.?",politics,2274,56,70

The apex court dismissed Karnataka government's review petition to declare former chief minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalithaa a convict in the DA case.The Congress-led Karnataka government also wanted Rs 100 crore fine imposed by the trial court on Jayalalithaa to be recovered by selling her properties. This too was rejected by the Supreme Court. The Karnataka government argued that for the state to recover the Rs 100 crore penalty, the former Tamil Nadu chief minister had to be held guilty.

South Korea seeks rare military talks with North Korea,"South Korea has offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Pyongyang?s first intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this month.Monday?s offer, the first since South Korea elected the moderate Moon Jae-In as president, came as the Red Cross in Seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war.The South?s defence ministry proposed a meeting on Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom, while the Red Cross offered to hold talks on 1 August at the same venue.If the government meeting goes ahead, it will be the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015. Moon?s conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with Pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.The Red Cross said it hoped for a positive response from its counterpart in the North; mooted family reunions in early October would be the first in two years.Millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the peninsula. Many died without getting a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the heavily-fortified border, across which all civilian communication is banned. Only about 60,000 members of divided families are still left in the South. ?North Korea should respond to our sincere proposals if it really seeks peace on the Korean Peninsula,? said Cho Myoung-gyon, Seoul?s unification minister in charge of North Korea affairs.Cho stressed that Seoul ?would not seek collapse of the North or unification through absorbing the North? and urged Pyongyang to restore inter-Korea communication channels, including a shuttered military hotline. Moon, who took power in May, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed North as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table and vowed to play a more active role in global efforts to tame the South?s unpredictable neighbour.But Pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of UN resolutions, most recently on 4 July when it test-fired its first ICBM, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by the US president, Donald Trump, to impose harsher UN sanctions on the country.Washington has also called on China, the North?s sole ally, to put more pressure on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear ambitions, which have advanced rapidly under the North?s leader, Kim Jong-un. ?We make the proposal for a meeting ? aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,? the defence ministry said in a statement.[NEW]The European Union offered European support for South Korean efforts to negotiate with North Korea, but said it was also considering tougher sanctions on Pyongyang following its first intercontinental ballistic missile test.In a statement Monday, the EU?s executive arm condemned the test earlier this month as a ?serious threat to international peace and security? and urged an end to such actions.The latest missile test ? which Kim described as a ?gift? to the Americans ? was seen as a milestone in Pyongyang?s quest to build a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that can hit the US mainland.The proposed meetings, if realised, would be a ?rare opportunity to ease tension that has built up for 10 years?, said Cheong Seong-chang, analyst at the Sejong Institute, a thinktank.?It would at least help let off some steam out of the current crisis, although the North would still maintain that it would not give up its weapons programmes,? he said. The agenda for the meeting could include moves to suspend propaganda campaigns operated on both sides of the border for years, Cheong added. The South?s military has deployed dozens of giant loudspeakers along the tense border to blare out a mix of world news, K-pop songs and other propaganda targeting young North Korean soldiers. It has also occasionally launched giant balloons containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border despite warnings of military retaliation by the North.The North has responded with its own propaganda broadcasts and sent anti-Seoul leaflets via giant balloons across the border.",world,4208,54,70

Guj Congress MLAs get police protection after 6 quit party,"Police protection was given to all the Congress legislators in Gujarat on Monday following Election Commission?s order on a party complaint that the ruling BJP was trying to bribe and coerce its MLAs to defect ahead of the Rajya Sabha election in the state.The security cover was given to nine of the 51 Congress MLAs who stayed back in Gujarat as well as the 42 that the party took to Bengaluru on Friday to shield them from the alleged poaching attempts.The 42 MLAs are staying at a sprawling resort outside the Karnataka capital since six lawmakers of the party resigned in the run-up to the August 8 election in which Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, is contesting.Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said in Bengaluru on Sunday that the legislators staying in Bengaluru are willing to return home if chief minister Vijay Rupani promises their safety.?Two MLAs in Valsad district are being provided police protection as per the EC?s instruction,? said a top police officer. ?Two armed constables were deployed for round-the-clock security.?Lawmakers Ishwar Patel and Jitu Chaudhary could not go to Bengaluru for personal reasons.Security cover was also given to six alleged rebel Congress MLAs, who chose not to join their colleagues in Bengaluru.Raghvji Patel, known to be close to former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela, said: ?I received a call from home that two policemen have arrived, though I haven?t asked for any security cover.?He said he will resign from the Congress soon.The BJP has fielded three candidates ? party chief Amit Shah, Union minister Smriti Irani and Congress turncoat Balwantsinh Rajput.The defectors are believed to be loyal to Vaghela, who quit the Congress on July 21, alleging that some party leaders were conspiring against him.

98 tigers died across the country in 2016: NTCA,"The euphoria over rise in world tiger population early this year may have been misplaced for India as the official data placed before Parliament shows that 98 tigers died in the country till November 16, 2016, a steep 25 per cent rise over last year when 78 deaths were reported.The figures collected by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also take the wind out of government efforts to encourage tiger foundations for sensitising the public and fighting poachers to save the big cats. The environment and forest ministry released Rs1.82-crore grant in 2016 for tiger conservation against Rs30 lakh the previous year.Also Read: Tiger population is rising, but will it get doubled by 2022?""Poaching and poisoning continue to be tigers' worst enemies in the wild,"" environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told Mail Today, explaining the challenges before the government. ""The villagers and some criminal social groups living in or at the fringes of tiger reserves get lured by the money thrown by poaching syndicates of south-east Asia, where there is a huge demand for tiger body partsâ?¦ we are battling that to save our big cats."" Curiously, a high percentage of tiger deaths in the NTCA data remain unexplained, as the official records show ""details awaited"" or ""cases under scrutiny"" as the stated reason for the death. Environmentalists point out that in such cases, the deaths are considered as unnatural, with poaching as the most common motive.Also Read: Tiger population in Pench reserve risen to 53: SFRI reportThe NTCA has also issued an advisory stating that all tiger deaths will be treated as poaching unless and until proven otherwise. Hence the number of poaching cases under such a condition is over 65% of the total tiger deaths reported in 2016.Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for nearly 31 of the 98 deaths this year. The state reported four tiger deaths within a fortnight in November, with one death due to overdose of tranquiliser.POLITICAL NEXUSThe central Indian state, whose tourism arrivals is soaring every year banks heavily on tiger population in its three famous reserves. However, tiger population in Madhya Pradesh has come down from 700 in 2000 to less than half, at 301 in 2016. The state now trails behind Karnataka and Uttarakhand in tiger population.There are many anti-poaching measures initiated by NTCA which coordinate with state forest departments, but to little avail. In fact, poaching cases increased by more than 100 per cent this year. The figures attribute nearly 30 tiger deaths to poaching this year, which is more than double of last year's figure of 14. Top forest officials that Mail Today spoke with expressed helplessness in their fight against poachers and at times cited ""political pressures'' leading to more frequent man-tiger conflict.Some point fingers at archaic resources at hand, immobility against hi-tech and heavilyarmed poachers around Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Some poachers belong to criminal social groups like Pardis, Bahelias, Bawarias and Bongias and are very strongly networked in Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.RED CORRIDORS",general,3140,47,70
Delhi cop masturbates at woman constable in training academy,"A Delhi police cop has been suspended for getting drunk and flashing in front of a woman colleague at the police training college. The incident was reported by the woman officer who informed her seniors on Saturday night.

6-month deadline to probe corruption cases on govt employees,"New Delhi, Jun 5 (PTI) Changing an over 50-year-old rule, the government has set a deadline of six months to complete probe in corruption cases involving its employees. The decision has been taken to speed up the investigation in such cases, most of them pending for quiet a long time. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has amended Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, and decided time-line for critical stages of investigation and enquiry proceedings. The Inquiring Authority should conclude the inquiry and submit its report within a period of six months, says the amended rules. However, an extension for a period not exceeding six months at a time may be allowed for any good and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing by the disciplinary authority, it said. Earlier, there was no time-frame to complete an enquiry. The disciplinary authority shall deliver to a government servant, accused of irregularity and corruption, a copy of the articles of charge, the statement of the imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents and witnesses by which each article or charges is proposed to be sustained, the new rules said. On receipt of such articles of charge, the government servant shall be required to submit his written statement of defence, if he so desires, and also state whether he desires to be heard in person, within a period of 15 days, it said. The time-limit can, however, be extended for a period not exceeding fifteen days. But under no circumstances, the extension of time for filing written statement of defence shall exceed forty-five days from the date of receipt of articles of charge, the rules said. At present, there is no time-limit for submission of the employees statement of defence. The new rules are applicable to all category of employees excluding those in all-India services--Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS)-- and a few other categories of officers. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), in a directive, had last year expressed serious concern over delay in finalising corruption cases and asked all departments to complete these inquiries within a maximum period of six months to keep away ""nothing will change"" notion associated with governance.",general,2326,60,70

JD(U) to contest against AAP in MCD polls,"New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will address two rallies in the national capital ahead of the municipal polls, where JD(U) will contest all the 272 seats, taking on the AAP on its home turf. The partys Delhi in-charge Sanjay Jha announced it an event where few district-level Aam Aadmi Party workers, mainly from east Delhi, joined JD(U), accusing the AAP of neglecting Poorvanchalis in MCD ticket distribution. Jha said JD(U) aims to tap the ""discontent"" among the AAPs poorvanchali voters base. He said the Poorvanchalis here have been ""let down"" by the Arvind Kejriwal government despite having extended every possible backing to it over the last two years. ""Nitish Kumar will address two rallies, one each in north and south Delhi after Holi. The first list of our candidates will be out within a week,"" he said. BJPs decision to appoint Bhojpuri artiste Manoj Tiwari as its Delhi unit chief is also being seen as an attempt to woo the Poorvanchali community, comprising the people from the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring ""fair"" representation of the Poorvanchali population.

Too many shops at Delhi Airport may hinder evacuation: Panel,"Too many shops and restaurants at New Delhi?s Indira Gandhi international airport could jeopardise lives of passengers during an emergency but the airport operator and the government have ignored these safety concerns, a parliamentary panel has concluded.In a draft report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) saw the commercial establishments as a ?big hindrance? to evacuation plans. CISF handles airport security across the country.HT accessed the draft report that was taken up for adoption at the PAC meeting last week.The committee indicted the operators, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and the ministry of civil aviation for what it says was the ?unscientific commercial usage? of the space available for passengers, especially restaurants, retail outlets, duty-free complexes and executive lounges. ?The advice of security agencies is being overlooked for commercial interests,? the report said, while also deprecating ?the complicity? of the civil aviation ministry. ?Members of the committee felt that mishap or disaster could be foreseen given the present state of narrow lanes for movement of passengers?. According to the report, CISF director-general OP Singh raised the issues in letters to the civil aviation ministry but got no response. A delegation of 14 PAC members met Singh during a visit to the airport?s two passenger terminals on March 7.The CISF DG did not give a comment for this story. A ministry spokesperson too did not offer any comment on the PAC?s observations.The PAC also noted that it received feedback from air passengers association of India (APAI) that the experience of flyers is ?nightmarish?: services are expensive, lounges and restrooms are dirty, quality of food sub-par, food courts ill-managed, seating facility at lounges not adequate, and baggage handling counters are inconvenient.?The committee was told that though feedback forms are available, no action is taken on these suggestions/complaints. The committee deplores the laxity of MoCA (ministry of civil aviation) for not taking strict action against the operators in this regard.? The Delhi International Airport Private Ltd (DIAL) is a joint venture consortium led by the GMR Group.A DIAL spokesperson said the airport?s terminals were well within global aviation standards in terms of the proportion of area given out to commercial setups with respect to the overall size of the terminal. ?In the last six years, IGI airport has retained a stellar ranking in Airport Service Quality (ASQ). The airport serves as a model to most other airports in India and worldwide on parameters such as passenger amenities, user friendliness, accessibility, cleanliness, security, entertainment, retail offerings and various other aspects,? the spokesperson said. The two terminals, T1 and T3, serve more than 150,000 passengers every day with nearly 1,200 flights arriving or departing.HT has reported that the domestic terminal, T1, currently handles more passengers than it was designed for. The adoption of the report was deferred, according to sources, due to differences of opinion over the demand by a BJP MP that the panel should recommend a CBI inquiry into the alleged violations of the agreement between DIAL and the airport authority of India. The panel also criticised the airport operators for licensing out land around the terminals without making any study about the passenger movement, their accommodation needs and accessibility to the airport ?which is evident from a large number of hotels cropping up in the area and consequent illegal use of the licensed land for other purposes.? The delegation that visited the airport comprised chairman KV Thomas, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab and Congress MP Shantaram Naik, and 10 other parliamentariansThe panel also expressed reservation against the ?unethical? development fee on passengers, saying that they should not be made to pay for airport infrastructure that is the ?sole responsibility? of DIAL and its shareholders.",general,4065,60,70
"Upset over frivolous petitions in SC, CJI imposes fines","""Whatever the case, we have to read all these pages. My brother judges are young (looking at justices DY Chandrachud and NV Ramana seated with him). They have no problem going through the entire records but I am old. Look at my white beard. After reading all this I feel tired also. So please,"" 65-year-old Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said in the Supreme Court on Friday. The CJI was both upset and angry about the number of frivolous petitions piling up in the apex court, which is already reeling under a backlog of nearly 61,000 cases.Pointing out that he has started imposing heavy costs on such petitioners, he slapped fines of Rs 10 lakh on a Bihar MLA and Rs 1 lakh on a Maharashtra professor in two separate cases.The CJI's remarks came just before the lawyer for the professor said she wanted to withdraw the case, which was filed challenging a circular issued by the Gujarat government. An angry Khehar rebuked the lawyer and allowed her to withdraw the plea but after imposing a Rs 1 lakh fine.BACKLOG""Why do you now want to go back to Gujarat? Why did not this occur to you when you were preparing the petition?"" he said.When the lawyer pleaded for cancelling the cost, CJI Khehar shot back: ""No. This has to stop and only this way it can stop. For years we have not done it. See if you have a good cause we are with you but not for such petitions which take away judicial time.""Millions of cases are pending in India's courts, draining litigants of resources and pointing towards an urgent need for more judges and judicial reforms. Khehar's predecessor, TS Thakur, said last year that the country needs to double the number of judges.The CJI imposed a Rs 10 lakh fine on Bihar MLA Ravindra Singh for indulging in frivolous litigation. The legislator from the state's ruling RJD had challenged in the SC a high court order dismissing his petition, which questioned the veracity of a 23-year old newspaper article. SC said the cost needs to be higher as the representative of the people was found indulging in ""unpardonable"" activity of wasting judicial time. When the MLA's lawyer pleaded that the cost be reduced, the CJI said after hearing the plea for leniency what came to his mind was the story of a hostel mate while he was a college student.ADJOURNMENTSRecounting the incident, the CJI said, ""When a fine of Rs 25 was imposed on him in a case of indiscipline, he had said, 'I belong to a rich family. At least impose a fine of Rs 250.' Likewise you also please say I am an MLA, please impose a fine of Rs 1 crore on me and not mere Rs 10 lakh. Come on,"" the CJI told the MLA's lawyer, raising peals of laughter in the packed courtroom.What apparently set the tone for the CJI's angry mood in the morning hours itself was a petition filed by a car mechanic from Madurai. He was challenging ""illegal additional floors"" in a hospital in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.""Can a car mechanic complain about a hospital? What has he got to do with it? All these are vested interests. If anybody has a good cause we are there to hear it. We are adjourning this matter and in the next hearing if you are not able to prove your bonafides, we will impose costs on you,"" he said.""How many cases we are going to hear which are nonsense and trash? Daily we are seeing such petitions increasing. This is Supreme Court. Do have some respect for us?,"" Khehar questioned.Within hours after taking charge on January 4, CJI Khehar had made his determination to bring down the backlog in the apex court clear by summarily dismissing long-pending frivolous petitions and refusing adjournments in cases. He had begun the practice of disposing of old petitions in a single sitting without granting any adjournments.",general,3705,55,70

Transgender should have option to choose gender: House panel,"As the bill to provide rights to transgender community is being debated at length, Parliament's Standing Committee on Social Justice And Empowerment has recommended that a transgender person should have the option to choose either ""man, woman or transgender"".Earlier, it was recommended in the bill that transgender should be declared as the Third Gender.The Standing Committee's tabled its report on The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016.The Committee headed by Ramesh Bais, also stated that it would like to assure and remind to all the members of transgender community that, ""A historic shift is underway, you are not alone in your struggle for the end of violence and discrimination. It is a shared struggle. Transgender is not an anomaly. It is a part of the spectrum of people's realities. While there is no shame in being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex or even straight - there is a must shame and dishonour in being a homophobe, a transphobe and a bigot.""The Parliamentary Panel found that the present definition of transgender person does not conform with the definition prescribed by the Supreme Court.The Committee felt that the definition of 'transgender person' will be the fulcrum of any legislation on transgender rights and welfare and the whole law would depend on the scope of this definition.The Committee felt that the proposed definition of 'transgender person' in the bill is in stark contrast to global developments, where transgender persons have been granted the right to self determine and to seek benefits according to such identity. More So, it not only violates the fundamental rights to equality, dignity, autonomy, but also freedom of transgender persons guaranteed under Article 14, 19 and 21 of the constitution.Whereas Bill defines Transgender as: Neither Wholly female or wholly male. A combination of female or male.The Standing Committee also recommended a change in Clause 2(c) in bill which defines ''inclusive education'' for transgenders.The committee recommended: Inclusive education means a system of education wherein transgender and gender non-conforming students along with other students learn together without the fear of bullying , singling out and other forms of harassment and the system of teaching and learning is suitably adapted to meet the learning needs of such students.The Standing Committee on Social Justice even recommended that Central and State governments and civil society should adopt measures for generating awareness regarding transgenders.",politics,2546,60,70

"Reliance Jio could earn ?21,300 crore this fiscal: Moody's","New Delhi, Apr 5 (PTI) Newcomer Jios 72 million paid customers are ""credit positive"" for parent Reliance Industries as subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, Moodys Investors Service said today. Moodys calculation shows that Jio will be able to generate revenue of about Rs 213 billion (Rs 21,300 crore) for the current financial year, assuming all 72 million users pay Rs 303 per 28 days between July 2017 and March 2018. On the enrolment of paid subscribers, Moodys Investors Service said, ""This is credit positive as the subscriber enrolment reduces cash flow uncertainty of the telecom business, on which RIL has spent over Rs 1.7 trillion (Rs 1,70,000 crore) over the last six years."" Jio, in February, said it has enrolled 100 million users for its free services that was slated to end on March 31. The company had also announced that it would start charging for services from April 1 and introduced Jio-Prime membership, a discounted set of price plans to incentivise non-paying subscribers to subscribe to paid services. It has now extended by a fortnight the deadline for enrolment to its Jio-Prime plan, and as per its last update has 72 million paid customers. Also, it has announced that all Prime members who subscribe to higher value plans (Rs 303 and above) will enjoy complimentary services for three months and that subscribers will only be charged for services from July. ""... there was uncertainty about the success rate of transitioning non-paying subscribers to paid plans, but that uncertainty has now reduced to a large extent,"" the statement by Moodys said. It further said a significant portion of the 72 million subscribers are expected to opt for Rs 303 plan, given that it is the minimum plan that gives complimentary services for three months. ""However, as the price plan does not require the subscriber to commit beyond the 28 days, they are free to switch at any time after that,"" it said, adding that Prime membership will therefore have to continue to be competitive and maintain service quality to retain customers. The company may have to revisit its price plans beyond April 15 to attract and retain subscribers who do not sign up for the Prime offering, it noted.",general,2238,58,70

Man jailed for 10yrs for sexually assaulting a 14-yr-old boy,"A Delhi court has sentenced a man to 10 years in jail for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old mentally weak boy in east Delhi in 2014.The boy?s father had lodged a complaint with the police in May 13, 2014. A day earlier, the boy had disclosed that the accused, Dinesh, who ran a barber shop, had committed ?galat kaam? (wrong act) with him during several occasions for one week and had threatened him not to disclose it to anyone. An FIR was registered at Krishna Nagar police station and Dinesh was arrested. The court noted that the mental condition of the child victim was weak at the time of the crime. When his statement was recorded, the boy was answering the questions very slowly. He was even not able to tell the exact time in the watch. The boy?s father told the court that his 14-year-old son had the mentality ability of a class 2 student though he was studying in class 5 at the time of the incident. The school authorities also deposed that the boy was a slow learner and cannot cope up with normal school syllabus as he had an intelligence quotient below average. The court noted that the boy preferred to tell about the act and conduct of the accused first to a doctor near his house instead of his family members. ?This behaviour points out that he was not fully capable to think and to take a wise decision about what is wrong or what is right for him and to whom he should rely upon and keep faith. This also clearly leads to the conclusion that victim was somehow a mentally weak child at the commission of the offence,? the court said in its judgment.Dinesh had pleaded not guilty. He claimed he had been falsely implicated in the case. Dinesh said the boy had gone to his shop twice for a hair cut but did not pay money and urinated there. So he had told the boy that he would beat him up if he came again. The boy in his cross examination in the court admitted that he used to throw articles such as combs and scissors on Dinesh whenever he visited his shop. But the court held that this act of the boy did not mean Dinesh could commit a serious and heinous offence by taking advantage of his mentally weak situation. The court said the boy was telling the truth and his statement could be relied upon being trustworthy. It held Dinesh guilty under section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. It also directed the Delhi Legal Service Authority (East) to pay a compensation of R 50,000 to the boy for the mental torture.",general,2469,60,70
"Man accused of raping, killing 8-year-old lynched by mob","In the second such instance in a week, a man was beaten to death in Jharkhand by a mob. The man, accused of raping and killing an eight-year-old, was lynched in the Ramgarh thana of Dumka district. The lynching was separate and unrelated to Thursday's mob killing of a man suspected of carrying beef. That incident took place near Bajartand village in Ramgarh district.

She along with a few others girls from the wedding party went to a nearby lake to take a bath where Hansda, in a drunken state, misbehaved with them, Prabhat Khabar reported. While a few girls managed to run away, Hansda abducted the eight-year-old, took her to the bank of a river outside Jalwe village and allegedly raped her. He is then reported to have killed her and thrown her body among the trees on the river bank. According to Prabhat Khabar, the Hansda went back to the village and joined the wedding party. However, after the eight-year-old did not return, her family started searching for him. In the meantime, the girls who were at the lake where Hansda had misbehaved with them revealed what had happened. Villagers then accosted Hansda who denied that the raped the girl. On Wednesday, villagers again accosted Hansda, tied him to a tree and beat him mercilessly, Prabhat Khabar reported. Hansda reportedly confessed to raping and killing the eight-year-old and then died due to the beating.

Absence of evaluator list delayed Mumbai University results,"Three days before deadline to declare degree college results, MeritTrac, the Bengaluru-based information technology firm carrying out the on-screen assessment of answer sheets, claimed that the University of Mumbai is yet to provide them with a complete list of evaluators causing delay and snags in the assessment process.The firm said they had requested a consolidated list of all evaluators in a particular format, but the university has not given it yet. University officials, however, denied these allegations and claimed that the firm was handed over the required data at the beginning of the project.Speaking to HT, Nagendran S, executive vice-president of MeritTrac said to successfully implement on-screen marking process, one requires complete details about all the evaluators, including the subjects they assess. ?These details were available locally only at colleges and centralised assessment process (CAP) centre. The university didn?t have a consolidated list. We are still receiving evaluator data from varsity officials,? he said.?Unless and until we get the data in a particular format, we can?t generate username and passwords for evaluators. But the list provided by the university was riddled with error,? he said.Rubbishing these claims, Deepak Wasave, in-charge director, board of examination and evaluation at MU, said, ?On the first day of the project, we gave them a list of around 10,000 evaluators. It was their job to put it in the format they wanted,? he said. Wasave, however, accepted that the varsity kept adding new evaluators to the list.He also blamed MeritTrac for slow servers, problems in generating OTPs and mix-up of answer sheets at CAP centres. The company denied the responsibility of these issues. ?There are several factors behind these issues. Sometimes the connectivity of the local area network (LAN) is poor. The generation of OTP also depends on the telecom network. Mix-up of answer sheets occurred due to their mislabelling,? said Nagendran.",general,1994,59,70

J'khand clears draft bill to ban forced religious conversion,"The Raghubar Das government in Jharkhand on Tuesday cleared the draft of an anti-conversion bill which discourages conversion to another religion through force or allurement even as opposition, religious groups and tribal activists criticised the move.The Jharkhand Anti-Conversion bill is likely to be tabled in the upcoming monsoon session of the assembly beginning August 8, home department sources said.As per the draft, anyone found guilty of forcibly converting ones religion through force or allurement, would be liable for punishment that includes jail term of three years and fine Rs 50,000.Individuals voluntarily opting to switch to another religion would have to inform the local deputy commissioner/collector about the reasons and the place of conversion, failing which he will be liable for prosecution and punishment.As per the cabinet decision, if forced conversion is found against minor, tribal, SC or woman, the culprit would be liable for imprisonment of up to four years and fine of Rs 1 lakh.If passed, Jharkhand would become the sixth Indian state to have an ?anti-conversion law? following Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.Jharkhand Population Stats26% of Jharkhand population is tribalOf them, 39 % claim to be Hindus while 14.5 % follow ChristianityAs per 2011 census, Christian population rose by 29.7%, Muslims by 28.4% and Hindus by 21%Jharkhand government has identified 106 Christian affiliate NGOs that are misusing government money for religious conversionEver since the BJP government came to power with a full majority in December 2014, it has stepped up efforts to check religious conversion, specifically of tribals, who constitute 26% of the state?s total population.The trigger for the proposed bill came early this year when the government of India released the population census. As per the 2011 census, the Christian population in Jharkhand rose by a whopping 29.7% in the last 10 years followed by that of Muslims 28.4%, while Hindu population rose by 21%.To begin with, the government curbed the flow of government funds to various Christian affiliate social organisations and development groups that were allegedly misusing government money to convert people.Chief minister Das has voiced his concerns over the conversion of tribals through force or allurement on several occasions, and asked gullible tribals to protect their culture and religious practices at any cost.?Those indulging in forcible religious conversion would not be spared,? Das had said at a couple of public meetings in Gumla and Khunti, urging tribals not to fall prey to the baits of Christian missionary organisations.Christian and pro-Christian tribal groups had then raised objections over the CM?s remarks. Senior IAS officer Vandana Dadel, a tribal and practicing Catholic, shared her anguish on Facebook over the government?s over-indulgence in checking religious conversions, which, she said, is an individual?s choice and hence, should be left to the people.Christian groups have again upped their ante, this time, against the proposed legislation.?The BJP government?s intentions are not good. It wants to divide the tribals to further their political agenda in preparations for the next election,? said Prem Chand Murmu, president of Adivasi Budhijivi Manch (ABM).?Conversion is an individual choice.

60% shortfall in releasing central funds for Assam floods,"Even as Assam reels under floods a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report revealed a shortfall of 60% in the release of central funds for the state?s flood management projects.The centre was supposed to release R. 2,043.19 crore between 2007-08 and 2015-16 for 141 projects but only released R. 812.22 crore. The state government fared worse, releasing only 16% of the allocated budget provision. ?Insufficient flow of fund adversely affected the implementation of schemes,? the CAG report concluded.In Assam 14 districts have been inundated with floods, over 2 lakh people are displaced and over 70 people have lost their lives, in this year alone. Floods are a natural phenomena in these areas because excessive monsoon rains cause flooding regularly, but shoddy preparedness has only made the situation worse.?There were huge delays in completion of River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas projects which were long term solutions for the flood problems of Assam, North Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh,? the report found. ?There were discrepancies in execution of works like irregular award of work, splitting of tenders, payment at higher rates.? The CAG report evaluated 206 Flood Management Programme projects, 38 flood forecasting stations, 49 River Management Activities and works related to Border Area projects and 68 large dams in 17 states and Union Territories between 2007 and 2016. They found ?inordinate delays? in almost a quarter of the projects, in release of funds and ultimately completion of projects ranging from 10 months to 13 years.In none of the 17 states were flood prone areas even assessed scientifically.

"Delhi's AIIMS, Safdarjung to be declared no-hawker zone","Dozens of street vendors will have to take their wares elsewhere as authorities in Delhi are gearing up to clear the perennial congestion near the neighbouring hospitals AIIMS and Safdarjung.The area will be turned into a ""no hawker zone"" as the encroachers cripple traffic movement and also get in the way of emergency vehicles.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has directed the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) chairman to take control of the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg stretches from the Public Works Department (PWD).The move by the L-G follows repeated complaints from Safdarjung Hospital authorities that doctors and patients get delayed in reaching the institute on time as they get stuck in traffic outside.Dr AK Rai, director of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, ""I have been getting complaints from patients' relatives, doctors and other hospital staff on being late in reaching the hospital when it's the need of the hour. Every day, it is the same issue and one gets stuck in traffic for nearly 20 minutes.""A meeting was held on Monday with the Safdarjung director and Naresh Kumar, the civic council chief.""The NDMC chairman formed a committee including officials and experts from the council, Delhi traffic police and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). These two road stretches - Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg -would be now declared as no-hawker zone strictly,"" Dr Rai informed.The emergency wards of both the hospitals are crowded with critically ill and trauma patients every day and ambulances coming from the Ring Road side always get stuck because it is highly congested during peak hours, said a doctor.""For us, the main issue is to improve the traffic movement,"" Naresh Kumar told Mail Today. ""We are looking for temporary, medium and long-term solutions. Delhi traffic police will manage the traffic movement at the bus and auto-rickshaw stands."" ""Moreover, most of the space on the road is occupied by private cabs. At the time of monsoon, there should be no traffic jam at Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg. All unauthorised hawkers will be removed from the entire zone,"" Kumar added.Heavy rains cause massive waterlogging at the entire stretch every year. Hordes of street vendors and hawkers are running their business illegally in the area and blocking the way, said Kumar.""Our main focus is to improve the road infrastructure. From now onwards, Aurobindo Marg is under the jurisdiction of NDMC,"" he iterated.The Safdarjung Hospital director too pointed out that a rapid rise in the number of illegal vendors has created a bottleneck outside the hospital.""It is advisable to shift the bus stop on Ring Road side and shops in the subway of the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg. Proper pedestrian path should be made,"" said Dr Rai.Echoing similar views, Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of AIIMS, underscored the importance of streamlining traffic movement in such a manner that patients and doctors coming to the hospital get a smooth passage and pedestrians and other commuters too do not face hassles.ALSO READ |",general,3043,55,70

Italian restaurant offers discount for well-behaved children,"An Italian restaurateur fed up with his customers? lunches being interrupted by rowdy children has come up with a novel solution: a discount for well-behaved families.Antonio Ferrari, who owns a wine bar in the northern city of Padua that caters to families on Sundays, came up with the idea when he spotted a party of 11 at one of his tables, including five children sitting ?with much composure?.Ferrari rewarded the group with a 5% sconto, and has since bestowed the same discount on two other families with well-mannered children.Ferrari told the Guardian he estimated about 30% of parents did not know how to handle their children at lunchtime, and that too often children run around the restaurant and bother other customers, forcing his waiting staff to swerve to avoid them.Long family lunches, sometimes stretching to three hours, are still an honoured culinary and social tradition in Italy, though less prevalent than they once were. Usually the meal involves an antipasto ? bruschetta or platters of prosciutto are fairly typical ? and then a pasta dish, followed by a meat dish and then vegetables.Unlike the disciplined French children portrayed by Pamela Druckerman in her book Bringing up Bébé who sit quietly through restaurant meals as their parents engage in adult conversation, Italian families are stereotypically more rowdy, with loud behaviour often indulged by parents who see it as as a normal childhood phenomenon. Ferrari ? who does not have children ? was at pains to point out that his intention was not to be too judgmental, telling Corriere della Sera: ?I imagine how difficult parenting is today.?Nevertheless, he thought something had to be done to rein-in children splashing water in the restaurant?s bathrooms and bothering other customers by running around tables.He recalled some parents telling him his restaurant was essentially public, and that they could do what they want. But he added: ?I?m responsible for what happens in it.?The party who earned the coveted discount were delighted by the news and left a ?30 (£25) tip, Ferrari said.",world,2080,60,70

"Rashtrapati Bhavan took 17 years to build, has 340 rooms","Ram Nath Kovind, the BJP's candidate for the presidential election, secured an easy win against Opposition pick Meira Kumar today to be elected as the 14th President of India. The former Bihar governor, who was born in Kanpur, will take the oath of office on July 25 and move to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee will leave for his new residence at 10, Rajaji Marg.When Ram Nath Kovind enters Rashtrapati Bhavan, he will step into a building that was transformed from an imperial mansion into an institution of democracy on January 26, 1950. When Dr Rajendra Prasad occupied the building as country's first President, the Viceroy's House was renamed as Rashtrapati Bhavan. THE MAKING OF RASHTRAPATI BHAVANThe initial amount sanctioned for the construction of Rashtrapati Bhavan was 400,000 pounds. It took 17 years to finish building the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 1929 and by then the construction cost had escalated to 877,136 pounds (In 1929, this was Rs 1.28 crore approx).Add to that the cost of constructing Mughal Garden and the staff quarters, the total cost of building the entire Rashtrapati Bhavan complex stood at Rs 1.4 crore approx.The Rashtrapati Bhavan has a total of 340 rooms spread on four floors. The mansion has a floor area of 200,000 square feet and was built with 700 million bricks and three million cubic feet of stone. The Rashtrapati Bhavan was built using almost no steel. THE INDO-EUROPEAN ARCHITECTUREEdwin Lutyens acknowledged the influence of Roman architecture in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Yet, the building also reflects various motifs from Indian architecture, such as chhatris and jaalis. Temple bells have been used in the pillars of Rashtrapati Bhavan, an idea that came from a Jain temple in Moodabidri in Karnataka. THE MUGHAL GARDENThe Mughal Garden boasts of 250 varieties of roses, making it one of the best rose gardens in the world. Ram Nath Kovind will organise 'At Homes' on Republic Day and Independence Day every year in the Central Lawn.The lawns in the main garden are covered with 'Doob' grass which was originally brought from Belvedere Estate in Kolkata. Peacocks are a regular sight at the Mughal Garden, while once in a while a cormorant can also be spotted. PRESIDENT's BODYGUARDThe President's Bodyguard was raised in 1773 by then Governor Warren Hastings in Benares. The regiment was formed as a select cavalry unit with the role to ""act as bodyguard to the governor in peace and to accompany him as Commander-in-Chief in battle"". The President's Bodyguard excel in ceremonial procedures, are trained as combat paratroopers and armoured vehicle crewmen.THE PRESIDENTIAL RETREATSThe President of India has two retreats in the country--one in Mashobra, Shimla and the other in Bolarum, Hyderabad. Ram Nath Kovind, who was denied entry to the Retreat Building in Shimla two months ago, is set to be the custodian of the presidential retreat. The presidential retreat in Shimla is an entirely wooden structure and is located on the hill top of Mashobra. The presidential retreat in Hyderabad, called the Rashtrapati Nilayam, is an 1860-built building with 11 rooms. The building was taken over from the Nizam of Hyderabad after Independence and handed over to President's secretariat. The President stays at both the retreats at least once in a year.

Trump blames NYT for foiling bid to capture ISIS leader,"US?President Donald Trump on Saturday attacked The New York Times and its ?sick agenda,? alleging that one of the paper?s reports thwarted a US bid to take out Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.?The Failing New York Times foiled US attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, Al-Baghdadi. Their sick agenda over National Security,? Trump wrote in one of a barrage of early morning tweets.Trump did not expand on his charge against The Times, or explain what revelation by the daily is supposed to have hampered Baghdadi?s capture. The New York Times told the Politico news site in a statement: ?We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet.?US media suggested that Trump may have been referring to a Fox News report about comments made by a top general at a security conference on Friday in Aspen, Colorado.At that gathering, General Tony Thomas -- head of the US military?s Special Operations Command -- reportedly said that American forces at one point came ?particularly close? to Baghdadi after a 2015 raid recovered information about the Islamic State group.Fox News reported that Thomas said US troops had ?a very good lead,? on the IS leader?s whereabouts. ?Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,? Thomas reportedly said at the forum.US Secretary of Defence James Mattis said Friday that he believes Baghdadi is still alive, following various claims in recent months that he has been killed.?We are going after him, but we assume he is alive,? the Pentagon chief said.There have been persistent rumors that Baghdadi has died in recent months.With a $25 million US bounty on his head, Baghdadi has kept a low profile but is rumored to move regularly throughout IS-held territory in Iraq and Syria.The Iraqi -- nicknamed ?The Ghost? -- has not been seen since making his only known public appearance as ?caliph? in 2014 at the Grand Mosque of Al-Nuri in Mosul, which was destroyed in the battle for Iraq?s second city.The Times has become a favorite Trump target despite his penchant for reaching out to the daily, including this week, when he gave its reporters a major interview in which he criticized his own Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In Saturday?s tweetstorm, Trump railed against The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for its ?illegal leaks.??A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G.

Give NRIs e-voting rights: Supreme Court directs Centre,"In a big leap towards permitting a 25 million-strong NRI population to vote in Indian elections from abroad, the Supreme Court on Friday said it had to be done at any cost, and asked the Modi government to decide within one week how it plans to go about it.A bench of chief justice J S Khehar and justice D Y Chandrachud was angry the government had not made the necessary amendments (of the Act or Rules) in the Representation Of Peoples Act to allow the voting by NRIs, despite repeated assurances to the court. ""This is a petition of 2014. Every year you keep saying 'we will amend'. You said this in 2014, 15, 16 and again ... this is not the way your government runs,"" an angry CJI Khehar told the Central government's counsel.The court was hearing PILs filed by two NRIs - Shamsheer V P, an NRI from Kerala, and Nagender Chindam, Chairman of the UK-based Pravasi Bharat - seeking the voting rights. ""The US lets you vote from space. Texas laws have allowed astronauts the right to vote when on a space mission. Here, NRIs are pleading for it,"" said Chindam.Until now, due to the high cost of travel and time involved, only a minuscule population of NRIs came to India to cast vote. E-voting will allow them to vote without having to fly during elections. In e-voting, a blank postal ballot paper is emailed to the voter, who has to then fill it and mail it by post to their constituency. At a previous hearing, the government had accepted the Election Commission's (EC) view that the option of voting through an epostal ballot system could be considered for the NRIs.",general,1573,55,70

Get back private sector's animal spirit: Uday Kotak to govt,"Mumbai, Mar 26 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak has said the BJPs win in the recent state polls is positive for economic reforms and the government should now focus on re-activating ""animal spirits"" of the private sector to invest. ""I think we just need to make sure that we are focused on growing the economy, getting the private sectors animal spirits back and that will create jobs,"" Kotak told PTI over the weekend. Terming BJPs landslide victory in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh as a positive development, Kotak said it is a ""big signal"" for stability and continuity in economic policies. A two-thirds majority in the countrys most populous state, that sends the maximum number of Parliamentarians (80 to the Lower House and 30 to the Upper House, where Opposition Congress is in majority), will help BJP gain upper hand after the 2018 elections to the Rajya Sabha. The Narendra Modi government has been facing stiff opposition in getting crucial bills passed in the Rajya Sabha due to lack of adequate numbers. The BJP and allies have won 324 seats in the 403- member UP assembly.

Counting began at 8 am at 54 centres in 27 locations where the state election commission had deployed more than 14,000 officials.

2 injured in shootout at Panchayat's bid to settle rape case,"Two persons were injured as a group of residents opened fire at a neighbourhood in Loni town of Ghaziabad on the wee hours of Friday, when a local panchayat was trying to settle an alleged ?rape? case.According to Loni police, a 23-year-old married man, identified as Arif, entered the house of a 20-year-old woman during the wee hours on Friday and allegedly raped her. The family members were asleep on the roof of the rented house, when the incident happened. Arif was caught when tenants of neighbouring houses woke up hearing the noise.After the man was caught, the locals gathered to discuss the issue, as there were speculations that Arif and the woman were in a relationship and he had entered the house with the woman?s consent. While a local panchayat discussed whether to get the two married or to lodge a police complaint against Arif, one of the neighbours rang up the police. ?Attracting police attention to the incident led to resentment among the locals.

6-week training compulsory for engg diploma in Maharashtra,"With the demand for diploma engineering courses dwindling in the past few years, the Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education (MSBTE) has decided to make the curriculum more suited to industry needs. As part of the new ?I Scheme? curriculum, which will replace the existing ?G Scheme? curriculum from the upcoming academic year, the state board has introduced a mandatory six-week internship in the last year of the diploma. The students will also receive hands-on training throughout the three-year course by working on ?mini projects?.?The curriculum provides for industry-relevant skills to the students. It will focus more on practical training than theoretical knowledge?, said Vinod Mohitkar, secretary, MSBTE. He added that declining number of students in diploma programmes was one of the considerations while designing the new curriculum.So far, the theory aspect of engineering has been the major component of all diploma programmes. Industry apprenticeship was limited to the institutes offering ?sandwich pattern? programmes, where two semesters of industrial training was sandwiched between classroom teaching. ?I scheme? is an outcome-based curriculum pattern, with specific sets of goals defined for the each programme. It follows a variation of choice-based credit system (CBCS), which allows students to choose from a list of subjects. ?The students can specialise in an area of their choice,? said Mohitkar.The board has also decided to prepare learning resources such as lab manuals and sample question papers, to ensure uniform and effective implementation of the curriculum.Gopakumaran Thampi, principal, Thadomal Shahani College of Engineering, said that the new curriculum has been designed to encourage students to join the industry, instead of opting for higher education. ?Many students treat the diploma as a stepping stone for a degree course. The curriculum will ensure that the students intuitively learn skills required in the industry, rather than seeking knowledge,? he said.HT, on Saturday, reported that, in the last two years, the number of students applying for diploma courses has dipped by 38%, as the students increasingly prefer pursuing degree engineering after junior college or joining a vocational courses at an Industrial Training Institute.Thampi believes that the board will have to do more than just revise the curriculum if it wants more students to join polytechnics. ?The diploma holders are looked down upon in the society. As a result, most of the students opt for degree engineering. The board needs to glamourise and market diploma programmes and explain their importance in nation building,? he said.How ?I Scheme? curriculum was developedMaharashtra State Board of Technical Education (MSBTE) had begun the exercise to revise the curriculum in October 2015, when it convened a meeting of around 60 industry experts in Pune to gauge their expectations from diploma holders, in terms of knowledge skills and attitudes. The National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTTR), Bhopal was appointed as an education consultant for this project. MSBTE, then, prepared two separate questionnaires to seek inputs from industries and alumni of polytechnics in the state.The feedback from around 300 industries and several alumni were collected, tabulated and analysed, using statistical tools.The requirement of industry were prioritised in terms of various categories of subjects such as basic science, engineering science, engineering technology, core technology and applied technology.Based on this data, the structure of 18 engineering diploma programmes, including mechanical, civil, computer and electrical engineering, were developed. The final drafts were further fine-tuned after running them by industries again.Fewer takers for engineering diplomaThis year, the state?s directorate of technical education (DTE) received around 65,406 applications, 185 less than 80,000 applications received in academic year 2016-17. A similar rate of drop - 20% - was witnessed between 2016-17 and 2015-16, when close to a lakh students had applied for the diploma courses.",general,4145,58,70
Stand by triple talaq like Tamils did for Jallikattu: Owaisi,"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Muslims to stand up in support of triple talaq, saying people of the community should draw inspiration from the way the Tamils fought against the ban on hugely popular bull-taming sport jallikattu. Owaisi said that like the Tamils, Muslims also have their own culture and they should derive inspiration from the Tamil protests which he said made even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bow down. Owaisi added that nobody should interfere with their customs of marriage and triple talaq.""In Tamil Nadu, people protested in lakhs to fight for their tradition. Modi had to bow in front of them. Are we any less than them? We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do,"" Owaisi said. Owaisi's statement has come at a time when the Supreme Court is looking into the constitutional validity of triple talaq after several women's groups challenged the practice.WHY THE CONTROVERSYWhile the Allahabad High Court termed triple talaq unconstitutional in December, 2016, the Supreme Court is separately hearing another plea filed by Saira Bano who has challenged the three rules related to Niqah (wedding). These rules are: Talaq-e-Bidat, Niqah Halala and a man's right to have four wives.TALAQ-E-BIDATTalaq-e-Bidat is the practice which gives a man the right to divorce to his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times without waiting for her consent on the matter.In the Islamic tradition, some conditions were imposed for Talaq-e-Bidat. A man can divorce his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times during the period of a Tuhar, that is, the time period of two menstruation cycles.This could be done in one sitting or spread over the specified period. Under Talaq-e-Bidat, the wife's consent is not required for the separation.NIQAH HALALAThere have been instances where men have uttered 'talaq' three times in an inebriated state or in a fit of rage and have later wanted to revert to normal married life. However, the practice of Niqah Halala prevents the reversal of the triple talaq.According to the practice of Niqah Halala, a man is not allowed to marry the same woman after divorce even if both the partners are willing. Such a niqah is considered haraam (illegal).Niqah Halala requires that the divorced woman marry some other man and after obtaining divorce from her second husband, she can remarry her first husband the second time.WATCH: Owaisi urges Muslims to fight for triple talaq the way Tamils fought for jallikattu",general,2565,60,70

Working woman not entitled to maintenance: Bombay HC,"The Bombay high court, in a recent order, held that a ?working woman,? who is ?capable of maintaining and sustaining herself,? should not be entitled to receiving maintenance from her estranged spouse.A bench of Justices RM Savant and Sadhana Jadhav were hearing a plea filed by a television actress, who had challenged a family court order denying her any interim maintenance.The petitioner separated from her husband, who is also a television actor, in 2010. While their divorce proceedings are currently pending in the family court, she had sought that considering that her husband had not paid her any maintenance amount in the years since their separation, the family court award her an interim maintenance amount of rupees 50,000 each month till the divorce decree is granted.Her husband, meanwhile, had opposed her demand for interim maintenance saying that while he had worked in TV shows produced by Balaji telefilms between 2005 and 2010, since then, he hadn?t had a stable source of income. He had claimed that he now works ?as and when he gets an assignment.?The family court had accordingly held that since both the parties had failed to produce any documentary evidence of the money that they were making annually, the issue of maintenance would have to be decided upon at a later stage, after examination and cross-examination.In the high court, however, the woman claimed that she wasn?t part of any TV shows or films currently and thus, had no money of her own. She claimed that for her survival, she was ?totally dependent upon her aging parents.? She also told the court that her husband had signed a Telegu movie and thus, made a lot of money. He, thus, be directed to pay her some interim maintenance.The husband, meanwhile, told HC that when he and his wife used to stay together, he was the one who paid for all expenses, including the expenses incurred by the petitioner?s ?parents,? and the money needed to maintain her ?pet.?Taking note of these submissions, the high court held that the mere fact that the petitioner was not part of any TV shows or films currently, did not entitle her to interim maintenance. It held that considering that she was an actor who had been working for the past several years, and that she was ?capable of finding work in the future, and thus, sustaining herself,? it did not deem it fit to interfere with the family court?s order.",general,2387,52,70

Rescue workers said they ended operations at 5.30pm on Wednesday after all residents were accounted for.

At 10.45am on Tuesday, the building caved in with women, senior citizens and infants. The dead included two infants ? a three-month-old and 1-year-old ? and four senior citizens. The rescue ops began around 11.23am. The fire brigade called it a level 4 emergency and deployed 14 fire engines, two rescue vans and ambulances to the spot. As rescue operations continued, the scale of the tragedy came to light ? by 3pm, 12 people were removed from the debris, four of whom were declared dead; 12 hours after the building collapsed, the toll had risen to 12. As people were found, they were rushed to the nearby Shantiniketan hospital or the Rajawadi hospital. But the survivors and families of those still missing held on to hope, as neighbours and residents of the nearby societies helped search for people, served tea and biscuits and comforted the families. For one family, the prayers paid off. After 16 hours of being trapped under the rubble, the fire brigade pulled out Rajesh Doshi, a 57-year-old businessman. Doshi luckily had his phone with him when the building came crashing down and he used it to help the rescuers find him.READ:??Sena man arrested for Ghatkopar building collapse named in 6 illegal construction cases in Mumbai?The rescue operations continued through the night, and by 7.30am, 17 people were declared dead.

Usain Bolt participates in his first-ever mixed gender relay,"The Nitro Series promised to make athletics a show and the sport's ultimate show-man Usain Bolt capped its first meeting in Melbourne on Saturday by propelling his team of international ""All-Stars"" to a crowd-pleasing win in the 4x100 metres relay.Taking the baton from Olympic gold medal-winning team mate Asafa Powell, Jamaican Bolt powered down the second leg at Lakeside Stadium before Americans Jenna Prandini and Jeneba Tarmoh completed the win in the mixed team event ahead of Japan and Australia.Bolt's first run of the year and first in Australia brought the curtain down on opening night of the Series, which has pledged to ""revolutionise"" athletics with a team-based event that borrows heavily from the formula of sport and entertainment which has underpinned Twenty20 cricket's considerable success.With athletics struggling to maintain a profile outside of the Olympics and rocked by major doping and corruption scandals in recent years, organisers hope the series can reinvigorate the sport by shaking up the traditional schedule of events - and sprinkling some star-dust from marquee man Bolt.Bolt, who completed a ""treble treble"" of 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay Olympic titles at the 2016 Rio Games, was paid a seven-figure appearance fee to commit to all three meetings in the inaugural series in Melbourne this month and given a stake in the company running the event.He fulfilled his role as athletics' great entertainer, galloping on to the field before the meeting as flame cannons shot fireballs into the air and dancing to thumping pop music.""Tonight is the first night, we just want to do something different,"" Bolt told reporters as a crowd of hundreds of spectators craned necks to capture a glimpse.""I've never handed (a baton) over to a girl. For me that was exciting.""Everybody was having fun, everyone was trying to support their team mates.""Bolt's appearance helped secure a clutch of big names for the event, with American former Olympic 400m hurdles champion Kerron Clement running in his All-Stars team who won the overall event ahead of Australia.Christine Ohuruogu, the 2008 Olympic 400m champion, captained Team England.With mixed team events, a 2x300m relay and an elimination mile in which runners were knocked out progressively, the meeting carried on with troupes of dancers gyrating to electronic music in front of an enthusiastic crowd of about 7,000.SIMILAR SPECTACLEIt was a spectacle similar to any of the 'Big Bash' Twenty20 matches played at the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground.But whereas Twenty20 competitions are underpinned by the support of dozens of high-profile players, Bolt carries a lot of the burden on his own shoulders.""It's not an understatement to say that we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Usain Bolt and his management,"" Athletics Australia president Mark Arbib told Reuters before the meeting.""Usain Bolt and (agent) Ricky Simms have not just put their name to it, and are not just taking part, they have taken a stake in the business itself.""They've promoted it, selected the Bolt All-Star team, they've put their own IP (intellectual property) into the All-Stars, they're building a significant commercial asset.""Like a number of federations across the globe, Athletics Australia has battled to arrest declining crowds and interest in the sport, initially conceiving of the series as helping to boost the low profile of the nation's top athletes.But Bolt's signature had proven a ""game-changer"", Arbib, a former federal sports minister, said.It had secured a prime-time broadcast for a local athletics meeting for the first time in nearly a decade while attracting key corporate backers.Among them, Kerry Stokes, owner of the series' host broadcaster Seven West Media, had invested A$1 million ($768,000) of his own funds, the Australian Financial Review newspaper reported.The crowd was lower than the 8,500 stadium capacity but total tickets sold over the three nights of the series had comfortably outstripped those sold for the entire programme of national athletics events last year.If ambition was an Olympic sport, organisers could already crown themselves gold medal winners.",entertainment,4159,60,70

Angelo Mathews steps down as Sri Lanka captain,"Angelo Mathews has stepped down as Sri Lanka skipper across all three formats after his team lost the ODI series against Zimbabwe 2-3. This was Sri Lanka?s first-ever loss to Zimbabwe in a bilateral series and it continued their torrid run in 2017.Following Sri Lanka?s three-wicket loss to Zimbabwe in the final ODI at Hambantota which led to their series loss, Mathews had said that he was reconsidering his decision to be captain of Sri Lanka. ?It?s one of the lowest points in my career, and a hard one to swallow.

People introduced me as SBI Chairperson: Ex-SEBI Chairman,"New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) Capital markets watchdog SEBI may be among Indias most powerful regulators today but there was a time when people used to introduce its former chief U K Sinha as Chairman of SBI -- a similar sounding acronym but of State Bank of India. ""At the start of my tenure at SEBI, people would introduce me as the chairperson of SBI, the State Bank of India (the country?s largest bank with a far flung branch network). Today, you go to a small village in India and they know SEBI,"" says Sinha, who retired as SEBI Chairman last week after a six-year tenure -- the second largest in nearly three decades of existence of the regulatory body. Sinhas remarks are part of a detailed case study on the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) done by Professor Suraj Srinivasan of the Harvard Business School. The study titled Securities Exchange Board of India: Developing and Regulating India?s Capital Markets has been done by Suraj along with research associate Radhika Kak.

SEBIs tough actions against several large corporates even prompted some in recent years to call the regulator a dragon and of acting like an activist.",general,1748,57,70

Changes in the old Rs 500 note, which was launched in 1987, were carried out more than a decade ago.The newly introduced notes had no additional security features and were similar to those in the old Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, officials said.11 OF 17 SECURITY FEATURES REPLICATEDA close look by the investigators on some of the recently seized fake notes found that at least 11 of the 17 security features in the new Rs 2,000 notes had been replicated.These included the transparent area, watermark, Ashoka Pillar emblem, the letters Rs 2000 on the left, the guarantee clause with the Reserve Bank of India Governors signature and the denomination number in Devanagari on the front, officials said.Besides, the motif of Chandrayaan, the Swachh Bharat logo and the year of printing had been copied on the reverse side. Although the print and paper quality of the seized counterfeits was poor, they resembled genuine notes.The officials said the change of security features of currency notes in every 3-4 years will lead to curbing of counterfeiting to a great extent.Those who were arrested recently along with fake notes with face value of Rs 2,000 have told investigators that the notes were printed in Pakistan with the help of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and had been smuggled into the country through Bangladesh, the officials claimed.A study conducted by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2016 pegged the value of fake Indian currency notes in circulation at Rs 400 crore.",general,2426,59,70
Kapil Mishra assaulted by AAP MLAs inside Delhi Assembly,"Former minister Kapil Mishra was beaten up by fellow AAP MLAs inside the Delhi Assembly today as he tried to raise slogans against CM Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendra Jain. Speaking to India Today, Kapil Mishra said the assault was ordered by Kejriwal and dared the AAP chief to come out clean on the allegations levelled against him. Television images showed Mishra being surrounded and heckled by a few AAP MLAs on the floor of the house. The Speaker had to summon marshals to rescue Mishra and take him away.Talking to reporters outside the Assembly, Mishra said he was punched in the chest by AAP MLAs. ""I had written a letter to the Speaker on Kejriwal's corruption and asked to be allowed to speak during the Assembly session. I had also called for a special session at the Ramlila Maidan but I was attacked,"" Mishra said. ""I was thrashed, some of them kicked me on the chest. But I am not afraid of them. Kejriwal and Satyendra Jain are corrupt and have been exposed. My fight against these corrupt leaders will continue,"" Mishra said. Mishra, who served as Water Supply minister, was removed from the post after he claimed that he has evidence to show that Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleague Satyendra Jain were involved in corruption. Mishra had said he saw Kejriwal receiving Rs 2 crore unaccounted money from Jain.Mishra had recently accused the Aam Aadmi Party of under-reporting its donation figures to the Election Commission.He alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party had Rs 45.74 crore in its bank accounts during the financial year 2013-2014.

Hostel in Pakistan prohibits girls from sharing beds,"Every now and then, educational institutions surprise the world with rules that are beyond the realms of logic. From dress codes to hostel timings, these rules become even more creative when women are involved--the latest testament being a circular that is believed to be issued by the International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan.

Parents have no right to dead kid's FB account: German court,"The parents of a dead 15-year-old who appealed to Facebook to allow them access to her account to see if she was being bullied before her death have lost their claim in court.Berlin?s court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the parents of the teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her details or chat history. The ruling goes against the decision made in an initial judgment by the regional court in 2015. It raises fresh questions over digital inheritance and who has the right to manage someone?s online presence and intellectual property when they die.The court said it had made the ruling according to the telecommunications secrecy law which precludes heirs from viewing the communications of a deceased relative with a third party. Before the ruling both Facebook and the parents of the girl, whose identity has not been made public, reserved the right in the event of a defeat to take an appeal to Germany?s federal court of justice in Karlsruhe. The judge said they were free to do so, but the parents have not confirmed that this is what they still intend to do.The family have said they are desperate to find out whether the girl?s death in Berlin was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying. They have said they want Facebook to allow access to chats she might have had online which might provide a clue as to the cause of their daughter?s unexpected death.The girl had reportedly given her mother the login details to her account when she was 14 but the company, having been informed of the girl?s death by one of her Facebook friends, froze or ?memorialised? her account. The move meant that photos and posts the girl had shared remained visible, and friends could pay tribute to her, but it was no longer possible to log in to the account. Facebook has refused to say who applied for the account to be frozen, also citing data protection. The person who lodged the request would have had to provide Facebook with proof that the girl had died. The US social media company has repeatedly rejected the parents? request, arguing that in the event messages from a user are revealed, other users would also be exposed. They argue that the conversations would have taken place on the understanding that their content remained private.In its 2015 ruling, Berlin?s regional court ruled in favour of the mother, arguing that the contents of the daughter?s Facebook account should be owned by her heirs. The judge insisted then that Facebook chats should be regarded no differently to the girl?s letters and diaries which her parents automatically inherited. Facebook appealed against that ruling, which is why the case was heard by the court of appeal. The ruling on Wednesday was based on weighing up inheritance laws drawn up almost 120 years ago and the rights of parents towards minors, with the telecommunications secrecy law introduced to protect the privacy of telephone conversations which was updated by the constitutional court in 2009 to include emails. Björn Retzlaff, the judge who ruled in Berlin, deemed that the same rules applied to internet chats. ?That is at the centre of our decision,? Retzlaff told the court, stressing at the same time that the decision had been a difficult one.In a statement in German to the media Facebook said it welcomed the ruling, adding: ?At the same time we are sympathetic towards the family and respect their wish. We are making every effort to find a solution which helps the family at the same time as protecting the privacy of third parties who are also affected by this.?The case recalls that of an Italian architect who appealed to Apple?s chief executive, Tim Cook, last year to unblock his dead 13-year-old son?s iPhone so he could download the photographs stored on it.",technology,3823,60,70
Govt plans to penalise those found guilty of polluting Ganga,"Ganga New Delhi, Dec 26 (PTI) The Narendra Modi-government is planning to penalise those found guilty of polluting the Ganga river, in a first of its kind bill which aims to ensure cleanliness and uninterrupted flow of the river.

Bank with suspicious deposits worth ?871 crore under probe,"New Delhi, Jan 8 (PTI) The Income Tax department has detected huge alleged discrepancies in the transactions of a Rajkot-based cooperative bank where Rs 871 crore deposits were made, over 4,500 new accounts opened and more than five dozen accounts having same mobile number initiated, making it one of the biggest cases of black fund generation post November 8. The departments Ahmedabad probe wing has now initiated action under tax laws and has sought full details from the bank after it conducted survey operations against it sometime back and found large irregularities. Officials said the departments investigation till now has found that cash deposits of Rs 871 crore, majorly using the old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, was made in this bank between November 9-December 30 last year while Rs 108 crore was withdrawn during the same period in a highly suspicious manner not commensurate with the banks activities during the same period in 2015 or at other times. The sleuths have identified at least 25 high value cash deposits post demonetisation where Rs 30 crore monies have been transacted in an alleged suspicious and unsatisfactory manner and in accounts with purported weak KYC norms in place. An I-T analysis report prepared in this regard states that Rs 10 crore funds were deposited in a number of ""dormant"" accounts post the currency scrap, including in that of a petroleum firm where Rs 2.53 crore was deposited. What has startled the taxman has been the fact that a total of ""4,551 new accounts were opened in the bank post demonetisation as against the average 5,000 of such accounts usually opened in the full year while 62 of these were opened using one mobile number.""",general,1691,58,70
Delhi driver held for masturbating at 33-yr-old German woman,"A 32-year-old driver has been arrested for allegedly masturbating in front of a foreign woman while she was taking her dog out for a walk in the posh Greater Kailash neighbourhood on Thursday afternoon.When the 33-year-old German national confronted the man, he tried to escape in his car. But the woman used her presence of mind to take a photo of the man?s car, an act that led to his arrest on Saturday.The woman hails from Berlin in Germany and is pursuing her PhD from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Having arrived in India last year, she had taken a rented accommodation in Greater Kailash 2.The incident happened around 2.45 pm on Thursday. The woman was walking her dog in the neighbourhood, when she noticed a man staring at her. She paused for a moment, but continued walking her dog again.?Suddenly, the man removed his trousers and began masturbating while staring at the woman, leaving her shocked,? said Romil Baaniya, deputy commissioner of police (south-east).The woman decided to confront the man and began screaming at him, but he chose to run into his Maruti Suzuki Ritz car that was parked nearby.?But the woman decided not to let him get away easily. She immediately brought out her mobile phone and took photos of the car, ensuring the registration number was captured,? said the DCP.Even as the man drove away, the woman dialled the police control room. A police team immediately arrived at the spot. ?The woman provided us the photos she had taken and described the man?s features in detail,? said an investigator.The inputs from the woman proved vital.

Solar power plants to be installed in Dilli Haats,"In a bid to go green, the Delhi government has decided to install solar plants at major art and culture hubs across the national capital. To start with, the Dilli Haats at Pitampura and Janakpuri will adopt green energy. The solar plant coming up at Dilli Haat, Pitampura ? once ready ? is going to be self-sufficient in electricity generation. Slated to be commissioned in March, it is going to cover 98.5% of the power demand of the haat.?Dilli Haat, Pitampura will almost become power sufficient through this solar initiative. Moreover, we are going to save 40% on our electricity bills. At present, we buy power from a discom at Rs 8.7 per unit. Once the solar system is commissioned, we would get power at R 5.10 per unit,? said Rajesh Juneja of Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) who is in-charge of the project. The average power consumption of Dilli Haat Pitampura is about 140 kilowatt (kW) and the roof-top solar plant is going to generate 138 kW.The one at Janakpuri, on the other hand, will be smaller with a capacity of 50 kW. When asked why the famous Dilli Haat at INA wasn?t included in the project, an official from the power department said, ?Dilli Haat INA was the first choice, but almost all of its roof-tops have shadow areas. This is because the area has a lot of eucalyptus trees and to install solar panels, a roof-top has to be clear and must get direct sunlight.?Next, the government plans to install a solar plant at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College and Dwarka Court. It is also setting up another 75 kW plant atop the Old Secretariat building, where the Delhi assembly meets.Delhi has an installed capacity to generate 32 MW of solar power.

MP primary school students forced to study in a toilet,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one tells much more than that.A photograph of a group of primary school students studying in a toilet instead of a classroom in Neemuch district belies the tall claims of the Madhya Pradesh government about its efforts to improve education in the state. The students are being forced to study in a disused toilet because there is no school building. The primary school run by a single teacher is not situated in a remote area but at Mokhampura village which is only 35 km away from the Neemuch district headquarters. Shockingly, the local MLA is not even aware that such a school exists in his constituency, though the officials of the state education department acknowledge the appalling situation. The school was set up in 2012. For a year, the school had functioned out of a rented room. Now, that?s not available.A photograph of the school which has 34 children clearly shows that the room in which they are studying is a toilet that was built by the government. If that?s not bad enough, a few goats are sometimes tied in the toilet ? perhaps to prevent them from getting wet in the rain. School teacher Kailash Chandra says that he has been forced to take classes in the toilet because there is no school building. ?When the weather is fine in summer and winter, the classes are held under a tree, but now the earth is wet so I cannot hold the classes under a tree and am forced to use the toilet,? he told HT.Kailash Chandra said that it is not as if the higher-ups have not been informed. ?I have informed them of the condition a number of times over the years, but no one is paying any attention,? he said.

Smart headlights to help drivers see through rain developed,"Washington, Jul 4 (PTI) Scientists, including one of Indian origin, have developed a smart headlight system for the first time that can help drivers see through heavy rain or snowfall and safely navigate roads during stormy nights. The system invented by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the US improves visibility by constantly redirecting light to shine between particles of precipitation. It prevents the distracting and sometimes dangerous glare that occurs when headlight beams are reflected by precipitation back toward the driver. ""If youre driving in a thunderstorm, the smart headlights will make it seem like its a drizzle,"" said Srinivasa Narasimhan, CMU associate professor of robotics. The system uses a camera to track the motion of raindrops and snowflakes and then applies a computer algorithm to predict where those particles will be just a few milliseconds later. The light projection system then adjusts to deactivate light beams that would otherwise illuminate the particles in their predicted positions. ""A human eye will not be able to see that flicker of the headlights,"" Narasimhan said. ""And because the precipitation particles arent being illuminated, the driver wont see the rain or snow either,"" To people, rain can appear as elongated streaks that seem to fill the air. To high-speed cameras, however, rain consists of sparsely spaced, discrete drops. That leaves plenty of space between the drops where light can be effectively distributed if the system can respond rapidly. Lab tests demonstrated that the smart headlight system could detect raindrops, predict its movement and adjust a light projector accordingly in 13 milliseconds. At low speeds, such a system could eliminate 70 to 80 per cent of visible rain during a heavy storm, while losing only five or six per cent of the light from the headlamp. To operate at highway speeds and to work effectively in snow and hail, the systems response will need to be reduced to just a few milliseconds. Lab tests have demonstrated the feasibility of the system and the researchers are confident that the speed of the system can be boosted. For instance, the test apparatus couples a camera with an off-the-shelf DLP projector. Road-worthy systems likely would be based on arrays of light-emitting diode (LED) light sources in which individual elements could be turned on or off, depending on the location of raindrops.",general,2416,59,70

Four arrested for beating up man in Maha for 'carrying beef',"A 36-year-old Muslim man was hospitalised with serious injuries after he was assaulted in a Maharashtra town on Wednesday evening allegedly by self-styled cow protectors who accused him of carrying beef. The Nagpur police have arrested four men for the assault in Jalalkheda town, the latest in a series of violent incidents involving cow vigilante groups.?We have arrested all the four accused and they would be produced before the court for police custody,? Jalalkheda police station in-charge Vijay Tiwari said on Thursday.The four are the members of Prahar Sanghatana, which describes itself as a social and cultural body. Sanghatana is led by Bacchu Kadu, an independent MLA from Amravati.According to reports, Ismail Shah was pulled off his two-wheeler by four men, who accused him of carrying cow meat. Shah kept telling them it was goat meat and not beef but the men won?t listen to him.Police identified the alleged attackers as Ashwin Uike, Janardan Chowdhury, Rameshwar Tayde and Moreshwar Tandulkar. A Delhi youth was stabbed in a train last month after an argument, as the crowd accused him and his brothers of being ?beef eaters?. The killing sparked nationwide protest, forcing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say ?killing people in the name of protecting cows is not acceptable?. A map of mob violence and lynchings reported since the Dadri incidentThere has been a rise in incidents of mob violence in the name of cow, considered holy by many Hindus.

Ex-Maha CM targets Sena over Mumbai not becoming world-class,"Mumbai, July 28 (PTI) Senior Congress leader Narayan Rane today took a dig at the Shiv Sena and the party controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) over Mumbai lagging behind Singapore and Shanghai, which, he said became the world class cities in the last three decades. Initiating a debate in the Legislative Council on a resolution moved by the Opposition on issues concerning Mumbai, the former chief minister said while Shanghai, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur became the world class cities in the last 25-30 years Mumbai is lagging behind. He said the BMC came into existence in 1856 and since then 152 years have been passed. In a jibe aimed at the Sena which has been ruling the Mumbai civic body for over two decades now, Rane said, ""Cities like Singapore, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur rose to fame as the world class cities only in the last 25 to 30 years. But Mumbai, which came into existence 152 years ago, has not been able to progress into a world class city"". Rane, who had served as a corporator early in his political career, said had the contemporary corporators been learned enough, they would not have allowed the BMC Commissioner to cut the capital expenditure in the annual civic budget. ""The surplus funds lying with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and the Rs 60,000 crore of the BMC that are lying in Fixed Deposits with the banks should be used to make Mumbai a world class city,"" Rane said. In order to develop Mumbai into a truly global city, the government should appoint an agency, give them three months time, he said, adding that World Bank, the Centre and the state governments could create a fund for the development of civic infrastructure. Despite contributing 25 to 30 per cent by way of tax to the Central kitty, Mumbais condition continues to be pathetic, he added. In an apparent reference to Sena president Uddhav Thackerays remarks suggesting that the BMC was helpless when it rains heavily in Mumbai, Rane said even if it rains 400 mm in a day, Central Mumbai gets water logged. ""Some parts of Mumbai are below the sea level. But why no steps have been taken to improve sewerage system and pumping stations?"" he asked. Taking potshots at Sena over its recent stand-off with RJ Malishka Mendonsa who mocked the civic body on various issues through a video, Rane said Mumbai is a 152-year-old city and over the years, new unbelievable technological innovations have been made.",world,2450,60,70

Chinese official demoted for not smoking near Muslim leaders,"leaders From K J M Varma Beijing, Apr 11 (PTI) In an unusual move, China has demoted a ruling Communist party official in the volatile Uygur Muslim majority Xinjiang province for not ""daring"" to smoke in front of local religious leaders, regarding it as a sign of timidity in fighting against extremism. Jelil Matniyaz, the party chief of a village in Hotan, Xinjiang was demoted from ""senior staff member"" to ""staff member"" on March 25 for his ""infirm political stands...and for being afraid to smoke in front of religious figures,"" a notice posted on the Hotan Dailys social media WeChat account said. ""Smoking is a personal choice, and religious and ordinary people should respect each other, but his behaviour of not daring to smoke conforms with extreme religious thought in Xinjiang,"" the Global Times quoted a Hotan official as saying. ""As a party chief, he should lead the fight against extreme religious thought, otherwise, he would fail to confront the threat of extreme regional forces,"" the official said. ""According to local religion customs, smoking is not allowed in front of older or religious people,"" Turgunjun Tursun, a professor with the Zhejiang Normal University, said. However, some religious people force ordinary citizens also to comply with the requirements, a senior official who had been working in Xinjiang for years, told the paper. The officials demotion is an isolated case, Tursun said, adding that the local government should balance de-extremist behaviour and local customs in the crackdown on extremism. The move to demote the official comes as authorities intensified their efforts to curb religious extremism. Early this month, the province where the Chinese security forces are battling recurring attacks by Uygur militants enacted a new law banning a wide range of acts, including wearing veils or growing ""abnormal"" beards. In Xinjiang, the Turkic speaking Uygurs are restive for several years over increasing settlements of Han population from other provinces. China blames separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Al-Qaeda affiliated group for the spate of violent attacks in the province.

Frenchman becomes world's most expensive defender at ?436 cr,"Manchester City have taken their summer spending to more than £200m with the signing of Benjamin Mendy from Monaco and increased their total outlay in the transfer market since Pep Guardiola took charge 13 months ago to £385m.The transfer fee of £52m (?57.5m) for Mendy is a world record for a defender and is Guardiola?s latest signal of intent as he seeks to build a squad capable of winning major silverware in his second season at the Etihad Stadium.City?s spending is closing in on Real Madrid?s record for money outlayed in a single transfer window by one club, set when the Spanish club spent ?257m (£230m) in the summer of 2009 bringing in Xabi Alonso, Karim Benzema, Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo.Mendy, who has signed a five-year contract with City, had been identified as a key target by Guardiola following the departure of the left-back Gaël Clichy at the end of last season and Aleksandar Kolarov, who left for Roma last week after seven years at the club. His signing completes a transformation of City?s defence since Guardiola?s appointment last summer.City confirmed over the weekend the £26.5m switch from Real Madrid of Danilo, who is expected to provide cover for the first-choice full-backs Mendy and the £45m signing from Tottenham Hotspur, Kyle Walker. They will line up alongside other expensive arrivals including the centre-back John Stones, signed last season for £47m, and the £34.9m goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica.The signing of Mendy, in particular, is a statement not only of City?s financial firepower but also of Guardiola?s determination to build the kind of ruthless attacking machine which he developed at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Mendy, 23, came through Le Havre?s youth system before a move to Marseille in 2013. He switched to Monaco last summer for £11m where he established himself as one of the best full-backs in the world with his powerful and direct style of play as the club claimed the French title and reached the Champions League semi-finals.Like Walker, Mendy is at his most effective going forward and City will hope the duo can add a surge of energy in wide areas that was lacking last season; Guardiola received some criticism for switching between four and three at the back and deploying his full-backs in unfamiliar roles tucked into midfield. City?s new recruits indicate a move towards a more typical and consistent four-man defence, although Mendy and Walker are comfortable at wing-back.Mendy will join City?s squad in Los Angeles where Guardiola?s side are preparing to face Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup .?I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester City,? Mendy said. ?They are one of Europe?s leading clubs and in Pep Guardiola they have a manager committed to playing attacking football. I am sure that over the next few years we will be successful.?Txiki Begiristain, City?s director of football, said: ?Benjamin has all the qualities we are looking for in a full-back. For such a young player he has a wealth of top-level experience. He is undoubtedly one of the world?s best full-backs, our No1 target in this position. We are all delighted to have him here at Manchester City.?",sports,3172,60,70

Petition to challenge domicile rules for medical seats in SC,"Medical and dental aspirants in the state are up for another fight for seats in coveted colleges, with a petition planned to challenge the new rules on domicile eligibility. Unhappy with the state?s decision to relax domicile eligibility for medical and dental admissions in state, parents of a group of students are filing a writ petition in the Supreme Court this week. Close to 40 parents had gathered at the Directorate of Medical Education & Research (DMER) on Saturday evening to discuss issues about medical admissions with the officials. ?Based on a recently passed high court order, the DMER has relaxed domicile norms because of which the ranks are very high this year. Students from other states have made it into the state quota merit list while our children are struggling,? said Mahendra Chaudhuri, one of the parents.On July 7, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court relaxed domicile norms for medical and dental aspirants in the state. Originally, those who had cleared Class 10 and 12 from state or had a domicile certificate were eligible for state quota seats. Now, the compulsion on Class 10 from state has been dropped. ?Those who have cleared Class 12 from Maharashtra, even without Class 10 from the state, will be eligible for state quota seats from now,? said Dr Pravin Shingare, director of DMER.Parents said the purpose of state quota seats was being defeated as most students from the state were losing out on seats in state-run and private institutes due to this change in eligibility criteria. ?We have no option but to take our fight to the SC once again this year. Our children deserve seats in state institutes,? said Ranjan Mehta, another parent.Parents were also unhappy with DMER?s decision to not release a revised provisional state merit list, after verification of documents of all aspirants. ?Thousands of students apply for seat in Maharashtra medical and dental institutes and document verification will decide whether all those who have applied are eligible for state quota seats. DMER cannot do away with this procedure,? said Mehta. She added that parents have requested DMER to release a final list before the first seat allotment list is out on July 25.",general,2207,60,70

In 1847 the Chinese Government admitted that this boundary was sufficiently and distinctly fixed. The area now claimed by China has always been depicted as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials and even a Chinese map of shows it as Indian territory.""On the McMahon Line, Nehru wrote: ""The McMahon Line-As you are aware, the so-called McMahon Line runs eastwards from the eastern borders of Bhutan and defines the boundary of China on the one hand and on the India and Burma on the other. Contrary to what has been reported to you, this line was, in fact, drawn at a Tripartite Conference held at Simla in 1913-1914 between the Plenipotentiaries of the Governments of China, Tibet and India. At the time of acceptance of the delineation of this frontier, Lonchen Shatra, the Tibetan Plenipotentiary, in letters exchanged, stated explicitly that he had received orders from Lhasa to agree to the boundary as marked on the map appended to the Convention.""

Even Allah doesn't want impure mosque in Ayodhya: RSS,"Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn't want an 'impure' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, ""Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it's unlikely that it will ever come up.""Questioning the legitimacy of the Babri Masjid, Kumar said that the 15th century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshiped one God.""The land is disputed and it was claimed after destroying a Ram temple that existed there, thus Allah never accepted the structure and even namaz was never conducted at the place. Today, Muslims have realized that it was an illegal structure,"" he explained.Going back in time, the veteran RSS ideologue blamed the dispute on a mistake by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the subcontinent. TRY BABUR IN COURT ""The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was destroyed by Babur 400 years ago. Had he not indulged in that act to build such an impure mosque, there would not have been such a predicament today. I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi,"" he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don't want an 'illegal' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land.""They (Muslims) have realised that Ram and Khuda are all the same, they are one supreme power. The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,"" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.""They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever.

His tour of the subcontinent, which included a maiden Test defeat against Bangladesh, culminated with a 0-4 loss in the five-Test series against India.Joe Root was appointed as his replacement, with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) almost immediately announcing the decision.""I don't know if I'd have taken the captaincy but it would have been nice to have been considered for it,"" ESPNcricinfo quoted Anderson as saying.""From a personal point of view I'd have seriously thought about it, but from the outside looking in I'd have thought: is this actually where the team needs to go - with a 34-year-old as captain?""""I don't know how long I'm going to keep going for and in the grand scheme of things it makes sense for a younger guy to do it,"" he added.Anderson, who is a veteran of 122 Tests and England's all-time leading wicket-taker, pointed out that most of the fast bowling captains he had known have been pretty successful and was thus surprised why more fast bowlers aren't given the opportunity to do it.""I'm all for bowlers being captains,"" he said.Anderson's arguments can be backed up seeing the examples of Shaun Pollock, Courtney Walsh, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis who have successfully led their sides in all the formats of the game.The 34-year-old will play for Lancashire in the County Championship, in a bid to get match fit after sustaining a shoulder injury during England's tour of India last year.",general,1781,60,70

Although Chief Justice Chellur did not believe this situation was due to the strike but the government pleader, appearing for the state government, told the court that the health care in civic and state-run hospitals was paralysed due to 60 per cent of its workforce not reporting to work.Advocate Prashant Pophale appearing for the Maharashtra Association for Resident Doctors (MARD) pointed out that there have been three incidents wherein patients' relatives have beaten up doctors in Dhule, Mumbai (Sion Hospital) and Nashik in the last few days.WHY THE PUBLIC ANARCHY, ASKS CHIEF JUSTICE CHELLUR Chief Justice Chellur asked, ""Why the public anarchy? It's madness,"" before asking the state pleader to explain the reason for the such action taken by the patients' relatives. She added, ""I don't say doctors don't commit mistakes but, there are complications due to which patients lose their life. Every case cannot be due to negligence. And even if there is negligence there are redressal forums for it.""Pophale pointed out to the court that the doctors are not on strike but only on mass leave and as an association, they have been telling the doctors not to do so. He, however, added that the state has done little to protect the doctors. But Chief Justice Chellur was of the opinion that the resident doctors cannot put the public at large in trouble. ""If you (resident doctors) think being a doctor you can behave like a factory worker, then you are unfit to serve as a doctor. It's a shame. How can you (resident doctors) say first provide security only then we will work?"" asked Chief Justice Chellur.NEXT HEARING TOMORROWWith this, the Bombay High Court ordered the striking resident doctors to join work or face action by the management. It said that the management is free to initiate action and contempt proceedings against the striking doctors. The next hearing of the case is on March 22.After the Bombay High Court issued the order, Naresh Kabra, a resident doctor at Sion Hospital present at the hearing, said, ""We are not super humans either. Patients verbally abuse us almost every day but we don't say anything. It's only when we are physically beaten up that we have protested. Why cannot the state protect us?"" Kabra pointed out that after subsequent court orders, 58 CCTV cameras were installed at Sion Hospital but the audit report shows that only eight are functional.",health,2794,57,70

You cannot copyright a character: 'Rangoon' makers,"Justice KR Shriram will be convening his court at 10 am on Thursday so that he can finish hearing the arguments with regards to the release of film Rangoon, and probably pass an order. The court is hearing a petition filed by Wadia Movietone Pvt Ltd which has dragged Rangoon makers to court over an uncanny resemblance between Kangana Ranaut's character, Julia, and Fearless Nadia, the pre-independence era Australian actress Mary Evans. Evans had taken up the screen name of Nadia, and had acted in many films like Hunterwali. Wadia lawyers Navroz Seervai and Priyanka Khimani had told the court that there were 19 similarities between their 1935 movie, Hunterwali, featuring Fearless Nadia, and Rangoon's trailer.On Monday, the court had asked both the parties to consider settling the issue, but none was ready to bow down. Senior advocate Virendra Tuljapurkar cited various judgements of Indian courts to show that copyright law does not cover a character. ""You cannot copyright a character. Under American laws it can be, but they are redundant in India as a copyright over a character does not exist.""Tuljapurkar also said that the character of Fearless Nadia was developed by Homi Wadia and his brother who wrote, directed and produced the films. ""It was later that a company was formed which took over the films. But in their own petition they say that they are still in the process of looking for the scripts and screenplays. So they themselves do not have the copyright. Do they have documents showing title, assignment that the author has given it to them?""Senior advocate Ravi Kadam, on behalf of Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, told the court that no film had the character of Fearless Nadia. The actress used to be called fearless as she used to do daring stunts herself. Moreover, Evans was one of the few actresses who started working in films when not many women dared to do so and that's why she was nicknamed Fearless Nadia. ""It's like calling Hema Malini, the dream girl. The actor has played many characters but she is known as dream girl. Now one cannot have a copyright over dream girl,"" said Kadam. He added that the film is set at the time of pre-independence era. ""No claim can be made around historical facts. Fearless Nadia is a historic figure,"" argued Kadam. He said the film is about a dancer Julia who is in love with the director played by Saif Ali Khan. She later goes to Burma where she meets a soldier played by Shahid Kapoor, who is working for the Indian National Army and is on a secret mission.Kadam accepted that the Rangoon makers were in talks with the Wadias for copyright on Fearless Nadia between 2006 and 2015. Emails showing the conversations between the two parties were perused by the petitioners. ""However when they said that the copyright is already been given to someone else it was not pursued any further,"" said Kadam.",general,2870,51,70

Fake ?100 notes seized from two persons with ISI links,"Delhi Police special cell on Friday arrested two persons, reportedly associated with the ISI and seized Rs 6 lakh in fake Rs 100 notes that they were allegedly trying to funnel into India from Nepal.According to sources the consignment worth Rs 6 lakh of FICN (fake Indian currency notes) was smuggled from Nepal to India. Sources said that earlier Malda route was used to pump in FICN of Rs 2,000 denomination.Police said that the Border Security Force and National Investigating Agency busted that module while the special cell of Delhi police made the seizure in the capital?s Sonia Vihar area. This is the first seizure of 100 rupee notes post demonetisation. One of the main aims of demonetising high value bank notes was to stop fake currency being pumped into the economy. But a spate of seizures recently, including some of high denominations, indicate that counterfeiters do not seem to have been hit hard.Last month, the Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested three men and claimed to have busted a fake currency printing racket. Counterfeit notes in the denomination of Rs 2,000 ?with a total face value of Rs 18 lakh ?were seized from them.Also read |?Demonetisation affects Nepal, black marketing of currency rampant at border",general,1241,54,70
World's cheapest phone Freedom 251 maker's MD quits,"Noida-based startup Ringing Bells, infamous for selling the 'cheapest smartphone in the world' aka Freedom 251 is in news again. Co-founder and MD Mohit Goel, who is said to be the brains behind the Rs 251 smartphone, has quit. His wife, Dharna Goel, who is CEO of Ringing Bells, has also resigned. But Ringing Bells isn't (apparently) shutting shop.""At Ringing Bells we have our clear business objectives which we have shared earlier with everyone and we are sticking to it. Now Anmol Goel, who is also one of the founder directors, is looking after the affairs of the company and will take forward the company to make it achieve the goals that it has set for itself,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Also Read: Ringing Bells wants to promote Digital India, but doesn't quite believe in Startup IndiaAnmol Goel, as clear from the statement, is also one of the founder directors of Ringing Bells. Anmol and Mohit are brothers. The company president (consulting) Ashok Chadha, meanwhile, will continue as one, sources have confirmed to India Today Tech.That however does not explain why the company's sector 62 office in Noida has been shut for over two weeks now. India Today Tech has reached out to the company seeking more clarity on the issue and will update the piece once we have more information.As of the Freedom 251 itself, the company claims that it has so far delivered around 70,000 units of the Rs 251 smartphone, and will continue to do so, albeit a little differently. ""Delivery of Freedom 251 will be made by retailers who will get the products in turn from the distributors and they in turn from the company as is the standard practice in trade. In addition, as has been underpinned and re-clarified on several occasions, the sales are only on cash on delivery basis. The company is making efforts to deliver more Freedom 251 in recent months,"" it said. That should explain why ringingbells.co.in wouldn't open anymore, however, not entirely. This is because the only way to order (and luckily receive) a Freedom 251 was via the official website. Now that the website is down, there is no way for those who registered (for the device) to know their impending status. The company has launched a slew of other devices (feature phones, smartphones, TVs and power banks) in the meanwhile, and at least some of them are available from Amazon India. The future of the Freedom 251, however, remains as bleak as ever. Again, we've reached out to the company for a little more clarity and will update the piece as and when we get a response. Ringing Bells claims that it has so far delivered around 70,000 units of the Freedom 251 in states such as West Bengal, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, New Delhi, Punjab, J&K, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Apparently, it is ""still getting lot of interest in its product,"" that many have called a Ponzi scheme. ""We have proved that it is possible to arm each and everyone with the reality of digital world. Our target is the low income people who fancy the chances to own a smart phone. We wish to fulfill their dreams soon,"" the company added.",business,3159,51,70
"Mera Naam Joker, Sangam last films to be screened at Regal","Raj Kapoor?s Mera Naam Joker and Sangam will be the last two movies to be shown at Delhi?s 85-year-old Regal cinema hall that is closing down on March 30.One of the owners of the hall, Vishal Choudhary, said that he received many requests and fan mails requesting them to screen Raj Kapoor?s movies as the hall was his favourite. He is said to have visited the theatre regularly and hosted premieres of several films released under the banner of RK films, including Sangam that released in 1964 and Mera Naam Joker, first screened in 1970.The hall that is currently playing Anushka Sharma-starrer Phillauri will show Mera Naam Joker in the evening at six and Sangam at 9pm on Thursday.Regal Cinema in Connaught Place was the first theatre in the area opened in 1932 by Sir Sobha Singh.Called the New Delhi Premier Theatre in its early days, Regal may return as a multiplex with four auditoria. According to the owners, they are trying to get permission from agencies concerned to build a multiplex at the same spot.?The facade will not be changed as the building is a heritage structure but inside there will be major changes including a new design of the hall, better seats, new toilets and canteen,? said Choudhary.The corridors and the staircase of the hall is lined with black and white photographs of actors Dev Anand, Meena Kumari, Nargis, and Raj Kapoor.?Raj Kapoor and Nargis would spend time a lot of time here. Kapoor often sat through the premieres of his films. The theatre was decorated and rituals were performed before the start of every film. Every show then was house full in advance for at least a week,? said Roop Ghai, manager.Choudhary said he has got 60% of the proposal to build a multiplex cleared. ?We have got the no-objection certificate from fire department and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as it is a heritage site. Our designs have been approved by Delhi Urban Arts Commission,? he told Hindustan Times.?It will, however, take at least a year before the work begins as we have to take permission from several other departments and it takes a long time to complete these things,? he said. Hindustan Times had reported on December 22 that the cinema was on the verge of closing due to severe cash crunch aggravated by demonetisation.Choudhary said it was time to fold up Regal as they had not been making money for many years now. ?Business has been down for a decade and last month?s collection of Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya film was also not very good.? He said the cinema hall has been unable to recover operating costs over the past two years. ?Half the money we get from tickets goes to the distributor. It costs us over Rs 2 lakh a week to run a show.?Choudhary also said that they didn?t want to take any chances after the collapse of some buildings in Connaught Place recently. The New Delhi Municipal Council has asked the owners of buildings in the area to prove structural capability. This is another reason why he decided to close the theatre and rebuild it.The first and second floors of the Regal Building were sold to Madame Tussauds in 1996, so the famed wax museum could open its 22nd branch in Delhi. The ground floor remains with the owner.",general,3192,59,70

Ghajini director slams National Awards jury for being biased,"This year, award shows have come under the scanner. After the Filmfare Awards got flak for not nominating Akshay Kumar (Airlift) or Manoj Bajpayee (Aligarh) in the Best Actor category, the National Awards are being slammed for their decisions. Filmmaker AR Murugadoss also alleged on Twitter that the National Awards were biased this time. ""Can clearly witness the influence & partiality of people in jury, it's biased,"" he wrote.#NationalAwardsCan clearly witness the influence & partiality of people in jury, it's biased.The decision to give Akshay Kumar the Best Actor for Rustom over other contenders like Aamir Khan (Dangal) and Manoj Bajpayee (Aligarh) has been questioned, with many alleging that the jury headed by Priyadarshan was biased. That the filmmaker is close to Akshay is common knowledge, and many claim that he abused his position as the head of the jury to favour the actor, who he directed in several films like Hera Pheri and Bhool Bhulaiyya.However, Priyadarshan defended the decision and told Indian Express, ""Why are we insulting an actor? If he was a bad actor, how is he one of the top stars of the film industry for so many years? 38 people decided to award him and these people are sensible. Does that mean they are fools? Also, last year Mr Amitabh Bachchan got the best actor trophy (for Piku) and Ramesh Sippy was on the jury, no one questioned that. When Ajay Devgn won for Gangaajal, Prakash Jha was on the jury. That time also no one said anything.""Other than Murugadoss, Aligarh director Hansal Mehta too expressed his disappointment over the list of winners. However, he clarified that the disappointment wasn't directed at anyone. He wrote on Twitter, ""When I expressed my disappointment about the National Awards it was personal and not directed at anybody. I would like to believe that the jury has done its best within their understanding and framework. Aligarh was not considered worthy in that framework by the appointed juries just like Lunchbox was ignored in the year that Shahid won two national awards. I did not complain then and I am not complaining now either. I've got to respect the decision and move on.""He added, ""What hurts is that in some statement the chairperson who I respect and whose films I've often enjoyed says that 'While watching films we realised that a lot of Bollywood movies were themed around homosexuality. The mnovies are not really highlighting social problems. Whereas regional cinema are themed around fantastic social issues.' This statement is disturbing and sensitive. Priyadarshan sir, Aligarh did not meet the standards set by you and your jury - I accept that.

"Rajasthan govt Sanskrit school has 4 teachers, no students","From a distance, this government-run Sanskrit school in Sikar district of Rajasthan appears like any other run-down school with the building in need of paint. But once you enter the premises, it becomes clear that something else is amiss. The school is erringly quiet ? there are no children on the small playground or, for that matter, in the classrooms.The Government Upper Primary Sanskrit School in Pratappura village has six classrooms, four teachers ? but not a single student. The teachers report for work at about 8am, water the plants, read newspaper, chat among themselves and leave after 2pm. They get their salary on time, but are not happy about the state of affairs.?We feel ashamed to be sitting idle the whole day. It was once a thriving school with more than 50 students, but things changed a few years ago,? Sanwarmal, the school?s head teacher, told HT.The school, which was established in 1998 attracted children from the neighbouring villages. In 2005, the student strength peaked to 55 and then gradually began to decline. In 2015-16 academic session, only four students were left and their parents also withdrew them last year. ?A few years ago, the neighbouring villages did not have schools so the children used to come to Pratappura. Now, there are three middle schools within 1-2 km range, and so this school has been deserted,? village sarpanch, Balram Verma, said.Pratappura has a population of about 300, and in most households the head of the family are employed in other towns and only the elders have stayed back to look after the ancestral home. ?The village has only six to seven students from class 1-8 who now study in other schools in the neighbouring villages,? Sanwarmal said.All the teachers are now sick with boredom. ?There is nothing to do here. We even encourage the village elders to come and chat with us so that we are able to pass the time,? Krishna Verma, who is the sole female teacher, said.A retired army man, Kashiram and a farmer, Ghanshyam Singh, are regular visitors.The teachers have approached the education department in Jaipur to shift them on deputation to other nearby schools where there is vacancy for Sanskrit teachers. ?We gave a written request many months ago, but no action has been taken in this regard. We were told that deputations have been stopped for now,? Sanwarmal said. The school has a glorious past, said Prabhudayal Sharma, who joined as a teacher in 2003. ?Some of the students have become doctors and engineers and one of them is a senior police official. But now there is little hope. The chances of the school?s revival are very slim,? he said.As if to emphasise his point, a stray dog wanders inside the premises to be quickly shooed away by one of the teachers.",general,2749,58,70
AIADMK's TTV Dinakaran arrested over charges of bribing EC,"AIADMK Amma leader TTV Dinakaran, who is accused of bribing an Election Commission official to get the AIADMK's frozen ' two leaves' symbol for his faction of the party, has been arrested by Delhi Police's Crime Branch. His longtime friend Mallikarjuna has also been taken into custody.On Tuesday, Dinakaran was questioned for a fourth consecutive day by Delhi Police. He reached the Crime Branch Inter State Cell office in Chanakyapuri at 5 PM. He was arrested after being questioned for close to six hours, Praveer Ranjan, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), said. Dinakaran has been interrogated for a total of 37 hours, and will be produced at Tiz Hazari Court this afternoon after a medical test at Safdarjung Hospital. DINAKARAN ADMITS HE MET SUKESH Dinakaran has admitted to meeting Sukesh Chandrasekhar, under the impression that he was a high court judge, police said on Monday. At the same time, he denied having paid any money to Sukesh in an attempt to obtain the AIADMK's symbol for his camp, police said. Until Monday, Dinakaran had maintained that he didn't know Sukesh, and that he hadn't met him. Police have also questioned Dinakaran's personal assistant Janardhana in connection with the case. Sources said he has agreed to be a witness. WHY WAS MALLIKARJUNA ARRESTED? Mallikarjuna was arrested for allegedly facilitating the deal between Dinakaran and Sukesh Chandrasekar, Praveer Ranjan said.Mallikarjuna had been accompanying Dinakaran everywhere ever since Sukesh was arrested on April 16 for allegedly striking a deal of Rs 50 crore to help the AIADMK (Amma) faction keep the poll symbol.Dinakaran, Mallikarjuna and Chandrasekar will be questioned together to establish the money trail, details of the deal and whether more people were involved in it. CHANDRASEKAR'S CUSTODY EXTENDED On Tuesday, the police produced Chandrasekar before a special court, which extended his custody till April 28. The court was told that Chandrasekar had been paid through hawala channels. ""A person named Shah Faisal told that he had collected a parcel from Chennai and gave it to Chandrasekar, who had posed as a member of Parliament,"" the police said. It is suspected that the parcel contained Rs 10 crore. The police said three Chandni Chowk-based hawala operators will also be questioned in connection with the case. AIADMK REVOLT Dinakaran's arrest comes at a time when there are moves to merge the two factions of the AIADMK - the AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma led by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, and the AIADMK Amma, led by incumbent CM Edappadi Palaniswami (and to which Dinakaran, too, belongs).Dinakaran was in February appointed the AIADMK's deputy general secretary by jailed party chief V S Sasikala - who happens to be his aunt. However, a powerful section of the AIADMK Amma recently revolted against the Sasikala-Dinakaran leadership.That happened after Panneerselvam demanded the ouster of Sasikala and Dinakaran as a condition for the merger.Dinakaran later announced he would stay away from party affairs, and that he could be removed only by Sasikala.Sasikala is currently serving a four-year jail term in Bengaluru in a disproportionate assets case.(Inputs from PTI) ALSO READ | TTV Dinakaran confesses to meeting middleman in EC bribery case, assumed he was high court judge",general,3319,58,70
UK unveils new banknote featuring novelist Jane Austen,"The new £10 note featuring Jane Austen has been unveiled on the 200th anniversary of the author?s death, complete with a quote about reading ? said by one of her characters who has no interest in books. Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote.The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen?s resting place, Winchester Cathedral, includes an image of the writer and one of her most beloved characters, Elizabeth Bennet. There are also illustrations of her writing table and her brother Edward Austen Knight?s home, Godmersham Park in Kent, thought to be a source of inspiration. But it is the quote that will raise eyebrows among Austen enthusiasts. At first glance the line from Pride and Prejudice ? ?I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!? ? seems a good choice. However, the words were spoken by one of Austen?s most deceitful characters, Caroline Bingley, who has no interest in books. She is sidling up to Mr Darcy, whom she would like as a husband. He is reading a book, so she sits next to him and pretends to read alongside him. Speaking at Winchester Cathedral, the Bank of England?s governor, Mark Carney, explained why Austen was chosen ? and the technical aspects of the notes. He said: ?Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country?s collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom?s glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. ?Austen?s novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published.? Turning to practical matters, he said: ?The new £10 will be printed on polymer, making it safer, stronger and cleaner. The note will also include a new tactile feature on the £10 to help the visually impaired, ensuring the nation?s money is as inclusive as possible.? It joins the Churchill £5 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a £20 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. The £10 note has security features that the Bank says make it very difficult to counterfeit. It is expected to last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper £10 notes ? about five years in total. The new tactile feature is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner, developed in conjunction with the RNIB, the charity that supports people with sight loss. This is in addition to the elements already incorporated in UK banknotes for visually impaired people: the tiered sizing, bold numerals, raised print and differing colour palettes.Austen fans will have to wait until later this year before they can begin to use the notes. They will be issued on 14 September and the public will begin to see them in the following days and weeks. The Bank hopes featuring Austen will help it counter accusations of sexism for not featuring more women on notes. The author follows Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry in featuring on notes.Tuesday?s banknote launch is one of a series of events taking place to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen?s death, including the unveiling of a statue in Basingstoke, near her birthplace. Austen, who wrote keenly about money, might have been interested in research from Aviva claiming that the £10 pound note has a relative purchasing power of only 13p compared with what it could buy in 1817.",business,3363,54,70
"Don?t waste time, no vacancy for PM post till 2024: Paswan","oppn (With additional inputs) New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Union Minister and LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan today took a dig at the opposition parties over their attempts at unity, saying they should not waste their time as there is no vacancy for the prime ministers post till 2024. Briefing reporters following his partys national executive meeting on April 29 and 30 in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, he heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""pro-Dalit"" measures. Paswan also expressed confidence that Modi would remain in charge till 2024. The National Executive of LJP also demanded an amendment to be made in the Constitution to implement immediate reservation in promotion. Keeping in view, the continued lack of government jobs, the party also demanded the early implementation of reservation in the private sector, Paswan said. The party also adopted a resolution to make one crore new members throughout the country during a membership drive from August 15 to January 26. He compared his former colleagues-turned-rivals, who are now in different parties, to an orange fruit which looks whole from the outside but is divided inside. ""People like Nitish Kumar (JD-U), Mulayam Singh Yadav (Samajwadi Party), Lalu Prasad (RJD) can never be one. They should stop wasting their time in looking for a prime ministerial candidate. There is no vacancy,"" he said. The next Lok Sabha elections are due in 2019 and the BJP- led NDA is in a buoyant mood following its massive win in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. Paswan raked up corruption allegations against Prasad and his two sons, both ministers in the Nitish Kumar government, and said the JD(U) chief is troubled over this. His party, he said, is also keen on the passage of the Womens Reservation Bill, which mandates 33 per cent quota for women in Parliament, with separate reservation of SCs, STs and OBCs within it. ""All parties are ready for this,"" he said. The LJP also favours simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls and they should be funded by states, he added. Paswan repeated his partys demands, including quota in private jobs and reservation for Dalits, minorities, backward and tribal students in private schools. He also pithed for starting Indian Judicial Service on the lines of IAS to recruit judges with quota provisions. Lauding Modi for promoting places associated with Dalit icon B R Ambedkar, he said his last speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly be included in school syllabi. Ambedkar should also be given a Nobel award, he said. The honour is generally not bestowed posthumously. His party has sought free land for landless people for residential purpose and clean water for every citizen, he said. The LJP resolution demanded that all villages with 20 per cent and more population of Dalits be brought under the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gramin Yojna for their fast development.",general,2869,58,70
Govt rejects claims that India lacks ammunition to fight war,"The Indian armed forces are fully equipped to face any contingency, defence minister Arun Jaitley told the Lok Sabha on Friday amid the ongoing border standoff with China.Asserting that any shortage in terms of arms and ammunition would be expeditiously made up, the minister said the observations by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) about ammunition supplies was for a particular period.Last week, the CAG had slammed the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for critical deficiency in availability of ammunition to the Army.?The armed forces are fully equipped to face any contingency? and any shortage of ammunition would be expeditiously made up, Jaitley said during Question Hour.The remarks come at a time when India and China have been locked in a standoff over the Doklam issue while there have also been rising terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir.In a report, the apex auditor had also criticised the OFB for inadequate quality of ammunition supplied to the Army since March 2013.According to the report, despite serious concerns highlighted in a high-level report on ?Ammunition management in Army? in 2015, no significant improvement took place in the critical deficiency in availability of ammunition and quality of ammunition supplied by the OFB. Regarding CAG reports, Jaitley said that as per procedure, after tabling in Parliament, they go to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and if the latter makes some recommendations, then action would be taken.?If any action is to be taken, it will be taken,? Jaitley said in response to queries on whether any action would be taken against officials following observations in the CAG report.When a member wanted to know about the amount of ammunition required and other details, Jaitley said it is better in public interest not to make any such disclosure.Responding to queries, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre assured the House that no ordnance factory would be closed down and no one would be rendered unemployed.On strategic partnerships in the defence sector, Jaitley said it is intended to institutionalise a transparent, objective and functional mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector in the manufacture of defence platforms and equipment.Besides, the government has approved a proposal for manufacturing of ammunition for the Indian Army by the Indian industry, he said.In this regard, Jaitley said Request for Proposal (RFP) under open tender enquiry was issued in March.?Since the proposal is presently at RFP stage, grant of permission to any private company for manufacturing ammunition in parternship with foreign vendors/companies which have been blacklisted/banned for wrong doings/corrupt practices, does not arise,? the minister said.Further, Jaitley said the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)/Defence Procurement Manual (DPM) contain provisions in standard clauses of contract for use of undue influence, including engagement of agents unauthorisedly by the seller. ?DPP/DPM also provides for execution of a pre-contract integrity pact with the objective of ensuring that the procurement process is free from any wrongful business practice,? he added. The minister also said violation of the pact can result in calling off the negotiations, cancellation of contracts, encashment of bank guarantees and debarment from future procurement.

Putin wanted Hillary Clinton to win presidency: Trump,"President Donald Trump, battling allegations that Russia helped him win the White House, claimed on Wednesday that Vladimir Putin would have preferred a Hillary Clinton victory ? despite US intelligence saying the Russian leader directed a covert effort to help defeat her.?We are the most powerful country in the world and we are getting more and more powerful because I?m a big military person. As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated,? Trump said.?That?s why I say, why would he want me? Because from day one I wanted a strong military, he doesn?t want to see that.?In an interview with Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said ?There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he (Putin) would want.? Trump said he got along ?very, very well? with the longtime Russian leader, whom he met in Hamburg last week. ?So what I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think ?probably not,? because when I want a strong military? he said.?When I want tremendous energy ? we?re opening up coal, we?re opening up natural gas, we?re opening up fracking, all the things that he would hate ? but nobody ever mentions that,? he said.On Saturday, Putin told reporters he had hopes for the bilateral relationship after meeting Trump. ?The Trump that you see on TV is very different than the real Trump,? Putin told reporters at the G20 in Germany. ?He perfectly understands whom he is talking to and answers questions quickly. I think personal relations were established.?Decrying what he called a political ?witch hunt?, Trump has also come to the defense of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, after the release of emails showing his embrace of a Russian offer to provide derogatory information about Clinton during the campaign.The email exchange has been described in some quarters as a possible ?smoking gun? in the ongoing investigation by an independent prosecutor into whether Trump?s campaign colluded with Moscow to get him elected.In a separate interview with Reuters, Trump said he did not fault his son for meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign and that he was unaware of the meeting until a few days ago.Asked if he knew that his son was meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year, the president told Reuters in a White House interview: ?No, that I didn?t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this.?Trump Jr eagerly agreed to meet the woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow?s official support for his father?s campaign, according to emails the son released on Tuesday.Seated at his Oval Office desk, Trump said he did not fault his son for holding the meeting, writing it off as a decision made in the heat of an upstart, non-traditional campaign. ?I think many people would have held that meeting,? he said. ?It was a 20-minute meeting, I guess, from what I?m hearing,? Trump said. ?Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that.?The emails were the most concrete evidence that Trump campaign officials might have been willing to accept Russian help to win the 8 November election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump?s presidency and prompted investigations by the US justice department and Congress.Donald Trump Jr, in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, said: ?In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.?In the White House interview, the president said he directly asked Russian President Vladimir Putin if he was involved in what US intelligence says was Russian meddling in the presidential campaign and that Putin had insisted he was not.Trump said he spent the first 20 or 25 minutes of his more than two-hour meeting with Putin last Friday in Germany on the election meddling subject.?I said, ?Did you do it?? And he said, ?No, I did not. Absolutely not.? I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely not,? Trump said.Asked if he believed Putin?s denial, Trump paused.*Look. Something happened and we have to find out what it is, because we can?t allow a thing like that to happen to our election process. So something happened and we have to find out what it is,? he said.About Putin, he added: ?Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn?t have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.?",world,4466,53,70

Hired killer stole anaesthetic from AIIMS for murder: Cops,"A physiotherapist arrested for the murder of a 28-year-old bank manager in north Delhi stole an anaesthetic from AIIMS to make the lethal cocktail he injected his victim with, Delhi Police sources said on Tuesday. Ravi Kumar, who worked with Kotak Mahindra died on Monday, two days after Prem Singh jabbed him in Sadar Bazaar, where the bank branch was. Prem was paid Rs 1.5 lakh for the hit by a friend, Anish Yadav, who claimed to be in love with Kumar?s wife, police said.?We haven?t received any theft report but if the police are investigating, we will fully cooperate with them,? Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS, said.Singh was with his cousin, who was to undergo a surgery at AIIMS, when he heard two doctors discuss the side effects of the anaesthesia. It gave him the idea that an injection could be used to murder Kumar and make a quick buck, a source said. When the cousin was called for a pre-surgery check-up on December 27, Singh stole a bottle of Midazolam, an anaesthetic, from the hospital, police sources said.Singh told police he had planned to use only Midazolam, thinking Kumar would die of a drug overdose. But, he wanted a foolproof plan. He searched on the Net for drugs which in combination with Midazolam could be fatal. He zeroed on Fortwin, an opioid used to treat pain, and Phenergan, which is used to treat allergy symptoms. He and Yadav bought the drugs and two masks from a chemist.

India's biggest prison does not have a hangman: Reports,"February 9, 2013, 8 am. Convict Afzal Guru hanged inside Tihar jail. The identity of the executioner: Classified. Was a hangman brought from another state? Or was it a jail staff who tied the noose? It remains a secret because there is not a single hangman in India?s largest prison . According to available records, there was never one. The prison in west Delhi has 19 prisoners on death row -- the highest to date. The 19 include the four convicts in the 2012 December gang rape case whose conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court in May. Prison officials said though there is a post of an executioner in the prison manual ever since its construction in the mid 1950s, jail records do not show any name who has worked as one. Over the past years, the jail has received letters from the public offering to be executioners. After the December 16 verdict by the lower court, they had received calls from the public. ?We received 2-3 letters from citizens offering their services to kill convicts on the death row. They were residents of a Meerut village, the same place where a hangman employed at a UP jail lives. They were aware that Tihar does not have a hangman and were willing to do the job,? said an official.According to jail rules, any person who is mentally sound is eligible to be an executor. ?Any jail officer can be the executor. In 1989, we had used the services of a hangman from Meerut jail. It was the execution of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, killers of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. He was officially paid Rs 200,? said a jail officer. According to rules, the allowance for one hanging is two hundred rupees. Sunil Gupta, who served as the law officer in Tihar for three decades, told HT that an executioner?s role is not a positive one. ?A prison is a place for reform. Having an executioner kind of kills the purpose. At Tihar, we believe that prisoners spend time so that they can be reformed.? Gupta said another reason why the jail did not have a hangman was because the man would have no job. From 1989 till 2013, there was no execution. ?If there were a salaried man, he would be getting paid for no work.?",general,2144,55,70

However, Kumar got more votes than expected in many states such as Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Nagaland. The important aspect is that the opposition parties stood united and will remain so in future as well,? Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.Rajasthan brought some cheer for the Congress as Kumar secured half-a-dozen more votes than expected. While the Congress has 24 MLAs and got the support of two BSP legislators and two independents, Kumar secured 34 votes.It was, however, not clear whether any of the surplus votes came from the BJP, which has 161 MLAs. Kovind got the support of 166 and it?s likely that the additional votes for Kumar might have come from smaller parties.In Uttar Pradesh, Kumar was expected to get the vote of 74 legislators from the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. However, she got 65, indicating cracks in the opposition camp, especially the SP.About a dozen legislators from the opposition camp in Maharashtra voted for Kovind. The BJP, the Shiv Sena and some smaller parties that assured their support to the NDA candidate constituted 195 MLAs, but Kovind ended up with 208 votes.The opposition camp comprising 42 MLAs of the Congress and 41 of the Nationalist Congress Party had the support of nine MLAs from the AIMIM, SP and other parties. But Kumar got only 77 votes.The BJP that has made strong forays in West Bengal secured the support of at least five MLAs from the opposition camp. The BJP and its ally, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, have three MLAs each. Kovind secured 11 votes.In Tamil Nadu, both factions of the AIADMK voted for the NDA?s presidential candidate. It was one of the few states such as Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttarakhand that didn?t witness any cross-voting.In Madhya Pradesh, Kumar got the support of 57 MLAs. The Congress has 56 MLAs in the state and Kumar had the assured support of four BSP MLAs and three Independents.Of the 776 members in Parliament, eight did not vote. The votes of 21 were declared invalid.",politics,4006,59,70
Akshay attends rumoured ex-girlfriend Pooja's film screening,"Akshay Kumar is one actor who has buried the hatchet with most of his exes. If he has become business partner with ex-flame Shilpa Shetty, he has no qualms in sharing screen space with Priyanka Chopra.

"Directors should decide if they want cuts, not a board: Azmi","Amid all the controversy over how much say the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), informally called Censor Board, should have in the final version of a film, veteran actor Shabana Azmi says that the whole system needs a revamp. She believes that filmmakers, not the CBFC, should decide whether any scenes get the chop or not.Talking to Hindustan Times during the Delhi premiere of her latest film, The Black Prince, Shabana was all for overhauling the current system, in which the CBFC has the power to demand cuts in a film before certifying it. ?It?s so wrong to call the CBFC the Censor Board in the first place. It is here to certify films; censoring any scene is not its prerogative,? says the actor. Her reply comes in the context of being asked if she would ever take charge of the Censor Board, as her industry colleagues Asha Parekh, Sharmila Tagore and Anupam Kher have done. The 66-year-old Shabana, who has always been vocal on the issue of censorship, asserts, ?The fact is that the Cinematograph Act of 1952 needs serious revision, and we have to leave it to the filmmakers to decide whether they are open to any cuts in the film or not.??There was the Justice Mukul Mudgal panel, in which Javed [Akhtar] saab was also a member, and they also suggested many changes. So, we are only waiting for those changes to be implemented.?Referring to the Shyam Benegal Committee, which, in its 2016 report, recommended fairly drastic changes in how the CBFC works, Shabana adds, ?[The committee] has been saying exactly the same thing: that censorship or [the] certifying system needs to change. Even before this committee, there was the Justice Mukul Mudgal panel, in which Javed [Akhtar] saab was also a member, and they also suggested many changes. So, we are only waiting for those changes to be implemented.?Drawing comparisons with the West, Shabana says that the CBFC needs to adopt the American system for film certification and move away from the current British ideology that is being followed.?However much you say that the CBFC?is an autonomous body, the fact is that those people are taken on the board [who] have some kind of affinity with the ruling party.??The system that we follow here for film certification is a British system, wherein you take about 30-odd people from within society and you literally make them sit on judgment to change the morality of the country every five years, according to the political dispensation of that time. Because, however much you say that it?s an autonomous body, the fact is that those people are taken on the board [who] have some kind of affinity with the ruling party, whether it?s the Congress or the BJP. Now, this is not good for any country?s art,? she says.Shedding light on how the Motion Picture Association of America works, Shabana explains, ?I?ve been saying for a long time now that we should follow the American system, where you have a board of people from within the film industry and they decide... the filmmaker decides that ?I don?t want a single cut in my film, but I recognise that it?s not suitable for children, or not suitable for people of [a] certain age, so I am willing to take an XXX certificate.? Or if a filmmaker says that ?No, I want my film for universal release, so I am open to the suggested cuts.? So [filmmakers] need to have the power to decide, and not any board.?Follow @htshowbiz for more",entertainment,3401,60,70
Faced casting couch only in Malayalam industry: Parvathy,"If you say you aren't smitten by Parvathy, you're probably lying. We love the actor for several reasons, be it her infectious smile or the characters she choose to play in films. However, the actor recently opened up on casting couch saying that it's not a myth, at least in Malayalam industry.Parvathy was quoted by The News Minute as saying, ""Of course there is casting couch in the Malayalam film industry. You know it, I know it, I'm sure a lot of people know it. I don't understand why it's a surprise at all. It's a reality, why are we even shocked about it? I haven't faced it at all in any other industry, but only in Malayalam industry.""Parvathy has often been referred as Lady Prithviraj. Responding to the tag, she said, ""It's supposed to be a compliment, right? Prithviraj speaks his mind, so do I. I hope he doesn't get insulted with people calling me that. He is one person who is thoroughly interested in a film's technical aspects and can go on at length about them.

"If my phone still rings for work, I feel successful: Vivek","Actor Vivek Oberoi started off his career on a high note with the film Company (2002). He established himself as the new heartthrob in Bollywood, after the romantic drama Saathiya (2002). However, after a series of flop films such as Fool N Final (2007) and Kismet Love Paisa Dilli (2013), many filmmakers wrote him off. However, this hasn?t dampened Vivek?s spirits. ?I don?t believe in analytics, I believe in living my life. If I start spending time analysing my choices, I will not be able to live my life. Success or failure is very relative. If I believe had I failed after Shootout At Lokhandwala (2007), then I wouldn?t have been around. I wouldn?t have had success with films such as Grand Masti, Krrish 3 or Prince. I wouldn?t be around at all. For me, a simplistic way of looking at life was that if my phone still rings and the other person says that ?I have a role for you in my film? I am successful,? he says.The actor, who has experimented with various genres and roles, does not believe in categorising his work. ? I have never believed that characters are negative or positive, white or grey. Shade cards are for paints, not for actors. Anything that I find interesting, I become that person and then it?s done,? says the actor, who currently stars in a web series.In his career spanning over 15 years, the actor, who made his debut with Company, never found it difficult to portray different roles. ?The minute I am off camera, I am done. In the initial stages of my career I did a lot of experiments. I did Company and lived in slums for it and researched. After I would finish shooting for a film, it would be a little difficult to shake the character off but now after my shoot I believe that you have to shake it off otherwise it starts becoming a part of you,? he says.",entertainment,1799,58,70
Peruvian immigrants set on fire in Chile,"Two Peruvian brothers are recovering in hospital in the Chilean city of Antofagasta after being doused with petrol and set alight by a mob of Chilean fishermen in the port city of Tocopilla. Juan Jiménez Ninaja and José Díaz Ninaja were left with second- and third-degree burns to over half their bodies after the attack. The two brothers had collected seaweed in the region for five years, helping to supply a multimillion-dollar aquaculture export industry. Mainly shipped to Japan, China and France, the plants are used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as well as being eaten. The incident took place amid an increasingly heated debate over the recent surge in migration to Chile, mainly from other Latin American and Caribbean countries, and growing racial tensions in the Antofagasta region. According to Elizabeth Andrade, a Peruvian social worker and one of the leaders of a migrant squatter camp in the city of Antofagasta, the attack was triggered by competition between seaweed collectors. The brothers had received threats over the last few months and were in the process of clearing out their hut to leave Tocopilla when they were set upon, Andrade said. In recent years, 64 camps have sprung up around the city of Antofagasta. The camps? occupants receive some support from local authorities in terms of security and access to healthcare and education, while pro-migrant Chilean NGOs have also been working with the migrants to improve living conditions. Andrade said the local press bore some responsibility for fanning resentment against immigrants, by exaggerating the number of foreigners involved in criminal activities and calling for the expulsion of all immigrants. ?It?s really difficult for migrants to adapt to Chilean society, as well as for Chileans to live alongside so many foreigners ? they?re not used to it. But in the last couple of years there?s been a real surge in racial discrimination,? she said.Migrants? rights activists say that the incident underlines the urgent need for new legislation to replace outdated immigration law imposed by the Pinochet dictatorship in 1975, along with well-planned policies to deal with the recent surge in migration to Chile.",world,2196,40,70

Rape victims' mental age won't decide for trial under POCSO,"The biological age and not the mental age of a sexual assault victim will determine whether trial in the case will be held under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act of 2012, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday.The court order came on a petition raising a question of law as to whether the POCSO Act will apply where the mental age of the victim makes her a child despite her age.The PIL was filed by the mother of a 38-year-old rape victim suffering from cerebral palsy since birth, which has left her with the mental age of a six-year-old.The court had earlier stayed criminal proceedings in the case pending in a trial court.

Aadhaar holders must link it with PAN for tax returns: SC,"The Supreme Court today stayed the government's order to make Aadhaar card mandatory for PAN holders and said it can't be made mandatory for filing Income Tax returns.

The top court was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of a provision in the Income Tax Act making Aadhaar mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of PAN.""The primary Aadhaar act is voluntary for people, the subsequent amendment to the IT Act cannot make it mandatory. The Supreme Court's interim order permitted Aadhaar to be used only for PDS schemes, it can not be extended for I-T Act,"" Arvind Dattar, arguing for petitioners told the Supreme Court.

Delhi colleges may issue learners' licences to students soon,"Students in Delhi will get a chance to take a test and apply for a driving licence at their colleges, according to Delhi?s transport minister who spoke of a new system that is likely to be launched by September.According to a proposed plan, the government will empower educational institutions to issue learners? licences. To be eligible, students will need to be above 18 and score at least 6 out of 10 marks in an online test that will be administered by the institutions. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot told Hindustan Times that the project, which will be reviewed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia this week, is being expedited because the demand for learners? driving licence is highest among the 18-24 age group applicants.Currently, an applicant needs to visit any of the 13 motor licensing offices across the city to get a learner?s licence. Once implemented, it will be the first time that the government will authorise anyone apart from the MLOs to issue driving licences. ?More than 53% of those who took the learners? licence last year were in the age bracket of 18-24 years. Those between 25-35 years constituted 25% ? the second highest. So, primarily students are the ones taking these licences and authorising educational institutes will revolutionise the system,? Gahlot said. The project will begin with the government?s polytechnic colleges. Apart from this, seven colleges under the Delhi government such as the Ambedkar University are also being roped in. Around 88 colleges under Delhi University will also be included.

Dr. Madhumita Kale gives Mr Molt a check-up on his birthday on Friday.

The oldest penguin, Flipper, is the most dominant and is very protective of her family, said caretakers. Donald and Daisy and Popeye and Olive, were obvious couples and were named so. City-based activists, however, were irked when they got to know Mr Molt was made to wear a t-shirt. ?While activists have been repeatedly telling Mumbai pet owners not to put clothes on dogs as it raises their body temperature, here we have specialists from the civic body torturing penguins like this,? said Anand Siva, animal welfare activist from Chembur. ?By putting a shirt on its body, the body temperature is being trapped and since these birds are kept in a cool climate, they can suffocate.?Zoo authorities said the penguin was made to wear the shirt for just a few seconds. ?It was done under proper supervision of the doctor. It was for a few seconds and removed after that. All the penguins are healthy. We know the rules and the systems to take care of them,? said Dr Sanjay Tripathi, Byculla Zoo director.

The Humboldt penguin is a south American species from coastal Peru and Chile.Play time?

NFL player retires to complete math doctoral degree at MIT,"Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel has abruptly retired from the NFL after just three seasons, the team announced on Thursday.The 26-year-old from Winnipeg, who is a doctoral candidate in applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was expected to compete for a starting role at center or guard in training camp, which gets under way this week in suburban Baltimore.Urschel?s surprise decision comes two days after the release of a medical study that further underscored the link between the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and participation in football. Researchers at Boston University and the Boston Veterans Affairs health system examined 111 deceased NFL players? brains that were donated to scientific research and found CTE in 110 of them, or 99% of those studied.The Baltimore Sun and ESPN said that Urschel?s decision was linked to the results of the study, citing anonymous sources close to the team.Urschel?s agent, when reached by the Guardian on Thursday, said the player has no statement or comment and will not be doing media at this time.?This morning, John Urschel informed me of his decision to retire from football,? Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement Thursday. ?We respect John and respect his decision. We appreciate his efforts over the past three years and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.?Urschel has been pursuing his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the offseason with a concentration on spectral graph theory, numerical linear algebra and machine learning. He earned his bachelor?s and master?s in mathematics at Penn State, where he played on the football team and was chosen by the Ravens in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL draft.A January profile of Urschel for HBO?s newsmagazine Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel found the lineman at odds with reconciling his two gifts. He further elaborated on the dilemma in a first-person essay for the Players? Tribune in 2015.?I recognize that this is somewhat irrational, but I am doing it,? Urschel told HBO?s Bernard Goldberg. ?It?s more important to me that I?m able to do the two things I love. I don?t know if people have really done things that I?ve done before. I don?t know if they?ll do it after me. But I enjoy carving out my own path and not listening to what people say I can and I can?t do.?By retiring after three full seasons, Urschel is eligible for an NFL pension.Urschel is not the first player to attribute early retirement to fears over the connection between football and CTE. In March 2015, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland retired after one season, a promising rookie campaign that saw him lead the team in tackles, due to concerns over the long-term effects of head trauma.",general,2798,58,70
Govt plans to make Connaught Place car-free on weekends,"Delhi?s iconic shopping arcade, Connaught Place is set to go car-free and become pedestrian-friendly from August even though traders opposed the move, fearing it would kill their business.An official of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) who did not wish to be named said the council plans to carry out the pedestrian-only campaign in the weekends.?We plan to close down vehicle movement from 4pm on Friday and will continue it on Saturday and Sunday. This will be a soft launch of sorts in August, after which we can proceed towards making CP a no-vehicle zone in phases based on the response,? the official told HT.?We will study traffic flow, parking issues and experiences of pedestrians and shop owners,? he said, adding that based on the feedback, they will decide whether to make the arrangement permanent.The three-month trial for a car-free Connaught Place, which the NDMC had planned in February, was put off after opposition from traders at the popular shopping hub.Traders have threatened to protest again, saying Saturdays, Sundays, and even Mondays were peak days of business for them.?We are absolutely against it. It is not practical at all to not allow vehicles inside Connaught Place. And this soft launch is the perfect way to kill business. ?Saturday and Sunday and even Monday are the peak days for us. We will go all out to stop it. We can?t allow them to kill our livelihoods,? New Delhi Traders? Association (NDTA) president Atul Bhargav said.Traffic at Connaught Place is a nightmare on most days.

Nearly 2,000 parking spaces ? 1,500 in inner circle and 400-500 in middle circle ? are to be removed.Authorities had proposed two ways to implement the project. In the first, cars will be allowed to enter from Janpath, people will alight at Palika Bazar or Palika Parking and exit through Baba Kharak Singh Marg. The second plan had proposed that cars will be allowed in the middle circle but only to drop visitors and shoppers, making it a no-parking zone.Officials say free ?park and ride? services from major parking areas at Shivaji Stadium, Baba Kharak Singh Marg and Palika parking will be made available. The council has plans to make battery-operated vehicles and cycles-for-hire available to get to and come back from Connaught Place.Pedestrian-only zones are popular abroad. London, Montreal and Copenhagen have areas where no vehicles are allowed. Many cities in Europe and Asia also have car-free zones. In Puducherry, Goubert Avenue that runs along the French Quarters is closed to motorised vehicles after 5pm.",general,2838,56,70
All options against Pakistan open: Army chief Bipin Rawat,"As tension with Pakistan remains at an all-time high over frequent ceasefire violations and funding of terror in Jammu and Kashmir from across the border, Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat today said all options are open against the belligerent neighbour. In details of a high-level meeting in Srinagar to discuss border security, accessed by India Today, General Rawat is reported to have discussed ""all options"" against Pakistan's aggression along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border. General Rawat had visited Jammu and Kashmir last week to review the security and also met state Governor NN Vohra to discuss the security situation. His statement comes as tension continues to simmer along the India-Pakistan border, with several ceasefire violations being reported in recent months. Last week, a civilian was killed and two others, including a BSF trooper, were injured in firing exchanges between Pakistani and Indian troops along the LoC.On the same day, Pakistan also summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Islamabad over fresh ceasefire violations on the Line of Control, claiming that one Pakistani civilian was killed. The Army on May 23 had released a video of attack on Pakistani posts across the LoC. The video showed what appeared as bunkers in a forested area being bombed and smoke and fire billowing up after the explosion.The mutilation of Indian soldiers by Pakistani border forces, the Kulbhushan Jadhav trial, and the funding of Kashmiri separatists to fuel unrest in the Valley as exposed by India Today have been the other sticking points between the two countries.Also read:The gloves are off: Hardliner Gen Bipin Rawat fights Kashmir insurgency, with government's backing",general,1728,57,70
Respect Pakistan's sovereignty: China tells US,"By K J M Varma Beijing, Jun 22 (PTI) China today asked the US to respect Pakistans sovereignty and backed its all-weather ally for being on the ""forefront"" of the fight against terrorism, amid reports that the Trump administration is exploring tough measures against Islamabad for harbouring militant groups. ""Pakistan is an important country in South Asia. Peace, stability and economic development in Pakistan serves the interest of regional countries and people,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told the media here. He was responding to reports that the US is exploring hardening its approach toward Pakistan to crackdown on Pakistan-based militants launching attacks in Afghanistan. ""Pakistan is on the forefront of global fight against terrorism. It has been firmly opposing terrorism and it has made important sacrifice and contribution to fighting terrorism and maintaining regional security and stability,"" Geng said. The foreign ministry spokesman said the international community should acknowledge that and support the counter terrorism efforts made by Pakistan on the basis of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week during a Congressional hearing on the State Departments annual budget proposals said that the Trump administration is beginning an inter-agency policy review of relations with Pakistan and the president has specifically asked questions about the level of support and funding to Islamabad. Media reports, quoting US officials, said potential Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding US drone strikes, redirecting or withholding some aid to Pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistans status as a major non-NATO ally. Afghanistan has also been strongly critical of Pakistan, accusing it of harbouring hard-line Taliban factions. Asked about reports from Pakistan that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is likely to visit Pakistan and Afghanistan this weekend to defuse tensions between the two neighbours, Geng said China continue to have friendly exchanges with the two countries but declined to confirm reports about Wang?s visit.",general,2177,46,70

20 held for lynching Kashmir cop near mosque,"No one knew who Jammu and Kashmir police officer Mohammad Ayub Pandith was on the night he was stripped and lynched in Srinagar last month and his identity became clear only the next morning, the Valley?s top police officer said on Monday.Inspector general of police (Kashmir range) Muneer Khan told reporters that 20 people were arrested for the crime on June 23, when thousands had gathered for night-long congregational prayers on Islam?s holiest night of Shab-e-Qadr. The lynching was widely condemned across ideological leanings in the Valley and across the country.Describing the events of the night, Khan said 57-year-old Pandith, who was in plainclothes, was confronted by four men coming out of Jamia Masjid allegedly shouting slogans in support of Zakir Musa, a top militant who has called for Islamic rule in Kashmir. The men allegedly were at the mosque to welcome separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.?Four of the miscreants saw the deputy SP checking the deployment -- he was on duty for access control.

"Lived in slum, used public toilet to get Company role: Vivek","#NotAllStarKids, the hashtag would read, if social media got wind of what Vivek Oberoi had to go through to bag the now-iconic role of Chandu in Ram Gopal Varma's 2002 film Company and made the story viral. Unlike the popular belief that industry kids get it easy, turns out it was not easy for Vivek Oberoi to convince RGV that he could pull off the character of Chandu.Company, which completed 15 years this week, is one of Bollywood's most iconic gangster films of all time. Written by Jaideep Sahni (who later went on to write Chak De! India) and directed by Ram Gopal Varma, Company was a fictional retelling of the bloody, real-life rivalry between crime bosses, Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan.Fifteen years ago, Vivek Oberoi made his Bollywood debut with Company. Unlike conventional industry-kid debut vehicles which happen to be romantic films, Vivek Oberoi opted for a gritty, gangster film which was a risky career choice. But the film wowed critics and audiences alike and the rest is history.Speaking about how he got the role, Vivek Oberoi spoke to Hindustan Times and said, ""My father was planning to launch me in an Abbas Mustan film. But I always wanted to become an actor on my own, so I told him that I would like to go through my struggle. So I went to RGV sir's office, and told him to give me an audition for the role of Chandu. He did not know (then) that I was Suresh Oberoi's son. I told him my name was Vivek Anand. He told me I look too good for the role, and he wanted to cast someone who looked like a gangster from the slums.""Then, Vivek apparently asked for fifteen days from Ram Gopal Varma. He began staying in slums, sleeping on floors with mice roaming about, using public toilets and so on. Slowly, he began to look the part...""On the day, I was supposed to meet him, I took out some mud from a plant at his office and applied it on my face. I walked into his room, with a beedi in my mouth - I sat on the chair and kept my legs on his desk, and said, ' Ey yeh thobda kya dekh raha hai'. That convinced him,"" Vivek said.Vivek Oberoi also did a lot of stunts in the film despite acting in a movie for the first time.""I wanted to do everything, and I loved doing all the stunts. There was a sequence, in which I had to run for my life, jumping from one building to another in the bylanes of Kenya. For a steep jump, RGV had asked the stuntman to do it, and after he had finished the shot, RGV left. I, then persuaded the stunt director to shoot the same scene with me,"" Vivek said.",business,2516,60,70

"World no. 4 Djokovic to miss US Open, rest of 2017 season","Novak Djokovic will miss the rest of the tennis season with a persistent elbow injury and has announced that Andre Agassi has agreed to remain part of his team next year.After 12 months of upheaval on and off the court, speculation had mounted that Djokovic would take an extended break from tennis in order to recover from the right-elbow injury that forced him to retire during his Wimbledon quarter-final against Tomas Berdych. But while the 30-year-old?s decision to listen to medical advice means he will be absent from next month?s US Open, the world No4 vowed to return stronger than ever and expressed his happiness that Agassi will continue to coach him in 2018.?I will take this time to heal and do all the different suggested methods of rehabilitation and healing processes so I can get back on the court as soon as possible,? Djokovic said. ?It will take a couple of months at least without a racket and I hope after that I can start to train. I?m looking forward to building my body and my game and my team.?I?m happy to share that Andre Agassi is committed to stay with me next year. I want to thank Andre for being with me this year and sharing his experience and wisdom and I?m looking forward to getting back on the practice courts with him and having him in the box for any big tournaments.?Djokovic?s announcement came exactly a year after Roger Federer cut short his 2016 season with a knee injury. Written off at the time, Federer returned from six months out to win the Australian Open in January and Wimbledon earlier this month.Djokovic, who was speaking in Belgrade, hopes that a similar period of rest will allow him to rediscover his spark. The Serb has struggled ever since completing his career slam at last year?s French Open. He opted for the ?shock therapy? of ripping up his coaching team earlier this year before reaching out to Agassi, who joined him at Roland Garros on an exploratory basis, but Djokovic ran out of steam when the elbow problem that has troubled him for 18 months flared up against Berdych at Wimbledon.He has since sought advice from specialists, including the Serbian doctor Zdenko Milinkovic, who said Djokovic is suffering from a ?bruised bone due to excessive playing?.Djokovic has won 12 grand slams and has not missed one since making his debut at the 2005 Australian Open. He is set to slip to fifth in the rankings on Monday and could drop out of the top 10 by the end of the year. But Djokovic preferred to focus on the positives after his latest setback.?I?m very grateful, that?s the strongest emotion I?m feeling lately, even though as a professional it is not an easy decision to swallow,? he said.?I haven?t skipped any big tournament. I have played all the grand slams and probably 90% of the 1000 Masters series events. I was blessed to have a lot of success. I?m grateful for that. But I?m also very grateful that I kept my body very healthy throughout the years. I haven?t had too many injuries and especially no big injuries like this one that would keep me away from the tour for longer than a month.?It?s a new experience for me, new circumstances, but I?m trying to look at it from a brighter side. I have time where I can dedicate myself to healing and building up my body and strength and focusing on certain elements of my game that I never had time to work on. Now I have time to perfect it and build the foundations for the next five years or more. I really want to play professional tennis for years to come.?",general,3491,57,70

If passed, the proposal will be sent to the municipal commissioner for his reply followed by the state government. Talking about her proposal, Mhatre said, ?Working women are under tremendous stress these days. In the olden days, women were asked to step away from her normal duties, but with nuclear families today that is also not possible.? She added, ?While we are equal to men, we must also respect the fact that we are physically different. Women undergo many hormonal changes that become difficult to cope with.? Taking a cue from countries such as Japan and Italy, an organisation based in Mumbai recently decided to give off on the women an option to take off on the a paid leave on the first day of their period. The issue has caused a stir on social media with many objecting to the so-called ?privileged? leave. Experts from Akshara, a non-government organisation working for equal rights for women, however said that the proposal was not a great idea. Dr Nandita Shah, co-director at Akshara, said, ?Treating menstruation as a sickness is not right. Women have already proved that they can work even during their periods. If it is a discomfort for some women at times, it can treated as normal sick leave.? Shah also said that with menstrual leave becoming compulsory, employers will not be interested in hiring women.READ What?s the fuss around #FOP?

Tightening visa norms blessing in disguise for IT firms: Pai,"Hyderabad, Apr 12 (PTI) The tightening of H1-B work visa rules in the US would be advantageous to Indian IT firms as they would shift more work offshore and also be in a position to improve their billing rate, says industry veteran T V Mohandas Pai. The present business model of Indian IT companies -- offshore-onsite work ratio of 70:30 would now go up to 90:10, the former Chief Financial Officer of Infosys said. ""So, what will happen is they (Indian IT firms) will offshore more work and increase their competitiveness. They will do only ten per cent work onsite, and 90 per cent offshore,"" Pai told PTI. ""It can be done very easily for 70-80 per cent of the business. It will improve their competitiveness and make them better,"" he said. ""The new H1-B regulations are very good for Indian IT, and bad for companies which try to use it for cheap labour. First of all, Indian IT is not cheap because what they bill to clients is USD 125,000 to USD 150,000 per year (for an onsite employee),"" he said. ""The average pay is around USD 80,000-85,000 per year. They are unnecessarily getting a bad name, because some fly-by-night operators are trying to do body-shopping and spoil the name of the entire (Indian IT) industry,"" he said. The new regulations would play to the strength Indian IT companies because they have been reducing the number of H1-B visas they collected since 2014, he said. ""So, they are already getting prepared. It will increase the billing because it will create artificial scarcity in America, and allow Indian companies to bill more for work because there are not enough Americans to fill the positions that are needed"", said Pai, who is Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital.

And that's the core of TVF, a culture rooted in democratic and equal opportunities for everyone irrespective of gender, caste and background. We grew from a bunch of passionate, talented and inexperienced novices to a team of over 200 professionals, on the foundation of this very culture.TVF was, is, and always will be larger than any one individual and I believe we have only just started on our path breaking journey to be a young global organization.In the wake of the recent personal attacks, what really breaks me is the blemish on the brand's true promise. I have therefore taken the decision to step down as the CEO of TVF.I will be available as a mentor for the content team as they continue to deliver the stories you love us for. I transition from this role knowing that TVF is in safe hands, handling over the reins to Dhawal Gusai, who will take on the mantle as the CEO of TVF.

Prez Elections: Voters can't carry pens in voting chambers,"MPs and MLAs who vote to elect the next President on Monday have been barred from carrying their personal pens inside the voting chamber and will have to mark their ballot with a specially-designed marker, the Election Commission said on Sunday.Following the ink controversy in the Rajya Sabha polls in Haryana last year, the Election Commission has decided to use special pens for the electors to mark their votes in the presidential and vice presidential polls.Specially serial-numbered pens with violet ink have been supplied by the Election Commission to ensure that only the writing instrument issued by it is used by voters to mark their votes.?Before entering the voting chamber, a polling staff will collect personal pens from the voters and hand over the special pen to mark their vote on the ballot paper.?When the member comes out of the voting chamber, the special pen will be taken back and the polling staff will return the personal pen,? a Commission spokesperson explained the new rule.While announcing the schedule of the election, the poll panel had made it clear that use of any other pen could lead to invalidation of the vote at the time of counting under the Presidential and Vice Presidential Elections Rules, 1974.These special pens have been procured from Mysore paints and varnish Ltd which supplies indelible ink to the EC.In another first, the poll watchdog has also prepared special posters carrying dos and don?ts for the voters. It asks them to use only EC-issued pen and warns that no whip or directive can be issued to party members to vote in favour of any candidate. Since it is a secret ballot, the voters should not disclose whom they have voted for.Green-coloured ballot papers will be there for members of Parliament and pink for MLAs who vote in the election.The value of an MLA?s vote depends on the population of the state he or she represents. But the value of the vote of an MP does not vary -- it is 708.Hence, the different colour of ballot papers will help the returning officer count the votes based on the value. The total value of the electoral college is 10,98,903.The ballot boxes will be brought to Delhi for counting on July 20.The electoral college, which elects the President through the system of proportional representation, comprises elected MPs and members of state legislative assemblies -- a total of 4,896 voters including 4,120 MLAs and 776 elected MPs.While 233 are elected members of the Rajya Sabha, 543 are from the Lok Sabha.A total of 32 polling stations -- one in Parliament House and one each in the state legislative assemblies, have been set up.33 observers have been appointed by the EC to oversee the conduct of election.

Speaking to reporters in Chennai, Panneerselvam played the 'Amma' card and said it was important that members of the Mannargudi family be evicted if the AIADMK has to survive.Panneerselvam reiterated his demand for a probe into J Jayalalithaa's death and said details regarding her treatment should be made public.""Sasikala has betrayed Amma. The treatment and medicines given to Amma should be made public. A thorough investigation must be done into Jayalalithaa's death,"" Panneerselvam said.""We have to follow the path which Amma (Jayalalithaa) laid out for us. The way Sasikala brought back Dinakaran into the party and her own elevation as AIADMK general secretary...everything was unconstitutional,"" Panneerselvam, who revolted against Sasikala in February after stepping down from the CM's chair, said. ""That family (Mannargudi family) was not supposed to be in the party. Amma never wanted them in the party, they have betrayed her. Betrayers will have to go,"" Panneerselvam added.REVOLT IN EPS CAMPOn the other hand, the revolt inside the EPS (CM Edappadi Palaniswami) camp has spiralled out of control with senior ministers seeking deputy general secretary TTV Dinakaran and interim general secretary Sasikala Natarajan's removal. Sources said Dinakaran has also lost support of influential party leaders Jayakumar, SP Velumani, Thangamani and Vaithyalingam - who helped him enter AIADMK again after Jayalalithaa's death. The four leaders are apprehensive of their names being associated with health minister Vijaybhaskar who was raided by the Income Tax department earlier this month. ""They've completely surrendered to the Center as they are trapped now. If TTV quits his position within the party, they are likely to be saved,"" claimed a party leader. PANNEERSELVAM AS CM, EPS AS DEPUTY CM?As per negotiations tabled, Cabinet is ready to accept Panneerselvam as chief minister if Palaniswami is made his deputy. Palaniswami had reportedly asked for the role of general secretary as well. Madhusudhanan will remain as the presidium chairman.Surprisingly, a plan has also been formulated to bring Sasikala out of prison in 4 months if ahe quits the general secretary post Dinakaran is to not involve himself into party decisions but can be a party worker.

Mastermind of inter-state fake coins racket held in Delhi,"The Delhi Police special cell have arrested the kingpin of an interstate gang that made fake R 10 and R 5 coins at clandestine factories in Delhi?s Bawana, Haryana and Rajasthan, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar, police said on Tuesday. A Maruti Celerio car and fake coins of the face value of R17,390 were seized from the 39-year-old kingpin, Sweekar Luthra, even as his brother and partner in crime Upkar Luthra are still at large. They were into the illegal business since 1997. Sweekar was wanted in several cases of minting of counterfeit coins and in connection with the murder of his business partner in Bihar in February 2016. Apart from India, the Luthras were using fake coins in countries such as Nepal.This is the seventh arrest by Delhi Police in four operations. On October 1, the outer Delhi police busted the racket and arrested one Naresh Kumar with R40,000 in fake coins minted at a factory on the city?s outskirts. A week later, the special cell arrested two more members of the gang, Gulshan Kumar and his nephew Sachin, with counterfeit coins of R5.85 lakh. On October 15, Sanjay Sharma and Sunil Kumar were caught by the crime branch with 800 counterfeit currency coins of R10. Dyes used to make coins, two hydraulic machines and raw material was seized from them. Their interrogation led the police to a fake coin minting factory in west Delhi?s Peeragarhi.Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, DCP (special cell), said interrogation of the arrested persons revealed that the racket was run by the Luthra brothers. The two went underground and were evading arrest even as the police raided their possible hideouts. ?Sweekar was caught on Monday from west Delhi?s Mohan Garden,? said Yadav. Read: Building where fake coins were made was out of bounds for everyoneSon of an ex-Navy personnel, Sweekar told his interrogators that he took to crime in 1993-94 with snatching but was arrested soon. In 1997, his elder brother Upkar came in contact with Gulshan Gambhir of Dehradun, now dead, and learnt how to make fake coins. ?Luthras established a factory in west Delhi?s Nangli Sakrawati with Gambhir?s assistance and started minting counterfeit coins of R5 denominations. Upkar was first arrested in 1999 by the Connaught Place police but he neither disclosed his real identity nor told them about Sweekar?s role,? said Yadav. Upkar was soon released on bail bur he continued the illegal business and set up another such factory in Anand Vihar. He was arrested again but released on bail. By 2008-09, Upkar became known in this illegal trade but Sweekar?s name stayed hidden. When Upkar escaped to Nepal, Sweekar continued the business. Several people joined them in the illegal trade. A few of them were Satish, Pankaj Gupta, Ramesh Verma and others. In 2015, Verma tried to take over the business from Sweekar. Realising that he was losing his supremacy in the trade, Sweekar hired some contract killers and got Verma eliminated in Bihar?s Forbesganj in February. Upkar is suspected to be hiding in Nepal. How they operated*To mint counterfeit coins, a hydraulic machine, a metal processing machine (Lathe) and a surface grinder are required, besides raw material such as metallic sheets. *The gang members arranged the metallic sheets from Mayapuri and Tilak Nagar. *The shape of the coins are carved out of these sheets with the metal cutting machine . *After that, the fake coins are prepared with the hydraulic machine. *Anti-rust spray is sprayed for final finishing. *The fake coins are supplied to toll tax centres, weekly markets and small shop keepers in Delhi and adjoining states. *The gang collect Rs1,100 after supplying Rs1,000 in fake coins",general,3663,57,70

Firm told unpaid trainees to pay over ?17 lakh for leaving,"Capita, one of the UK?s largest outsourcing companies, has demanded payouts of up to £21,000 from graduates who tried to pull out of an unpaid training scheme under which they were not guaranteed a job.The company, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers and BBC licence fee collection, has been criticised for advertising a number of roles in its IT resourcing division that stipulate applicants must be a graduate and able to attend between two and four months of unpaid training in London or Manchester.Former trainees who spoke to The Guardian said they had been disappointed with the scheme, as the training consisted almost exclusively of online reading from a digital library without any direct teaching or on-the-job experience.One former trainee described the course as ?absolutely useless?. They said: ?All you get is academic textbooks to read. Anyone expecting a hands-on approach would be disappointed. I was offered a few opportunities by other graduate schemes and companies [during the Capita training] but I refused them as I was under the threat of a liability to pay £21,000. I thought at the end of it how foolish I was.?Another former trainee said that they had decided to leave after just over a year of working for Capita and had been asked to pay about £21,000. After protesting, the trainee ended up without her last month of pay, or about £1,200.?I think they knew I was vulnerable as I started as a graduate,? the trainee said. The trainee sought a new job after finding they were being used to ?fill HR gaps? rather than being given roles suitable to her training.Capita said that it now charged £13,000 to trainees who wanted to leave before completing their training and two years of work. It said it had previously charged different rates depending on the role involved.A spokesperson said: ?All participants in the training are made fully aware, at numerous times prior to commencing the training, that it is provided free of charge to only those people who successfully complete the course and are engaged by Capita or a Capita client. Those who successfully complete the training but cannot be found a role within 90 days also receive the training free of charge.?Further revelations about the Capita scheme come as it emerges that one of Capita?s rivals, FDM Group, a FTSE-listed company which works with the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, also demands graduates sign up to months of unpaid training in order to secure jobs.The group?s graduate programme includes up to 14 weeks of unpaid training, after which it says 99% of attendees are placed in a job.The company also demands that trainees pay up to £20,000 if they leave during the training or the first two years of work.A spokeswoman for FDM said: ?The professional training we provide is a major financial investment in our people and in line with employers who invest in their people, we have clauses in our contracts that look to recoup the cost of training with a cap of £20,000 if a person leaves during training or the first two years of consulting. We have a commitment to transparency with all applicants to ensure that they understand the terms clearly. Trainees have 14 days from when they start training to trial the programme and leave with no fees charged.??We have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.?Individuals undertaking our bespoke training do not engage in any work or provide any services for us or any of our clients until they have successfully completed their training, passed all relevant internal and external examinations and been assessed as ready for the workplace.?",business,3885,58,70

Paintings from ?200 cr collection go missing at Air India HQ,"An unknown number of paintings from a Rs 200 crore collection featuring renowned artists like MF Husain and Jatin Das, have gone missing from the Air India headquarters in Mumbai. The matter came to light after famous painter Jatin Das was contacted for a painting that he had made for Air India, for verification prior to sale. The Jatin Das creation, has been traced, a source said.The discovery, a serious setback to the Narendra Modi administration's in-principle yes to disinvesting the carrier, was made after a government ministry began assessment work in view of the privatisation of Air India.Air India faces a Rs 52,000 crore debt, and has assets valued at Rs 6,000 crore in addition to its fleet of airplanes worth Rs 20,000 crore.When contacted by India Today, Air India CMD Ashwini Lohani said he didn't want to comment. The airline's management has ordered a probe, sources said.A PUBLIC MUSEUM WAS IN THE WORKSTop sources confirmed that in 2011, Air India CMD constituted a committee of curators and artists to catalogue paintings and artefacts in the carrier's collection. Cataloging work began in the same year. The collection was stored in a hall in the Air India headquarters, and the idea was to open a public museum on the ground floor.According to sources, the missing paintings are perhaps the tip of the iceberg, and the status of other Air India assets needs to be verified. The ongoing evaluation is expected to bring out shocking details of the paintings that are missing. Air India officials however, refused to comment on the matter.

10k Mumbai mosquito breeding grounds destroyed in 6 months,"The insecticide department of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) visited around 62 lakh houses and found more than 10,000 mosquito breeding spots in 8,744 of them over the past six months. Officials said they collected Rs20 lakh in fine from residents who failed to eliminate mosquito breeding spots in their homes. Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC, said the civic body focussed its efforts on finding breeding grounds of dengue carrier Aedes aegypti and malaria carrier Anopheles stephensi. From January 1 to July 15, 10, 260 breeding spots were found, of which 7,586 had larvae of Aedes aegypti and 2,674 had those of Anopheles stephensi . ?The issue is serious because a single female mosquito lays around 100-150 eggs at a time. She does so four times in her life span, which is three weeks. Negligence could lead to breeding of 400-600 mosquitoes which carry dengue and malaria,? said Naringrekar. Officials said they visited 62.43 lakh houses in the city, some more than once, to destroy breeding spots. ?Not protecting water tanks, wells and surroundings from mosquitoes were the most common offences,? Naringrekar added. Data from the past two years suggested that 80% of dengue patients had breeding spots in or around their homes.Naringrekar said since mosquitoes only breed in fresh water, people can control the spread of the disease right from their own homes. ?We have been advising residents to clean ornamental trees, feng-shui plants, bamboo plants, money plants, plates, pots, refrigerators and air-conditioners regularly to avoid dengue infection.

Centre tells SC it can?t extradite Mallya before Jan 2018,"The Supreme Court told the Centre on Friday it won?t be able to sentence liquor baron Vijay Mallya in a contempt case in his absence.In response, the government said the process to extradite Mallya, wanted for defaulting on bank loan repayments worth Rs 9,000 crore, has been initiated and proceedings in the British Crown Court will start by December 4, 2017. Talking to HT, attorney general KK Venugopal said, ?Hopefully we should get him back by January 2018.? In May, India had asked the UK to expedite the request for extradition of Mallya and other Indian fugitives. Most of Mallya?s loans are tied to his Kingfisher Airlines, which was grounded in 2012.The Supreme Court, in May, found Mallya guilty of contempt and asked him to appear before it on July 10. A bench of justices AK Goel and UU Lalit said the 61-year-old businessman had failed to submit details of all his assets, upholding a plea by a consortium of banks to which he owes more than Rs 9,000 crore.The banks had moved the court after Mallya transferred $40 million he received from London-based liquor major Diageo Plc in February 2016 to his three children instead of repaying the loan.The money was received towards the $75-million debt settlement with Diageo following his resignation as chairman of United Spirits Ltd.Mallya hid details of his transaction with Diageo when he filed an affidavit in the court sharing details of all his movable and immovable assets, the court said. He also failed to obey court?s order to appear before it.",general,1518,57,70

He was awarded seven years rigorous imprisonment but that has been reduced to two years by the service,"" an IAF officer said.The IAF officer was a transport pilot and used to fly Antonov-32 cargo planes before he suffered an injury to his knee during a sports event after which he had to be grounded by the service.The charges leveled against the officer in the GCM included refusal to eat food, assaulting a senior officer during his custody in a missile base in Mumbai and stealing TV remote controls from the officers' mess, sources said.The officer had won a gold medal for the IAF in a national shooting championship and had claimed during his trial that he has been facing harassment and was victimised by his superiors since 2013 after he suffered a grievous knee injury after which he was transferred to Bhuj air base in Gujarat.The officer had earlier claimed that his career has been destroyed due to denial of proper treatment by superiors.

Noida admin proposes tax collection at DND toll plaza,"To reduce traffic congestion on the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway, the district administration has proposed that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) collect tax from commercial vehicles at the toll plaza on two lanes to the extreme left of the plaza.Officials said that the step has been taken to ensure that commuters do not suffer from long snarls during the peak hours, especially in evening. Officials said that the jams are caused due to the collection of tax by MCD from commercial vehicles 500 metres after the toll plaza.Earlier, MCD collected tax at the booths of the toll plaza through a concessionaire. However, the practice was discontinued after the Allahabad high court abolished toll collection on the flyway from October 26, 2016, following a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the Federation of Noida Residents? Welfare Association, a residents? body.The district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, BN Singh, said, ?MCD is collecting taxes in accordance with the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. It has set up a makeshift booth on the flyway for the purpose, where commercial vehicles halt and lead to lining up of other vehicles. A proposal in this regard has been forwarded to the Noida authority for its approval.?Singh said that after a clearance from the Noida authority, MCD will be asked to collect taxes from commercial vehicles on the two lanes specified for the purpose. The chairman of the Noida authority, Alok Sinha, has already agreed to the proposal.However, sources said that the chief legal advisor of the Noida authority has raised objections to the proposal, on the basis that booths cannot be handed over to MCD as the area comes under Uttar Pradesh and MCD cannot be made a party to it.According to the source, the legal advisor also cited the court order that no tax should be collected at the DND toll plaza.Commenting on the objections, the district magistrate said, ?The court order does not pertain to this move. It is in the larger interest of the public and I will take necessary steps for implementing it. I will ensure that the proposal is approved.?Meanwhile, the chairman of the Noida authority Alok Sinha welcomed the proposal of the district magistrate to ease the traffic problem. ?The matter has been taken into consideration and the authority has to check all legal aspects in this case.

England to allow gay men to give blood 3 months after sex,"Blood donation restrictions for gay men and sex workers are to be relaxed in England and Scotland under a series of equalities reforms announced by the government. Gay men will be allowed to donate blood three months after sexual intercourse instead of a year. Sex workers, who were previously banned from donating, will be subject to the same three-month rule.Advances in testing for blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B and C and HIV, prompted the advisory committee on the safety of blood, tissues and organs to recommend the reforms to the government, which ministers accepted.Fears over infections being passed on through donations from gay men led to an outright ban at the height of the Aids epidemic, but that was cut to 12 months in 2011. The rule changes on blood donations will be implemented from November in Scotland, and early 2018 in England.Transgender people will also be able to choose their legal sex more easily as part of the equalities reforms announced by Justine Greening. ?This government is committed to building an inclusive society that works for everyone, no matter what their gender or sexuality, and today we?re taking the next step forward,? the education and equalities secretary said.?We will build on the significant progress we have made over the past 50 years, tackling some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving LGBT people a real say on the issues affecting them.?Reforms making it easier for transgender people to chose their sex legally, by removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn.Greening said she wanted to reduce the stigma faced by trans people, who have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to change their gender legally.Theresa May indicated earlier this week that she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act, saying: ?When it comes to rights and protections for trans people, there is still a long way to go.?The reforms have been widely welcomed by LGBT campaigners. Ethan Spibey, founder of FreedomToDonate, which campaigns against blood donation restrictions for gay and bisexual men, said: ?Today?s announcement from the government marks a world-leading blood donation policy for gay and bisexual men and the other groups previously restricted. I?m so proud that the work of FreedomToDonate and our supporters will help ensure more people than ever before are allowed to safely donate blood.?I began this campaign because I wanted to repay the donor who saved my granddad?s life after a major operation, and this announcement means I?m closer than ever to doing that, with the invaluable help of our team of volunteers, and the charities and organisations FreedomToDonate represents.?Suzanna Hopwood, a member of the Stonewall trans advisory group, said: ?Reform is one of the key priorities in our vision for removing the huge inequalities that trans people face in the UK. The current system is demeaning and broken. It?s vital that this reform removes the requirements for medical evidence and an intrusive interview panel, and finally allows all trans people to have their gender legally recognised through a simple administrative process. That?s what we?ll be calling for during this consultation, and I?m looking forward to seeing the law change soon after.?",world,3433,57,70

It was in the course of that iconic series that the then Indian captain Ganguly, had got to the Australians' nerves by delaying the toss.Sixteen years later, Shane Warne, who was an integral part of Steve Waugh's team, said he was okay with what Ganguly did in his home turf and thought it was a smart, aggressive move to derail the Aussies by coming out late for the toss.However, Ganguly, who was present along with Clarke for the session titled ""Warnie, Pup and Dada"" show, reiterated that Warne wasn't as accepting of the tactic back in 2001: ""Everytime I came out to bat , he would pitch the ball outside leg and remind me to play the game in the right spirit.""Known for their wit and humour, both Ganguly and Warne kept 'sledging' each other as the audience burst into laughter. However, their mutual respect was palpable.""I have seen Warne sledge me throughout. We were playing for different counties and he would see me come out and he would sledge me. Even when it was Rajasthan Royals vs Kolkata Knight Riders, he would come at the toss and start sledging me from there itself. And all this happened for a period of 10 years. But he's a fabulous bowler and the best I have faced. I have played against Muttiah Muralitharan too and I'm lucky to get some runs against both of them,"" Ganguly said.Warne said he got sledged by Ganguly in equal measure.: ""Sourav never said a word back - can you believe that ?""But Warne showed his admiration for Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag - known as the Fab 5 of Indian cricket and said their contributions towards Indian cricket was immense. ""Don't ever underestimate how good these guys are - I would much rather bowl to the modern day Indian guys than these guys. India became one of the best sides in the world under Sourav,"" Warne said.Warne said sledging Ganguly made the legendary Indian batsman more determined than ever: ""I sledged him thinking I could get him out this time but that only made him more determined. It was under Sourav that India because one of the best sides from one of the better sides because he gave them the toughness, the feeling of not going under any team.""Clarke, who had captained Australia with great success after Ricky Ponting stepped aside, said he was lucky to play the game alongside legends such as Warne and Ganguly.""The players I idolised I got to play with and against - it's a great example of why you play the game. They were so competitive on the field. That's why the game is so special.",sports,2943,56,70

A Kerala temple has 'Judge Uncle' deity for legal issues,"Neck-deep in legal trouble, a mining baron from Bellary from Karnataka has finally decided to knock on the doors of the ?Judge Uncle? in neighbouring Kerala?s Kottayam district.The judge in this case is the presiding deity of a small shrine located at the corner of the Cheruvally Sree Devi temple of Kottayam with an ever growing reputation of helping people wriggle out of legal mess. The belief is Judge Ammavan (Uncle) does not disappoint and the mining baron mired in legal cases has made the trip to the temple to make a special offering.Those who throng the temple are controversial figures and to give them anonymity, the shrine opens just for 15 minutes and that too only in the night, after the main Cheruvally temple closes after evening prayers.Visitors at the temple are the veritable who?s who of south India: Malayalam actor Dileep is in jail for his alleged involvement in the abduction and sexual assault of a top actress and his brother Anoop was at the temple to offer special prayers on his behalf.P Gopalakrishnan, the president of the Travancore Dewasom Board that administers the famous hill shrine at Sabarimala was also here last November when a petition challenging its age-old tradition of not allowing women into the temple was being heard at the Supreme Court.The top court is yet to give its ruling on whether to allow women into Sabarimala, but devotees of ?Judge Uncle? believe his blessings are a sure shot way to salvation. The Bellary baron is facing a myriad of court cases including some relating to mine lease violations.?One of my cases will come up before the court soon and my astrologer advised me to visit the Judge Uncle,? he said on the condition of anonymity.According to folklore, the temple has its roots in 18th century when the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore had a judge named Govinda Pillai who was known for his impartial judgments. Once, his nephew was involved in a criminal case and Pillai ordered his execution. Later, evidence surfaced about the nephew?s innocence.Pillai was filled with remorse and he approached the king, requesting that he be punished for his erroneous judgment. The king said the judge must decide his own punishment, following which Pillai ordered his own execution. He also ruled that his body be exhibited at a public place for three days.Pillai?s commitment to justice moved many and the people later built a temple to ?give eternal peace to his soul?. The case diary with Pillai?s own observations on Palmira leaves ordering his execution serves as the deity of the temple.?People from faraway places come here. And many believers request the temple to keep their identity confidential,? said temple manager Gopinathan Nair.?People involved in minor disputes to major crimes come here with lot of hope,? said Deva Narayanan, a retired government employee.

Karnataka has drinking water to last only till June 15,"Karnataka water resources minister MB Patil has appealed to the state's denizens to use water judiciously, reminding them that there's just enough water for drinking purposes till June 15.Patil today held a meeting with officials belonging to various departments, to work out how best to optimally use water until the onset of the monsoon. With Karnataka reeling under a severe drought for the past three years, the state government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that citizens aren't facing too much trouble. But with the available live storage in the reservoirs touching an all-time low, there's very little the government can do to supply continuous drinking water.As of today, this is the level of water in the state's reservoirs.- Almatti dam: 12 TMC (TMC - one thousand million cubic feet)- Narayanapura dam: 15 TMC- Hidkal dam: 7.6 TMC- Hipparge dam : 0.8 TMC- Malaprabha dam: 1.7 TMC- Tungabhadra dam: 3.7 TMC- Bhadra: 8.5 TMC- KRS: 4.438 TMC- Kabini dam: 0.295 TMC- Harangi dam: 1.228 TMC- Hemavathi dam: 1.787 TMCWATER RATIONING BEGINS?""We will coordinate with different departments and ensure that as a team there will be efficient use of water,"" Patil said. However, he hinted that agencies such as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), KWSSB and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department (RDPR) can take a decision on rationing water. Similarly, district administrations can stop farmers from utilizing pumpsets, since Patil said, ""there's is water for agricultural purposes and what we have is only for drinking."" WATER SHORTAGE IN BENGALURUThe problem that Bengaluru is suffering today is due to the fact that only a third of the city gets Cauvery water on a daily basis, as per the tribunal's orders. The other parts of the city make do with borewells and water tankers. ""We have allocated around 9 TMC of water to the peripheral areas of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) but that will take time,"" Patil said.He added that the BWSSB and BBMP would manage that issue in due course of time.Patil said that in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya and surrounding areas, water is being supplied at 800 cusecs per day, and this should suffice till June 15. The KRS dam and the Kabini dam together have around 4.7 TMC, and the requirement for 60 days will be around 4.5 TMC, which is manageable, he said.ALSO READ | Bengaluru 'water warriors' challenge citizens in city to be 'water kanjoos' this summer",general,2442,54,70

"Give us EVM for 72 hrs, will show how to rig it: Kejriwal","The Election Commission (EC) has refuted the allegations of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress over the controversy surrounding EVMs and claimed that no such machines have been moved from Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of bye-elections in Madhya Pradesh.Earlier, AAP chief Kejriwal once again demanded that the upcoming civic polls in the capital must be conducted using paper ballots. He wrote to the EC claiming that ""our experts"" will prove that the voting machines can be tampered with. ""I challenge the ECI to give us 72 hours to prove it,"" he said in the note. In a press statement today, the EC called the allegations of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress as ""baseless"" and clarified that VVPAT machines are not required by the law to be retained in strong room for the purpose of election petition and are available for use in any other election.However, in the ongoing by-elections only VVPAT machines, which were kept in reserve and not used during the actual poll, have been redeployed.WHAT THE EC STATEMENT SAIDThe EC statement said, ""Certain baseless observations and allegations have been made by a leader of a political party today in a press conference regarding the use of EVMs. It has been alleged that EVMs as per law cannot be taken out for 45 days from the date of declaration of results but still EVMs for the by-polls in the Madhya Pradesh were taken out and shifted from Uttar Pradesh where the results have been declared on March 11, 2017 and hence the 45 days period is still not over.""Clarifying the legal position, EC said the EVMs comprising the Control Unit (CU) and Ballot Unit (BU) used in any election are kept in a strong room after declaration of results and are not accessed by anyone till the period of filing of election petition is over. The election petition has to be filed within 45 days.However, in case of VVPAT machines, the printed paper slips have to be retrieved at the time of counting and sealed in a paper envelope and only these sealed paper slips have to be kept inside the strong room along with the EVMs.It further said, ""The VVPAT machines are not required by the law to be retained in strong room for the purpose of election petition and are available for use in any other election. However, in the on-going bye-polls only VVPAT machines which were kept in reserve and not used during the actual poll, have been redeployed.""""Aspersions have also been cast on EC that EVMs from Uttar Pradesh were moved to Bhind, Madhya Pradesh. The Commission would like to point out that these allegations are completely baseless and made without verifying the facts. No EVMs have been moved from Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of bye-polls in Madhya Pradesh,"" it said.The statement claimed that required number of VVPAT machines was moved from different states for use in bye-polls as per the existing policy of EC. ""This is because 53,500 VVPAT machines, available with the Commission, were deployed during the recently concluded polls in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur.""The Commission would like to clarify that in any election a certain percentage of EVMs and VVPAT machines are kept in reserve so that EVMs and VVPAT machines deployed on the poll day can be replaced, if required. The EVMs and VVPATs kept in reserve also go through the stringent protocol of first level checking, randomisation and loading of symbols during the candidates setting in the presence of representatives of candidates and political parties. Hence, the VVPATs that were sent to Bhind had the previous symbols loaded from Uttar Pradesh,"" it said.EC said, ""This is a standard protocol and there was nothing amiss in this. According to standard protocol, the old symbols are erased only during first level checking before the next poll. However, it was not done when the demonstration was made on March 31, 2017 at Bhind. As per the Commission's instructions, any training or demonstration is commenced only after completing the first level checking which was missed out at Bhind for which Commission has replaced the District Election Officer,"" and added that the report of special officer deputed to inquire into allegations of multiple printing of paper slips of a particular political party at Ater (Bhind) is awaited and would be made public.Also Read:EVM software is bugged, dare Election Commission to reveal its name to us: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal",politics,4425,58,70

Sena MPs had approached Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju seeking his intervention into the matter, but they failed to get any assurance from him. SHIV SENA THREATENS TO CREATE RUCKUSShiv Sena MP Anand Adsul, while speaking in the Zero Hour on Wednesday, said that no one was listening to his party. ""Just because we are in the government does not imply we cannot create ruckus"", he threatened. Adsul will move an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on April 6 on the issue of blacklisting of Gaikwad by airlines and the government's alleged failure to take action against them. If sources are to be believed, Shiv Sena is going to raise this issue prominently once Gaikwad reaches Parliament. Despite trying hard to get the government to lift the travel ban, Sena has not found any success yet. It seems the BJP is, rightly so, avoiding backing the Shiv Sena on an issue that has evoked so much nationwide outrage.Gaikwad, who hails from Osmanabad in Maharashtra, had allegedly hit an Air India staffer 25 times with a slipper on board a Pune-Delhi flight. This prompted Air India to ban him and other airlines followed suit with the result that he had to travel back to Maharashtra by August Kranti Rajdhani Express after he couldn't book an air ticket on any carrier.GAIKWAD FAKED HIS NAME TO GET FLIGHT TICKETThe aggrieved Air India staffer also lodged two FIRs against Gaikwad in Delhi, investigation into which is still on. Gaikwad tried to fly 4 times even under false identities, but his ticket could not be processed. Facing scathing criticism over the incident, the Shiv Sena had earlier assured that it would reprimand Gaikwad, but that never happened. In fact, the party began defending his action soon after. Senior leaders of the party think that they are being cornered by the BJP on this issue as they have found no support from anywhere. This has prompted the Sena to resort to an aggressive and unruly show of strength, and Parliament is likely to witness uproarious scenes over the issue on Thursday.Also read | Slippergate: Shiv Sena to protest in Parliament if MP Ravindra Gaikwad's flying ban is not liftedAlso read | Grounded MP Gaikwad tweaked name 4 times to book Air India tickets",general,2847,55,70
Delhi govt to install CCTV cameras at bus stops,"After receiving complaints from commuters that drivers do not stop buses at designated stops, the Delhi government has decided to install CCTV cameras at bus stops.Not halting the bus at the designated spot but close to the bus stop not only leads to chaos and congestion on roads, but it also poses a challenge to the differently abled, senior citizens, women and children.?Cameras at bus stops will also help us investigate cases of speeding and rash-driving. People wait at bus stops for a minimum of 10 minutes in Delhi and this would also ensure safety of commuters, especially women,? a transport official said. The project has been pegged at a cost of Rs140 crore, which will be taken from the Nirbhaya Fund. ?The government has already received in-principle approval for its share from the fund from the ministry of home affairs. Besides, the need for cameras at bus stops apart from buses was cited by the MHA only,? another official said.At present, the capital has 1,864 bus queue shelters (BQS), of which 1,321 are managed by the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (DTIDC), 346 by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) and 197 by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).The practice is so common among drivers of the government-run buses that the transport department is already carrying out a drive to prosecute them. It has formed an 80-member team of enforcement officials who in just five days have prosecuted 1,296 such drivers. The officials, dressed in plain clothes, have been deployed at bus stops like Dhaula Kuan, ITO, AIIMS, Mukarba Chowk, Peeragarhi, Laxmi Nagar and INA.?From July 10 to 15, we have taken action against 393 drivers of DTC, 454 drivers of the cluster or orange bus service and 449 of metro feeder buses and gramin sewas,? the official added. In June, the Delhi Cabinet, in its meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved installation of CTTV cameras in 6,350 Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses. However, at present, there are only 5,725 buses being run by the government and 536 more buses are in the pipeline.",general,2135,47,70

My fees not even 10% of what rumour says: Pak lawyer at ICJ,"According to a Geo News report, Khawar Qureshi, the lawyer representing Pakistan at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has blamed the Indian government for the 'baseless propaganda' surrounding the case fee he charged, something that became a rallying point for many on the social media to poke fun at him. What exacerbated his misery was the obvious comparison with Harish Salve, the Indian counsel in the case, who took just Re 1 as his court fee, a symbolism of his commitment to his motherland.The lawyer, who has been blamed by many experts and politicians in Pakistan for not preparing well for the case and leaving many loopholes in his arguments, told Geo News that ""references to his fees were complete lies fabricated by Indian Twitterati and Indian nationals behind such baseless propaganda may have government backing"".The ICJ decision yesterday, staying execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan till the case was underway in the UN court, saw a rush of tweets on how a highly paid but ill-prepared Pak lawyer could not stand the legal wisdom of Harish Salve who charged just Re 1. The speculation on Twitter about his fees was largely based on media reports from Pakistan that quoted his fees for the case at around 5,00,000 British Pound, i.e., a whopping 7 crore in Pak currency and around 4.25 crore in Indian currency.So, even if Qureshi says that ""his fees were not even 10 per cent of what the Indian propaganda suggests"" and even if he justifies the amount he charged by saying he ""cancelled another professional commitment with another government to travel to Pakistan urgently"", he would always find it difficult to justify even this reduced gap, i.e., at 10 per cent of the claims being made, between Harish Salve's Re 1 winning gesture to his Rs. 42.5 lakh case fee, especially when he wasted 40 minutes of the 90 minutes given to his team to present its side of the arguments. To add to Qureshi's misery, Indian team under the leadership of Salve used its full 90 minutes.Qureshi might have given ""a 30 per cent reduction on his fees, besides covering the cost of two of his juniors' fees"", as he claims, the bottom line is, he is being slammed in Pakistan for mishandling the case and his high fees, even at 30 per cent discount, is not giving him any room to breathe easy because Pakistan has made Kulbhushan Jadhav's case a prestige issue and the yesterday debacle saw a mourning like atmosphere there.It is true that the ICJ has given only an interim stay of Jadhav's execution and Pakistan and Qureshi say they have enough evidence to prove their case in the course of hearing, the truth of the moment is, India has scored a clear diplomatic victory over Pakistan and a moral boost for further case proceedings at the ICJ.Earlier in the day, a news came from Pakistan that it was going to have a new legal team for the case, but now Pakistan has filed a plea in the ICJ to rehear the case within six weeks with reports saying that Qureshi will continue to represent Pakistan. So, now that Qureshi is going to remain there, he has now the opportunity to silence his critics, both on his legal acumen in the case and on his exorbitant fee. Let's see if he can match Harish Salve.ALSO READ:Pakistan's plan ahead after Nawaz Sharif govt slammed on ICJ's Kulbhushan rulingKulbhushan Jadhav case: Pakistan set to re-challenge International Court of Justice's jurisdiction",general,3404,59,70

"Bill tabled in LS to recall MPs, MLAs over poor performance","New Delhi, Feb 28 (PTI) MPs and MLAs should be recalled within two years from being elected if 75 per cent of those who voted for them are not satisfied with their performance, according to a bill moved by BJP MP Varun Gandhi. ""Logic and justice necessitate that if the people have the power to elect their representatives, they should also have the power to remove these representatives when they engage in misdeeds or fail to fulfil the duties,"" Varun said. Stating that the countries all over the world have experimented with the concept of Right to Recall, the Lok Sabha MP has proposed an amendment in the Representation of the People Act 1951 through his Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2016. As per the legislation, recalling process can be initiated by any voter of the constituency by filing a petition before the Speaker, signed by at least one-fourth of the total number of electors in that constituency. After confirming its authenticity, the Speaker will move the application to the Election Commission for its verification and authentication of the voters signatures on it. The Commission will verify the signatures on it and will organise the voting on 10 places in the respective constituency of MP or MLA, it says. If three-fourth of the votes that member was polled in his election, go in favour of the recall process, the member will be recalled, the bill proposes. Within 24 hours of the receipt of the result, the Speaker will notify the result to the general public. Once the seat gets duly vacated the Commission can organise a bypoll in that constituency. ""A free and fair election is the right of the citizens of the country and in the event of their elected representatives no longer enjoying their confidence, the people must have a right to remove them,"" Varun said.",general,1810,59,70

Diesel cars 10 times more toxic than trucks and buses: Study,"Modern diesel cars produce 10 times more toxic air pollution than heavy trucks and buses, new European data has revealed.The stark difference in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is due to the much stricter testing applied to large vehicles in the EU, according to the researchers behind a new report. They say the same strict measures must be applied to cars.NOx pollution is responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths across Europe, with the UK suffering a particularly high toll. Much of the pollution is produced by diesel cars, which on the road emit about six times more than allowed in the official lab-based tests. Following the Volkswagen ?dieselgate? scandal, the car tests are due to be toughened, but campaigners say the reforms do not go far enough.The new report from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a research group that played a key role in exposing Volkswagen?s cheating, compared the emissions from trucks and buses in realistic driving conditions with those of cars.It found that heavy-duty vehicles tested in Germany and Finland emitted about 210mg NOx per kilometre driven, less than half the 500mg/km pumped out by modern diesel cars that meet the highest ?Euro 6? standard. However, the buses and trucks have larger engines and burn more diesel per kilometre, meaning that cars produce 10 times more NOx per litre of fuel.The ICCT analysis showed that manufacturers were able to ensure that heavy duty vehicles kept below pollution limits when on the road, but that emissions from cars soar once in the real world.Official EU tests for cars are currently limited to laboratory measurements of prototype vehicles. ?In contrast, for measurement of NOx emissions from trucks and buses, mobile testing devices became mandatory in 2013. As a consequence, randomly selected vehicles can be tested under real-world driving conditions,? said Peter Mock, managing director of ICCT in Europe.Changes to the car testing regime in the EU are due to start in September, with mobile devices, called portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS), attached to vehicles as they drive on real roads. But Mock warned: ?Manufacturers will still be allowed to carefully select special prototype cars for emissions testing. Instead, it would be much better to measure the emissions of ordinary mass-production vehicles, obtained from customers who have had been driving them in an ordinary way.? Such a system is used in the US where the dieselgate scandal first emerged. It will also be put forward for discussion by the European commission on 17 January in Brussels, but the ICCT said it faces resistance from some vehicle manufacturers and EU member states.In December, the European commission started legal action against the UK and six other EU states for failing to act against car emissions cheating in the wake of the dieselgate scandal. But later the same month, a draft European parliament inquiry found the European commission itself guilty of maladministration for failing to act quickly enough on evidence that defeat devices were being used to game emissions tests.Evidence that some diesel cars emitted up to four times more NOx pollution than a bus was revealed in 2015. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and a lead negotiator on the EU?s air quality law, said ?It is disgraceful that car manufacturers have failed to reduce deadly emissions when the technology to do so is affordable and readily available. The dramatic reduction in NOx emissions from heavier vehicles is a result of far stricter EU tests, in place since 2011, that reflect real-world driving conditions. If buses and trucks can comply with these limits, there?s no reason cars can?t as well.??

"I-T Dept issues ?24,646 cr notice to Sahara's Aamby Valley","New Delhi, Apr 25 (PTI) The Income Tax department has issued a Rs 24,646 crore tax demand notice to Sahara Groups Aamby Valley Limited (AVL) after conducting a special audit of the company. The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it. A Sahara Group spokesperson confirmed the development to PTI. ""Yes, the Income Tax Department has raised Rs 48,085.79 crores to the income of the Aamby Valley Limited with a total demand of income tax of Rs 24,646.96 crores on the Aamby Valley Limited,"" the spokesperson said in a brief statement. Officials said the notice was issued by the taxman in January this year after the special audit of AVLs income for the Assessment Year 2012-13 found that the parent firm had allegedly floated a clutch of Special Purpose Vehicles whose incomes were later accounted on the account of AVL as they were merged with the former in due course of time. The AVL, in its income return filed for AY 2012-13, had reflected a loss of few crores but the special I-T audit brought up the added income, a senior official said.

"Sunil Gavaskar was the 1st batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs","Talk about small steps and giant leaps. On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. That run also took Gavaskar to a territory which, never mind the batsman, even cricket itself had never seen. Fifty seven to fifty eight sent Gavaskar from 9,999 to the first 10,000th run in Test cricket. Non-striker Kiran More says Gavaskar celebrated that moment like he usually didn't do in cricket. He sprinted. Or at least that's what it seemed like to millions watching TV because it was an accomplishment that all of India wanted to own quickly. So we believe that in that instant, this deliberate, determined Indian batsman was quicker than usual. His head slightly lowered, mid-single, Gavaskar raised his bat in both triumph and celebration. AlsoBy evening, he was out for 63 and they say when he returned to the dressing room, at first he was not satisfied, but furious. Gavaskar's principle never changed: every run counted, every innings had to be maximised. So 10,000 had been achieved but to not extend that innings of 63 irked him. If he ever got out after getting in, dressing rooms would usually clear out to give the infuriated maestro his space. When play ended, what he did have though, was contentment, ""I would have just been happy with 1,000 runs. Now I feel 10 times more fantastic."" No wonder, even in the dry state of Gujarat that night, they sourced some champagne to go with the cake. India did not know it then but Gavaskar was to play only one more Test after Ahmedabad. When he retired later that year, the country was in deep gloom: Indian cricket's defender, its most gritty general had gone. He had re-defined the standards of excellence and professionalism, re-written definitions in the school of Indian batsmanship. It is said he has no mementos from the match in which he crossed 10,000, but he wouldn't need any: Sunil Gavaskar's achievement always carries with it the power of everlasting memory. --by Sharda Ugra",general,2117,60,70

16 yrs since Laxman and Dravid's 376-run stand against Aus,"Back in the summer of 2001, India were far removed from the modern-day Test giants they were - even on home soil, when a mighty Australia came to visit for a three-Test series.India, it would seem, were hardly prepared for the men from down under. They had been whitewashed 3-0 by the Aussies the previous summer and on their return home, South Africa drubbed them 2-0.There was then the one-off Test against Bangladesh and two more Tests against Zimbabwe. India managed two win two of those but not without stiff resistance from the opposition.And when the much-hyped series against Australia got underway in the March of 2001, there was little doubt who would triumph. The Aussies, led by Steve Waugh, steamrolled India in Mumbai to extend their winning streak.Things looked just as bleak in the next Test at the Eden Gardens. Australia had piled up 445 and India were knocked out for 171 and following on, were tottering at 115/3 when Rahul Dravid joined VVS Laxman in the middle. The Eden crowd was aghast. Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, the most established batsmen in the team, were gone and Australia were breathing fire.Laxman had shown class in his 21 Tests up until that point - few would have forgotten his 167 in Sydeny. Dravid was considered to be extremely talented but India had yet to see the flair they would go on to produce for the next decade.March 14, 2001 was when they first saw what these two could do. With their backs against the wall, India roared back as Laxman and Dravid orchestrated one of the greatest comebacks in Test cricket. They were 254/4 at stumps on day 3. When the duo resumed proceedings on the fourth day, Australia would have hoped to wrap things up quickly.",general,1708,58,70

Fire in electronics factory in Noida kills six,"Six employees of a factory that manufactured electronic goods were burnt to death after a fire engulfed a five-storey building in Noida?s Sector 11 on Wednesday.The incident was reported around 2.30pm at the factory that is located in F Block of Sector 11 near the Delhi-Noida border, police said. Some of the bodies recovered were charred beyond recognition.One of the employees, police said, sustained severe spinal injuries after he jumped down from the fifth floor.Employees, who survived the blaze, said that fire tenders reached the spot at least 90 minutes after the first call was made to the police. Fire department officials, however, rubbished the claims and said they rushed to the spot as soon as they were informed.The fire station is located just two kilometers away from the site of the incident in Sector 2. ?Twelve fire tenders, one 32 meters and another 42 meters hydraulic lift machines reached the spot within 30 minutes of being informed. It took us time to reach the spot because of traffic and encroachment on the road. Our Ghaziabad staff also reached the spot and lent us a helping hand,? said Aman Sharma, a fire department official. Initial estimates suggest that good sworth at least Rs 15 crore was gutted in the fire.Sources also said that the blaze also brought to the fore major lapses with regards to jurisdiction. Employees trapped inside the building said they kept calling 100 to inform Noida police about the incident but their call was diverted to neighbouring Delhi and Ghaziabad. A factory employee, Sheeshpal, said, that the fire broke out around 1pm. ?When we dialed 100, the call connected to Delhi police control room. Later, when we again tried to contact the police, the call connected to Ghaziabad police control room. After several attempts, we finally connected to Noida police control room,? he said. Sheeshpal said 12 employees worked in factory. ?It appears that fire started due to a short circuit on the third floor. We were trapped on the third floor after the blaze started. While four employees rushed upstairs after the blaze, the others rushed downstairs. One employee, Vivek, jumped from the fifth floor to escape the blaze,? said Ashish Kumar, another employee. The condition of Vivek is stated to be critical.?We swung into action as soon as we were informed about the fire. Over a dozen fire tenders were sent to the spot to douse the flames. Prima facie it appears that a short circuit may have triggered the fire,? said Aman Sharma, fire officer.Police said that the death toll may rise as there might be other bodies in the basement of the building.",general,2616,46,70

Railways cancels caterer's contract as lizard found in food,"New Delhi, Jul 26 (PTI) The railway ministry today cancelled a caterers contract after a passenger found a dead lizard in his vegetable biryani served on a Delhi-bound train from Howrah, a ministry spokesperson said. The passenger had ordered and eaten the dish without noticing the lizard but felt unwell later, a co-passenger, Meghna Sinha, said in a series of Tweets yesterday. ""In view of the Railways zero tolerance policy towards poor quality and overcharging of food, the railway administration has terminated the contract of the catering contractor, R K Associates, for the Howrah-New Delhi Poorva Express,"" Railway Ministry spokesperson A K Saxena told PTI.

Infosys COO Rao's pay spectacular but not performance: Pai,"Hyderabad, Apr 3 (PTI) Backing Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthys view on pay hike to COO U B Pravin Rao being ""not proper,"" companys ex-director T V Mohandas Pai today said the salary in this case is ""spectacular"" but performance is not. Alleging that Infosys board was ""misguided"", Pai said the """"fundamental problem"" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka ""without any justification"", because of which other executives were also expecting higher pay. He said salary levels in India cannot be compared with that in the US. ""I totally agree with Murthy that it was not proper. We should have Indian norm for compensation; we cant follow American norm, we (Infosys) are not an American company,"" Pai, who was also formerly Chief Finance Officer of Infosys, told PTI in a telephonic interview. The comments come at a time when a row has erupted again between some founders and the current management of the firm. Pai argued that at a time when the salary for entry level software engineers had not been raised in the IT industry in India for the past seven years, it is totally wrong to hike the compensation for top-level executives. ""The starting salary for software engineers has not gone up for the past seven years; and the inflation in the last seven years is about 60 per cent,"" he said. The salary of Chief Operating Officer (of Infosys) three-four years ago was Rs 3.5 crore or Rs 4 crore. Now, it has gone up to Rs 12 crore, according to the Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital. ""I think unless people at the bottom (software engineers) get good, regular hike, paying people at the top for doing nothing...for long period of time is totally wrong,"" Pai said. Without naming Rao, he said, ""That too we have been paying (compensation hike) for a person who has been in the company for 30 years."" ""If somebody has done spectacularly well, then its okay. Performance is not spectacular. Salary is spectacular,"" he said. ""I think the Board was misguided. You hired a CEO (Vishal Sikka). You are forced by the CEO to increase (his) salary from USD 7 million to 11 million. There was no justification,"" he said. ""When you see CEO getting so much, then COO will say: what about me? I cannot be paid one-tenth of what CEO is being paid,"" he said. ""The fundamental error was increasing CEOs salary from USD 7 million to 11 million without any justification,"" Pai further said. Raising the CEOs salary was the ""fundamental problem,"" and it could now lead to top-level executives and executive committee members seeking a pay hike, he said.",general,2583,58,70

Diamond ring bought for ?900 expected to fetch ?3 crore,"A large diamond ring is expected to fetch £350,000 at auction 30 years after its owner paid £10 for it at a car boot sale, thinking it was a costume jewel.The ?exceptionally sized? stone was presumed not to be real because 19th-century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like today?s gems. The owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.The 26.27-carat, cushion-shaped, white diamond, snapped up at a Sunday sale at the West Middlesex hospital in Isleworth in west London in the 1980s, is going under the hammer at Sotheby?s on 7 June. The head of the auction house?s London jewellery department, Jessica Wyndham, said: ?The owner would wear it out shopping, wear it day-to-day. It?s a good-looking ring. But it was bought as a costume jewel. No one had any idea it had any intrinsic value at all. They enjoyed it all this time.?They had been to quite a few car boot sales over the years. But they don?t have any history of collecting antiques and they don?t have any history of collecting diamonds. This is a one-off windfall, an amazing find.?Wyndham said that after about 30 years of wearing the ring, the owners brought it into Sotheby?s after a jeweller told them it could have substantial value.?They came in with the idea that it might be real and they had no idea of its value,? she said. ?We had a look and said ? I think that?s a diamond, and we got it tested at the Gemological Institute of America. The majority of us can?t even begin to dream of owning a diamond that large.? Wyndham said the owners, who did not want to be named, are ?incredibly excited. Anyone would be in this position. It?s a life-changing amount of money. No matter what your background is or what your past experiences have been, it?s going to revolutionise someone?s life?.The diamond is thought to have been cut in the 19th century but its history and how it arrived at the car boot sale are unknown.Wyndham said the older style of diamond cutting was ?slightly duller and deeper than you would see in a modern style ? it could trick people into thinking it?s not a genuine stone?.She added: ?The diamond cutter is looking to maximise the amount of brilliance from the stone because that?s what makes it sparkly,? she said.?With an old style of cutting, an antique cushion shape, the light doesn?t reflect back as much as it would from a modern stone cutting. Cutters worked more with the natural shape of the crystal, to conserve as much weight of the crystal rather than make it as brilliant as possible. The older stones have quite a bit of personality. They sparkle in a different way.??Serendipity? may have prompted the owners to buy the ring in the first place, she said, ?but a 26-carat, cushion-shaped diamond, no matter how filthy or dark that mount was, maybe that stone still speaks to people. They also bought some designer dresses for about £10. We should have all been at the car sale!?",general,2967,55,70

Chinese woman uses plastic surgery to evade over ?23 cr debt,"A 59-year old woman from the central Chinese city of Wuhan transformed her appearance through plastic surgery in order to avoid 25 million yuan ($3.71 million) of personal debts, state news agency Xinhua said. In a case highlighting the challenges facing China as it tries to establish a ?credit society?, police officers were reported to be ?astonished? after apprehending the woman, who fled to the southeastern Chinese city of Shenzhen after a court in Wuhan ordered her to pay off her debt.?We were very surprised at the scene,? the official Xinhua news agency quoted a policeman as saying. ?She looked in her thirties and was different from the photos we had.?The woman, identified as Zhu Najuan, also confessed to using other people?s identity cards to travel across the country by train. She financed her plastic surgery using borrowed bank cards, Xinhua said late on Friday.Representatives from more than 300 Chinese cities released a declaration earlier in July promising to make more credit available for consumer spending, part of the country?s efforts to find new sources of economic growth and reduce its dependence on heavy industry and state-driven infrastructure investment.But as the country strives to make more credit available to individuals, it is also facing a surge in household debt, which is estimated to have reached around 50 percent of gross domestic product last year, more than doubling in less than a decade. As regulators try to establish a reliable nationwide credit rating system, authorities across the country are also exploring new ways to crack down on those who do not pay debts. According to state media, one court in Jiangsu province has drawn up a blacklist of defaulters. Anyone who telephones an individual on the blacklist will first be forced to listen to a pre-recorded message saying ?please urge this person to fulfil their legal obligations?.Xinhua said the city of Wuhan has also launched a series of crackdowns on debt defaulters, and detained a total of 186 people in the first half of the year.",world,2056,60,70
Who is the Shiv Sena MP who hit an Air India staffer?,"Three years ago, 11 Shiv Sena MPs created a ruckus at Delhi?s Maharashtra Sadan, where one of them force-fed a Muslim catering worker during the month of Ramzan. Among the MPs was Ravindra Gaikwad.The 56-year-old Gaikwad is in the eye of the storm again for beating up an Air India staffer after a Pune-Delhi flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday morning. This incident, or the Maharashtra Sadan episode, was not Gaikwad?s first run-in with the law.As per his affidavit filed ahead of the 2014 General Elections, Gaikwad has three criminal cases against him. In the past, the Osmanabad MP has been booked for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and criminal intimidation.As per the affidavit, one of the cases was registered in Tuljapur, Osmanabad on March 13, 2003, while two other cases were registered in Omerga, Osmanabad, on January 9, 2013.On Thursday, a defiant and unapologetic Gaikwad admitted that he hit 60-year-old Air India duty manager R Sukumar ?25 times? and has dared Air India to take action against him. ?It was not my fault, it (the AI?employee) was his fault. He should apologise. First ask him to apologise then we will see,? Gaikwad told mediapersons in Delhi on Friday.He has been summoned by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to Mumbai, even as the airline and other domestic carriers come together to demand a no-fly list for ?unruly passengers? such as him. The MP was upset because he had to shift from business class to economy after a change of aircraft.Senior Shiv Sena office bearers say that the MP is leaving Delhi at 7pm on Friday to meet Uddhav at his residence in Bandra.Three years ago, after the Maharashtra Sadan incident, Uddhav Thackeray had supported the MPs and no action was taken against them. A PIL filed in Delhi High Court to disqualify the 11 MPs was dismissed later.",general,1911,53,70

""Afghanistan is currently doing badly both in the fighting and in its civilian politics, governance, and poverty. Pakistan is still a sanctuary for the Taliban and Haqqani network and more of a threat than an ally,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a report.The report by Anthony H Cordesman, CSIS's Arleigh A Burke, Chair in Strategy, said there has to be a better strategy and a better approach to both the military and civil dimensions of the war to provide a reason to stay.""No commitment should be open ended. The Afghans have to do far more, and do it far better, to justify each future year of US commitment,"" it said.""The United States should make it clear to Pakistan that it faces a total end to aid, and the imposition of sanctions, if it continues to support the Taliban and tolerate the Haqqani network,"" the report added.'RUSSIA SHOULD STOP SUPPORTING TALIBAN'Russia should be told that any end to US sanctions will depend on it not supporting the Taliban, and the Unites States should reach out to China to make it clear that Chinese cooperation in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan can serve both Chinese and American interests, the report said.CSIS said the US should make it totally clear that it will conduct a public annual review of its commitments to Afghanistan and the Afghan performance.""It should make it clear that it can and will leave in the face of Afghan failure. If necessary, the United States should make good on such a threat,"" it said.""It should send a clear message to all 'partner states' that they must meet reasonable standards of performance. The United States should never bully its allies, but it also should not be bullied -- or let nations slip into the kind of overdependence that ultimately undermines rather than aids them,"" the CSIS said.
